['', '', '', 'Donald Trump, Accidental Buddhist - The New York TimesDonald Trump is the contemporary master of a little-used literary device: the narcissistic third person. On the indictment of Paul Manafort: “There’s not even a mention of Trump in there.” On the possibility of Russian interference in the 2016 election: “Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?” Even his very first tweet, back in the innocent days of 2009, employed this peculiar mirror-gazing perspective: “Be sure to tune in and watch Donald Trump on Late Night with David Letterman ….”Like so much else that Mr. Trump favors — red baseball hats, caps lock — referring to oneself in the third person has, these past few years, come to seem tainted, almost pathological. It has entered the cultural lexicon — suitable only for the toweringly grandiose (LeBron) or the deeply immature (Elmo). When the writers of a drama wish to signal that someone is soon to die of tuberculosis, they have her cough blood into a handkerchief. When they wish to signal that someone suffers from a terminal case of self-regard, they have him refer to himself in the third person.Which accounts for the sheepishness I feel when I tell you about my recent discovery: that referring to yourself in the third person is, well, kind of wonderful. Lately I’ve been walking around with an inner monologue that runs something like this: Ben is feeling tired; Ben is considering blowing off the gym; Ben is feeling regret about eating that entire baguette while walking home from the grocery store.And I’ve not only found my ego swelling from all this Ben-ing. I’ve also found it tamer than ever before, as manageable and mild as a baby panda. Much as it pains me to admit, I’ve come to believe that our egotist-in-chief may have stumbled onto something profound.Allow me to explain.At the core of Buddhism is the concept of non-self. The idea, basically, is that the thing you think of as you — the entity whose well-being occupies your every waking thought — is an illusion. This doesn’t mean that your body is a hologram — that Uniqlo-clad lump of meat is indisputably there. What non-self refers to, rather, is the thing that you think of as your true self — the little captain who lives somewhere behind your forehead and looks out through your eyes. The thing that says, “I hope people like me” or “I can’t stand another minute on this train” — that, Buddhists believe, is what needs to be seen through and rooted out.This teaching, Buddhists insist, has the potential to eliminate your suffering entirely. But it is destined to remain so much inert philosophy, no more life-changing than the quadratic equation, until you’re able to actually glimpse your little impostor, to fix him in your mental cross hairs. Which is where the Trumpian third person comes in.Because it turns out that what we refer to, when we refer to ourselves in the third person, is the very thing that Buddhists believe causes us so much trouble. When I say, “Ben can’t stand the taste of turnips,” I am forcing myself, at grammatical gunpoint, to inhabit a perspective outside my usual one. From this new vantage point, my feelings about turnips — not to mention the very thing that I’m used to thinking of as myself — appear as objects, separate from the one doing the speaking. Which means that I, just by shifting into the speech patterns of a narcissistic lunatic, have stationed myself out in the hard-to-describe spaciousness where Buddhists say we’d do well to set up shop.All of which is to say that referring to yourself in the third person — if you do it thoughtfully, and probably silently — need not be a step on the path toward “Celebrity Rehab.” It can instead be a means of finally realizing a life-altering truth. You are not your thoughts; you are not your feelings. Now that my inner narrator has alternatives to I think and I feel, these seem not like self-help platitudes but like observable facts.Does this mean that Donald Trump, when he goes on and on about “Donald Trump,” is demonstrating his enlightenment? That when he refers to himself in the third person, he is expressing not a personality disorder but an intuitive grasp of the subtlest Buddhist teachings? Ben highly doubts it.', '', 'Donald Trump, California, N.B.A.: Your Tuesday Briefing - The New York Times (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. Before we begin, if you’ve ever wondered how this briefing gets put together every day, your writer has the answer. Here’s what you need to know:President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell are trying a new approach: judges.In a surprise display of togetherness on Monday, the two men emphasized a mutual desire to fill scores of federal court vacancies.Our chief Washington correspondent, Carl Hulse, explains: “The courts are a longtime priority of conservative activists who have been grumbling about the failures of the Republican Congress, so a flurry of confirmations of nominees with known conservative views on cultural and government issues could quiet some complaints.”After months of tensions, Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell held a joint news conference in the Rose Garden. Here are some of the topics the president addressed.While answering questions, Mr. Trump falsely asserted that his predecessors, particularly Barack Obama, hadn’t contacted the families of American troops killed in duty.The Syrian Democratic Forces, an American-backed militia group made up of Syrian Kurds and Arabs, said today that it had liberated the northern Syrian city of Raqqa from the Islamic State.It’s a major blow to the militant group, which had long used the city as the de facto capital of its self-declared caliphate.Astronomers are excited.It was announced on Monday that they had observed a pair of dead stars colliding, the first glimpse of the violent process by which most of the gold and silver in the universe was created.“I can’t think of a similar situation in the field of science in my lifetime, where a single event provides so many staggering insights about our universe,” an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago said.We have a video to explain it all, and answer some questions about the discovery.One of our reporters, Caitlin Dickerson, visited a remote village in Puerto Rico devastated by Hurricane Maria.Residents, she said, “were quick to point out that other Puerto Ricans were living in worse circumstances, though it was hard to imagine whom they could have been talking about.”And in California, the wildfires are far from over, but officials are confronting the next challenge: the huge amount of debris and ash that will be left behind.“Just think of all the hazardous materials in your house,” the chief public health officer in Napa County said. “Your chemicals, your pesticides, propane, gasoline, plastic and paint — it all burns down into the ash.”In the past two weeks, more than 30 women have accused the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct.There has been an outpouring on social media of stories of sexual harassment, punctuated by the hashtag #MeToo.Nina Jacobson, a film producer, predicted a change in the entertainment industry: “I think the floodgates being opened is something that had to happen, and that finally brings a subject to the surface that has sort of gone unchecked for countless years.”In today’s show, we discuss the guilty plea by Sgt.

In 2002, sponsorship passed to the Man Group, an investment management firm, which added its name to the title.The award was initially open only to writers from Britain, Ireland, Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth. Eligibility expanded in 2014 to include any English-language novelist, raising concerns that it would become dominated by Americans. (Since then, one U.S. novel — Paul Beatty’s “The Sellout” — has won. Half of the authors on this year’s shortlist are Americans.)Winners receive 50,000 pounds, or about $66,000. Howard Jacobson, who won in 2010 for “The Finkler Question,” told The Guardian that he was going to spend the prize money on his wife: “Have you seen the price of handbags?”Sara Aridi contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning.

Trump’s office has been home to every president since Taft; Atamanuik’s used to belong to Stephen Colbert. I visited in late August, when Atamanuik was still settling in. There were big windows and high ceilings with exposed rafters. There was an executive bathroom. He showed me a “WristStrong” bracelet, a relic of Colbert’s injury, that he had fished out of the rafters using a decorative saber given to him by J.D. Amato, his friend and former co-executive producer. The saber had “truth” engraved on one side of the blade and “satire” on the other.Everything in this office seemed to emphasize the gravity of Atamanuik’s position, and he paced its expanse like a chief executive or, possibly, a prisoner. Briefly alighting behind the desk, he told me it used to support two giant computer monitors that obscured his view of the room. He had to peer over them to talk to people, either craning his neck or awkwardly hovering above his chair, but he didn’t move them for weeks, because that’s how Colbert did it.For the last six months, it has been Atamanuik’s job to imitate Donald Trump on “The President Show,” a late-night television show on Comedy Central whose conceit is that the president hosts a late-night television show. This project asks Atamanuik to continue the legacy of past masters like Colbert and Jon Stewart even as he grapples with the most galvanizing public figure in modern memory — an easy task, so long as he manages to be really funny every week.Atamanuik regards the pressure as an opportunity. He sat in a tubular-steel chair in front of his desk and expounded on Trump as both symptom and ailment of our current politics, periodically returning to his computer to check the occasional fact — for example, whether his home county, Suffolk County, Mass., went for Trump in November’s election. (It didn’t.) A substantial television hung on the wall, tuned to MSNBC and connected to an Xbox by trailing cables. The south side of West 54th Street crowded the window to his right; on his left, a bookcase supported one shelf of shoes and two of political hardbacks, plus big-idea best sellers and Vintage Classics with lined spines. It was the library of a pop polymath, someone who had kept his books from film school and, against trend, added to them.“I would say I do an impression of his psychology,” Atamanuik said. “I do an impression of what I think his interior is.” Discussing the workings of Trump’s mind, Atamanuik alluded to the Jungian concept of the shadow self, to broad changes in the electoral politics of Boston during the 1980s and to the writings of Deepak Chopra, using these eclectic references to diagnose Trump as an “ideological splinter in our body politic.” He also mentioned the “Fibber McGee and Molly” radio show, “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” for Nintendo Switch and “The Golden Ass,” a second-century Roman novel about a man who turns into a donkey.“The thing about this that’s so great is that the main character goes through all these experiences,’’ he said, handing me a copy from the shelf, ‘‘and, at the very end of the book, learns nothing. This is Trump: the golden ass, a man who learns nothing from his experience.”Atamanuik accompanies this conclusion with an expression of astonishment, suggesting a discovery that was right in front of us all along. He has an improv comic’s physicality, with a tendency to lean forward as he approaches a punch line. At 43, he is transitioning from hollow-cheeked to round-faced — a quality that, in combination with the hoarseness of his voice, makes him seem jolly. He wears a fat suit to play Trump, but he shares the bigger man’s command of space and knack for hand gestures. In conversation, he tends to hold eye contact, an invitation to conspire.This time last year, Atamanuik was working on the “Trump vs. Bernie” tour, a traveling series of live comedic debates that pitted his Trump against a version of Bernie Sanders played by James Adomian. Before that, he appeared on “30 Rock” for seven seasons as a silent extra in the writer’s room, finally getting a line in the series finale. He also wrote and performed in various commercials and taught classes at the Upright Citizens Brigade. In November, he appeared live as Trump on an election-night special with the hosts of “The View.” He had written material for a loss. When it became clear that Trump was winning, he improvised. As the shock and disappointment faded — Atamanuik supported Sanders in the primary and Hillary Clinton in the general election — a part of him recognized that something good might be happening to his career.Nearly a year after the election, political comedy feels more important than ever. Yet for the most part, it has not gotten funnier. One might expect satire to thrive with such an outsize figure in the White House, but Trump comedy has felt strangely toothless. It has furnished his ideological opponents with neither the insights to undo his popularity nor the humor to make it bearable. It feels as if there were some point in the last year, between Jimmy Fallon mussing Trump’s hair and Alec Baldwin mugging his way to an Emmy on “Saturday Night Live,” when satire fell through on its promise to subvert. Atamanuik has committed himself to either being part of this problem or overcoming it.“The President Show” has done a bit of both. Atamanuik’s impression is so precise and disciplined as to be entertaining in itself, like a high-wire act. Jokes that present the president as a psychically damaged man-child — in one sketch, he sees a dump truck and begins an excited monologue about how fun it would be to drive, concluding that he would steer it into the river and drown so as to be “finally at peace” — harness a sardonic tension between silliness and despair. Peter Grosz is sedately brilliant as Mike Pence, the straight man forced to play sidekick to his temperamental opposite. When Trump returns from a trip abroad with a souvenir sword he calls Sexcalibur, Pence observes that he has already given several objects around the White House that name. Such jokes suggest a whole alternate world — in contrast to “S.N.L.,” which tends to imitate the world we know — and the show is at its best when it lives there.Sitting in Atamanuik’s office, I posed a hypothetical: If there were a button that made Hillary Clinton win last November but cost him his show and newfound fame, would he press it? Yes, he answered immediately, without a doubt. Here he is, though, doing his dream job in what he considers a nightmare scenario, paid to make the president funny at what is either the best moment for political comedy or the worst. The Trump presidency promises to cement his career as a satirist or, possibly, end it. After Colbert, his office belonged to Larry Wilmore, whose “Nightly Show” was canceled after two seasons. But when people talk about the office, nobody really mentions that.A funny Trump impression presents two broad challenges. The first is that the president exists in a cloud of signifiers: his infomercial hand gestures, his practiced facial expressions, his broad accent and narrow diction and relentless catchphrases, to say nothing of his hair and skin. Any impression of him must include these signifiers, but they are so numerous and recognizable as to weigh it down, limiting the space for the impressionist to contribute his own insights. The adage “It’s funny because it’s true” is a phenomenological account. It describes a change in the audience: It’s funny because (I just realized) it’s true. We laugh when we are surprised to recognize something. The problem with Trump is that everything about him is recognizable immediately. There seem to be no subtle truths under the cacophony of overt signifiers, so that every joke about him becomes merely a reference.Let us call this the Covfefe Problem, after the “covfefe” jokes that proliferated when Trump tweeted an apparent typographical error this spring. “Covfefe” is not funny, but it triggers shared recognition in a way that perniciously substitutes for humor. When Trump praised the nonexistent African nation of Nambia at the United Nations in September, Bill Maher joked that the capital of Nambia was Covfefe — an idea simultaneously arrived at by dozens of amateurs on Twitter. Social media worsens the Covfefe Problem by putting ideas in the public domain before late-night TV can get to them. Although Trump’s foibles seem to make him ripe for lampoon, they wind up being traps.The essence of the Covfefe Problem is that the actual Trump may be the funniest version of him anyone can think of. The second problem, however, is that most people paid to satirize him tend to find the material consequences of his presidency anything but funny. For the last two decades, political comedy has skewed liberal, and to liberals, almost everything Trump does seems simultaneously terrible and important.Let us call this the Clapter Problem, after a coinage by the late-night host Seth Meyers. As defined by Jim Downey — a former colleague of Meyers’s on “S.N.L.” — in an interview with Mike Sacks for his book “Poking a Dead Frog,” clapter is the response you get when political comedy inspires consensus rather than laughter. “Clapter is that earnest applause, with a few ‘whoops’ thrown in, that lets you know the audience agrees with you,” Downey says, “but what you just said wasn’t funny enough to actually make them laugh.”In combination, the Clapter Problem and the Covfefe Problem make it hard to say something funny about Trump but easy to provoke the kind of responses that make political comedy feel important. Lorne Michaels may have recognized this dynamic when he replaced the longtime Trump impressionist Darrell Hammond with Alec Baldwin just before the election. Hammond’s Trump was technical and subtle — the work of a career impressionist — while Baldwin’s is a summer-camp burlesque. After nearly every line, he produces a cartoonish pout for the camera — an expression Trump does not often make in real life and one that conveys little beyond the actor’s contempt for his subject. It’s an easy impression to cheer and a hard one to laugh at.Atamanuik believes the longer format of his show calls for a different approach. He identifies two core elements to his “psychological” impression of Trump. The first is the idea of the president as a petulant child — a person who grew up getting everything he wanted and continued that experience through adulthood. The second element is his refusal to pay attention. As a media personality, Trump’s brand is built on his power to dismiss anyone — literally on “The Apprentice” and figuratively during the Republican primaries. Atamanuik considers this dismissive quality central to Trump’s appeal, even among liberals. His Trump is a visible struggle between ego and id. Alternately stentorian and maniacal, he demands respect for the presidency even as he undercuts it with juvenile outbursts.During the cold open and the first two acts of each episode, Atamanuik remains in deep character, speaking and acting as Trump. During the interview, by contrast, he plays himself doing his Trump impression. The interviews employ a recurring joke in which Trump asks the guest, “Do you think … ” and then comes out with a long, cogent analysis. While discussing Republican criticism of Trump — and the lack thereof — with the conservative commenter S. E. Cupp, for example, he asks, never dropping Trump’s outer-borough intonation, “Do you think it’s because they care about maintaining control in a party system that’s so partisan that it actually counteracts the ability for people to govern?” Then he goes back to choppy, self-aggrandizing pronouncements. It’s a tone-shift gag. Trump suddenly becomes Atamanuik the satirist, experiencing an insight that he shrinks away from at the last second to revert to his oblivious self, the golden ass.The secret to this effect is eerie verisimilitude. Before each show, Atamanuik spends about two hours in hair and makeup while a team of technicians reproduce Trump’s distinctive appearance. I observed this ritual in a frigid cluster of dressing rooms beneath the soundstage. Surrounded by snacks and bottles of makeup, Atamanuik sat in the chair under a black smock and played music from his phone through a Bluetooth speaker at high volume, alternately singing along, checking emails and drying his face with a hand-held fan. He prefers tracks he can bellow: “Tell All the People,” by the Doors, and “Send in the Clowns,” as well as, in a higher register, “Touch of Grey,” by the Grateful Dead.In contrast to the creators of the show, whose television experience is relatively limited, the hair and makeup team is full of ringers. His makeup artist Tom Denier Jr., who is responsible for recreating Trump’s signature skin tone, is a “Saturday Night Live” alum with three Primetime Emmy nominations. One of two wig technicians, Robin Maginsky Day, showed me Atamanuik’s Trump wig. Each hair was individually hand-tied into a custom lace foundation. The process of building it took the other wig technician, Bettie Rogers, about 46 hours. As Day showed it to me, Denier used an airbrush to apply layer after layer of makeup to Atamanuik, who wore goggles to recreate the pale circles under Trump’s eyes.Apparently summoned by the opening bars of Abba’s “When All Is Said and Done,” Grosz entered in bald cap and flannel shirt, trailed by his makeup tech, Vincent Schicchi, who also worked on “Saturday Night Live,” from 1997 to 2006, and did Will Ferrell’s makeup a couple times during his George W. Bush years. Ferrell’s Bush has arguably been the most successful political impression of the 21st century so far. He was another president whose actual administration made him profoundly unfunny to liberals, but Ferrell’s portrayal of him as a happy-go-lucky frat boy captured what made him likable to his base: He didn’t pretend to be smart. Atamanuik has built his Trump around a similar core — not of likability but of dismissiveness, the quality that made him a hero to voters who felt alienated from the political class. It is this sense of his appeal, even amid the show’s evident disdain for Trump the president, that makes Atamanuik’s impression sustainable.Denier applied the last coat of makeup and stepped away, raising his hands in a gesture of finality as Rogers and Day moved in with the wig. They lowered it onto Atamanuik’s bald-capped head together, steadily but gingerly, in a scene that called to mind Darth Vader in “The Empire Strikes Back.” “The wig does a lot for him,” Grosz observed dryly. Atamanuik wore the wig and makeup to tech rehearsal, running through the script in sweatpants and an undershirt. Then he returned to his dressing room to put on the fat suit and prepare.A mixed but mostly young crowd filed into the theater, interlarded with conspicuously older relatives of the show’s staff. The warm-up man was Craig Baldo, who entered wearing jeans and a baseball cap. He did about 15 minutes of crowd work, struggling at first but finally bringing them around with some jokes about New Jersey. Once the audience got rolling, he introduced Atamanuik, instructing them to give him a big welcome and laugh at everything he said.They seemed to take this instruction seriously. The line “Thank you all for coming” got a big pop. Just the impression was funny to them. Atamanuik took several questions as Trump, improvising his answers and consistently getting laughs. The executive producer Adam Pally, who spent most of the taping haunting the wings, told me they learned early on that this portion of the process was crucial. It gets the crowd used to the impression, which is deep enough to make them nervous at first. Are they supposed to hate this person? Atamanuik called on “the Jew with the glasses,” who asked what Trump meant by his remarks after Charlottesville. “I’m a pig,” Atamanuik answered, “a disgusting, racist, Nazi pig.” It wasn’t funny, exactly, but it let the audience know exactly where Atamanuik’s loyalties were. Everyone clapped.The next day, Atamanuik had lunch at John’s of Times Square, the pizzeria where he worked for years, an island of insider New York in the tourist district. Its elaborate front bar is larger than most pizzerias. The main dining room is cavernous, with a mezzanine and a two-story mural that overlooks multiple service stations. The staff is a platoon, and they all seemed to know Atamanuik, who greeted them with the magnanimity appropriate to visiting your old day job. When the salad arrived, he warned that the first scoop was always a spill risk. “I can still do it,” he said, dishing it up. “It’s so funny; it comes right back to you. Also, weirdly, the smell of cocaine comes back. This is when I was doing a lot of blow.”He paused, presumably to consider that this was not the kind of memory he should share with a reporter. His trajectory from pizzeria to late-night host was too improbable to keep to himself, though. Atamanuik is from Topsfield, near Boston, but after his parents divorced when he was 6, he moved to the decidedly less affluent Chelsea, Mass. He lived with his mother in a duplex they shared with her parents, who introduced him to “Your Show of Shows” and Abbott and Costello. His mother taught at Emerson College, where he took a degree in film theory before moving to Los Angeles for a brief stint in the internet division of the Jim Henson Company. Then he went to New York and worked at John’s while he took improv classes. His is a recognizable story of dislocated class — a person who grew up with artistic ambitions but graduated into circumstances that required him to work.As Trump, his tagline at the end of the cold open for each show is “I’m the president. Can you believe it?” Atamanuik carries that can-you-believe-it attitude around with him. Improv comedy teaches you many things, and one of them is how few talented people actually make it. The basements of New York are full of talented people. Atamanuik seems aware of this reality and how he might go back to it at any time. This precariousness fuels his determination to capitalize on his opportunity.“I want mine to be realer than his,” Atamanuik said of the relationship between his performance and Trump’s. “By that, I am taking him. I want to make it where people go, ‘Anthony first, Trump second.’ ” This plan, undertaken in 22-minute increments on basic cable, might charitably be called ambitious. Yet what Atamanuik calls his “grand vision” is not without precedent. Dana Carvey did it on “Saturday Night Live,” when he persuaded a generation that George H. W. Bush routinely said “not gonna do it” and “wouldn’t be prudent” — two catchphrases the president didn’t actually use. And The Onion’s hard-partying, earnestly sleazy Joe Biden became the template for parodies of the former vice president, a fictional version on which subsequent fictions were based.There is also the matter of how many times Atamanuik’s Trump has prefigured the actual president’s behavior. Celebrating House passage of the American Health Care Act on May 4 at the White House, the real Trump said to a group of Republican lawmakers, “I’m president. Can you believe it?” When Mario Cantone appeared on “The President Show” as Anthony Scaramucci, Atamanuik introduced him as “my favorite new team member, who I will eventually betray.” Four days later, Scaramucci was fired. Atamanuik’s Trump looked at the solar eclipse without glasses and predicted that North Korea’s threats against Guam would promote tourism. Trump did both.It still seems credulous to imagine that Atamanuik could ever eclipse Trump. For one thing, Trump’s entertainment-industry résumé is much longer. He was doing film and television cameos while Atamanuik was still in college, appearing in “Home Alone 2,” “Sex and the City” and a seemingly endless number of late-’90s sitcoms. He had his own television show for more than a decade in “The Apprentice” and then “The Celebrity Apprentice,” each of which ran in prime time on NBC. Trump was a higher order of celebrity than Atamanuik even before his presidency. But watching the impressionist talk about his plans for his show in the pizzeria where he didn’t have to work anymore, I wanted to believe.“Maybe we rob it,” Atamanuik said, referring to the sheer mass of Trump’s public image. “Maybe like a binary star, we’re slowly pulling gas from that star. We’re building ours up, and maybe we’ll deplete that one.” He continued: “That was the idea for a long time: to be the anti-Trump, to be the exact opposite, but by embodying him.”It sounds like a fantasy, and it is. There can be no anti-Trump, no single star of competing mass; that may be the very phenomenon that won him the election. Atamanuik’s dream is the kind of Trumpian ambition that takes your own significance as given and works from there. Still, it is the wild idea that makes sense the morning after you shoot your show, having lunch in the restaurant where you used to work. That’s what you do when you get your big break: You imagine breaking bigger.', '', 'Abbie Hoffman Was No Donald Trump - The New York TimesTo the Editor:Re “The Abbie Hoffman of the Right,” by David Brooks (column, Sept. 26):Calling the late Abbie Hoffman a buffoon and comparing him to President Trump sullies the reputation of a 1960s activist who was a leader of a youth movement that changed the course of American history.Yes, Mr. Hoffman was a master of “political theater,” but he was no buffoon.

At its center is Rex Tillerson, who traded his job as top dog at the oil giant ExxonMobil to become secretary of state, only to find himself substantively and personally undercut by President Trump as recently as Sunday on the issue of Korea, where Mr. Tillerson wanted negotiations as Mr. Trump threatened war.On Wednesday, after NBC News reported that Mr. Tillerson was on the verge of resigning last summer, the secretary quickly called a news conference in which he asserted that he never considered doing so, though he did not personally deny a report that he had grown so disenchanted with the man in the Oval Office that he once called him a “moron” at a Pentagon meeting with the national security team and cabinet officials. Mr. Tillerson was said to be particularly upset by Mr. Trump’s highly politicized speech to the Boy Scouts of America, an organization the secretary once led. Various other Trump officials reportedly urged him to stay on at least until the end of the year, and Vice President Mike Pence counseled him on ways to ease tensions with the president.The conflicts are numerous and mounting. Last week, in Beijing, Mr. Tillerson described efforts to explore contacts with North Korea over the nuclear issue, only to have Mr. Trump scorn the initiative as a waste of time, leaving the impression that he was focused mainly on military options. In June, Mr. Tillerson called on Saudi Arabia and other gulf states to ease their blockade of Qatar, only to have Mr. Trump endorse the crackdown. The Trump administration has twice certified that Iran is complying with the terms of the nuclear deal that was one of former President Barack Obama’s major diplomatic achievements. Mr. Trump has left little doubt about his contempt for the deal.Domestic issues have also caused a wedge. Mr. Trump reportedly was furious when Mr. Tillerson distanced himself from the president’s disgraceful handling of the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Va., by saying the “president speaks for himself.”To say the least, all of this has made matters difficult for Mr. Tillerson, while confusing American foreign policy. Secretaries of state must be seen as having the president’s personal trust and the clout to represent him authoritatively all over the world. Mr. Trump’s behavior has only served to undermine Mr. Tillerson and raise doubts among world leaders about whether he represents the president’s true intentions. Some appointees would find such humiliation intolerable, or, like Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, would figure out how to disagree with and steer Mr. Trump without provoking his ire. Inexplicably, Mr. Tillerson seems to be ready to hang in, and Mr. Trump on Wednesday declared “total confidence” in him.Mr. Tillerson certainly has his weaknesses. He has often seemed detached and remote and has advocated severe budget cuts that are decimating the State Department and threatening its operations abroad. But those weaknesses are nothing compared to those of an inexperienced, self-absorbed, bombastic and impulsive president.', '', 'Pre-Trump vs. Post-Trump: How Americans Feel Now - The New York Times', 'Donald Trump Jr.’s Great Escape - The New York TimesOn the evening of Sept. 14, a man who looked an awful lot like Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the president of the United States, boarded Air Canada Jazz Flight AC 8889 in Vancouver, British Columbia. He made his way down the aisle of the Bombardier CRJ 900, found his seat, 17A, in the economy cabin, then settled in for the 923-mile flight to his final destination, Whitehorse, in Canada’s Yukon Territory. He was carrying a camouflage backpack, but he checked some other luggage at the beginning of his journey, two cities earlier, at New York’s LaGuardia Airport. That luggage consisted of a high-end hunting bow and a duffel bag. Hunting bows are dangerous weapons, and when you travel from the United States to Canada with a bow, you are supposed to retrieve it and whatever other luggage you are traveling with at your initial port of entry, then escort it through customs for inspection before continuing your journey. He had entered Canada in Toronto but failed to retrieve his bow and duffel bag there, which is why, a half-hour after his flight arrived in Whitehorse, when most of the other passengers had long since gotten their things and gone on their way, he was still milling around the baggage carousel, looking increasingly forlorn, as it appeared his luggage was not going to show up.I was supposed to be on that same flight from Vancouver to Whitehorse — I spend a lot of time in the Yukon and keep an apartment there — but I’d missed a connection, so I was still in Vancouver when a Whitehorse friend who happened to be at the airport that night called to let me know about an unexpected visitor.“Are you sure it’s him?”“Yes.”“What’s he wearing?”“I don’t know … outdoorsy gear. Gore-Tex. Khakis and boots. Baseball cap.”“Is he with anyone?”“Yeah … older guy, squat and short. And a young kid, maybe early 20s. Southern accents.”“Are they Secret Service?”She didn’t think they were. They didn’t fit the template, physically or behaviorally. The kid, for one thing, was really young and acted it. He just seemed super psyched to be there, she said. Also, no earpieces.I asked her to look around again, to try to spot the agents, because I figured if it was him, they had to be there somewhere. As far as I knew, the president’s immediate family all had Secret Service protection, at all times.“Maybe they’re parked outside?” I said.“They wouldn’t really be doing their job, then, would they?” she said.Doing their job has become a challenge for the Secret Service during the Trump administration. The president has a large family, one accustomed, like the president himself, to a lifestyle rich in air miles. While the weekly golfing trips of the commander in chief garner the bulk of the headlines, his grown children aren’t homebodies, either, and keeping them and their father safe has placed an unprecedented strain on the Secret Service. In May, Congress allocated an additional $34 million in funding for the agency, but it was soon exhausted; in late August, the Secret Service announced that unless more funds were issued, it would run out of money by the end of September. The Trump family, then, appears to have jet-setted themselves into a bind: The way they live is bankrupting the agency tasked with keeping them alive.Still, they wouldn’t abandon their protection altogether, would they?Eventually, my friend told me that the man had stopped pacing around the carousel and had wandered over to the Air Canada desk, where he was filing a report about his missing luggage. She heard him tell the people behind the counter that he planned to take a chartered floatplane to a remote hunting camp the next morning.I made it onto the next flight from Vancouver and a couple hours later watched out the window as we descended toward a small island of lights in a vast sea of darkness. The Yukon is huge and tiny. It’s got a landmass the size of France and a population — 33,897 — that’s barely one-hundredth the size of Paris’s. Most of that population is in Whitehorse, leaving the bulk of the territory uninhabited, a subarctic landscape of tundra and mountains stretching north toward the pole.The area often evokes romantic images of Jack London and the Klondike Gold Rush. Donald Trump Jr.’s German great-grandfather, Friedrich Trump, actually lived here for a while during the Rush. He opened a saloon on Main Street in Whitehorse — one that may have doubled as a brothel — and ran it for a few years, catering to the boom-and-bust desires of gold-panners. Then he sold his share and eventually made his way to the United States, where he decided to start investing in real estate. Large- and small-scale miners are still drawn to the Yukon, but these days when Americans come here they’re often in pursuit of a different natural resource. The territory hosts a cornucopia of wild game — there are at least twice as many moose as humans here, for example — making it a hunter’s paradise.Donald Trump Jr. is an avid hunter. The internet is full of grisly pictures of him posing with the corpses of elephants, leopards, water buffaloes, crocodiles. That he might come here on a hunting trip wasn’t surprising. But it surprised me that he had traveled on a commercial flight — economy class, no less. I wondered whether my friend at the airport had been mistaken. The president’s son is the sort of generically handsome guy that might have more than a few look-alikes.Over the next couple of days, I occasionally checked news stories online but didn’t find even the whiff of a Yukon trip. Trump’s social media accounts had gone suspiciously quiet, though. The morning after his supposed arrival in Whitehorse, he tweeted the following: “Protip: If have to tell others you’re an alpha … you’re not,” but after that his usually active feed became just a sporadic drizzle of retweets.Then on Sept. 18, The New York Times ran an article with the following headline: “Donald Trump Jr. Gives Up Secret Service Protection, Seeking Privacy.” The article explained that a few days earlier, Trump voluntarily abandoned his security detail. The reporters had reached out to Trump for comment, but hadn’t been able to locate him. Apparently they didn’t know where he was. That vacuum of knowledge was soon filled with speculation in other outlets about how Trump’s surprise move might mesh with the all-consuming scandals hanging over his father’s administration. GQ ruminated about how “suspicious” it was for “a major adviser to and son of the president who is the subject of a serious investigation into possible international espionage to get rid of the government agents who are around him all the time.” A British paper echoed that theme, running a piece with a headline noting that Trump was “conspicuously absent” during the president’s speech at the United Nations.But I was now confident that I knew where he was — give or take a couple hundred thousand square miles — and that it was nowhere near Moscow. Instead, the son of the president was traveling on the down low in a remote wilderness, without Secret Service. And that seemed significant, regardless of your politics, or your investment in the Russia scandal. After all, one reason you want to protect the president’s family members is to prevent them from being abducted, a nightmare scenario that would put the president, and the whole country, in an awful position. I mean, a whole story arc on “The West Wing” hinged on basically that exact premise. (Incidentally, after Zoey was abducted, President Bartlet temporarily abdicated office by invoking the same amendment — the 25th — that some people hope might eventually push Trump out the door.) Whatever your politics, whatever you think of Trump, the last thing you would want is for his son to fall into the wrong hands. Meaning that if Trump Jr. had decided to give up his Secret Service protection, at the very least you would hope he wouldn’t be easy to find.I decided to see if I could track him down.A lot of people in the Yukon work multiple jobs. A good friend of mine, for example, is a writer/rock musician/actress/dog-musher. She also occasionally hires on as a guide or a cook with the big-game outfitters that cater to wealthy out-of-towners like, say, Donald Trump Jr. There are 19 big-game outfitters in the Yukon — each with their own huge hunting concession — and their clients pay about the price of a Honda Accord to spend a week in the bush killing wolves, moose, bears, elk and whatever other Yukon fauna they most covet. The outfitters charge a base fee for the trip — often about $20,000 for 10 days at a bush camp — then tack on additional fees based on the kill. Shooting a wolf is the cheapest — about $100 a head — while more prestigious kills can go for a hundred times that amount. Clients often pay a bonus of $10,000 or more for the privilege of killing a sheep.I told my friend about Trump Jr.’s trip, and asked her to help me narrow down his location. She got in touch with some acquaintances in the outfitting business. They told her some things. Pretty soon I was pretty sure I knew roughly where he was. Besides his location, I even had a good idea of what he was hunting: According to one of my friend’s sources, he had supposedly been spending time on a river, which meant he was probably trying to bag a moose.Then I froze.In other circumstances, looking for another person, I might have aggressively called all the likeliest outfitters and tried to talk my way into their camps. This was different. It occurred to me that my questions might trigger an unpredictable series of events. If Trump realized that his under-the-radar trip was no longer under the radar, he or someone else might decide that he had to be yanked out of the bush, for safety’s sake. He’d spook, in other words. Which would inevitably lead to bubble-reinforcing headlines that might contain at least a grain of truth: “Reporter Endangers Trump Son (and Ruins His Vacation).”The Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport is named after a former member of Parliament who, legend has it, won his seat in part by promising the local population that if they voted for him he’d lift the territory’s then-stringent restrictions on alcohol. He won in a landslide, and the airport is one part of his legacy, as is, perhaps, Canada’s highest per-capita drinking rates. There are only a handful of commercial flights to and from Whitehorse every day, and in between flights the airport is dead. I arrived around 6 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 22, and hunkered down in the empty departures hall, waiting for Trump. I had reason to believe that he finished his hunt and was going to take the 9:10 p.m. flight to Vancouver, the beginning of his three-leg trip back to New York. I was on the phone with a friend, complaining that I felt like paparazzo, when I spotted him.Baseball cap, red checkered shirt, week’s worth of stubble, khaki pants, camouflage backpack, sturdy shoes and a long black carrying case presumably containing a hunting bow. He walked past me, all alone, and stopped in front of a door to the side of the main security entrance, a door you use when you’re checking either unusually bulky items or weapons. He started ringing the buzzer beside the door. Nobody answered. I got up and walked over.“Hey,” I said. “I’m Luke.”I held out my hand, and he shook it.“I’m Don,” he said.I told him that I heard he was in the area, that I was with The New York Times Magazine and that I’d love to talk to him about his trip.“The Times,” he said. “I never know where you guys are coming from.”I asked if he bagged anything.“I can’t really tell you that,” he said. ‘‘Let’s just say it was a good hunt.’’Was it a moose?“I can’t … look, I can’t say.”(It was a moose. Big one, too.)He politely nonanswered a few more questions. We went off the record and chatted a while longer, focusing on his decision to drop his security detail. He had at least an hour before boarding and said he was hungry and was going to go eat with some of his hunting buddies, who had by now joined us in the security line. I told him that I’d hang around till he got back and that I hoped he’d reconsider talking with me on the record. He left, and I waited. By the time he returned, the airport had filled with people. There was a family going to Disneyland, each of their five children wearing a Mickey Mouse hat. There was a man hauling a cooler full of moose meat. And there were guns. Lots and lots of guns, long-muzzled and high-velocity, carted through the terminal by a motley crew of hunters. It was that time of year.I walked back up to the eldest son of the most powerful man in the world. At that moment, it seemed to me that he had put himself in an unwisely vulnerable position. I asked again if we could talk. He said no. I asked if I could take a picture at least.Then I bagged a selfie and went home.', 'Donald Trump Takes a Hostage - The New York TimesNegotiators warn never to take a hostage you can’t shoot. By announcing Friday that the administration would not certify that the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran was in the national interest, Donald Trump has taken a hostage.The hostage is the deal itself. Contrary to belief, decertification neither violates nor cancels the agreement. It does not betray our commitments to our allies and it does not abrogate our obligations to the Iranians. It’s an act of domestic politics between two branches of the United States government.But it’s also a psychological step, a brash signal that Trump is prepared to see the deal fail and accept the consequences, including war, if he can’t negotiate a better one. Since Iran insists it won’t budge, it sets Washington and Tehran on a path of confrontation that can be averted only if one side or the other blinks. Decertification is Trump saying: We won’t blink.On Thursday, a well-placed source who advises the administration on Iran policy and supports decertification listed for me all the ways things could go wrong.There’s personnel risk, starting with the volatility of the man at the top.There’s escalatory risk, as the United States, its forces thinly stretched in the Middle East, become vulnerable to attack by Iran’s terrorist proxies. Think of the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut in 1983 and the humiliating American withdrawal in its wake.There’s diplomatic risk, as Iran traps Western diplomats in a process of never-ending negotiations designed to go nowhere — all the while turning the Islamic Republic into a reputable member of the international community and the United States into the global pariah.Above all, there’s the risk that Iran will call Trump’s bluff, much as Bashar al-Assad called President Obama’s when he failed to enforce his chemical red line in 2013. A superpower repeatedly exposed as a paper tiger by lesser, if more willful, adversaries will not maintain its pre-eminence for long.So what’s the case for supporting decertification?The architects of the nuclear deal make three dubious claims on its behalf. They say it concerns Iran’s nuclear dossier alone, and does not prevent us from thwarting Tehran’s regional bids in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza or the Gulf. They claim the deal is working because Iran is abiding by its terms, as certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.And they add that since the agreement permanently enjoins the Iranians from acquiring nuclear weapons, the United States maintains the military option to stop them from doing so.Yet Iran’s regional behavior has become worse since the nuclear deal came into effect, not least because it provided the regime with a huge new income stream — $10 billion in cash and gold in 2016 alone, plus more than $100 billion in additional sanctions relief — to fund its work. Tehran also operates on the assumption, well justified during the Obama years, that the United States would not risk the nuclear deal for the sake of rolling back Iranian gains in Syria and elsewhere.As for the point that the Iranians are generally (if not quite entirely) honoring their end of the bargain — why shouldn’t they? “Iran doesn’t want a bomb today,” one senior Israeli official told me. “It wants a bomb tomorrow.” That is, it wants a robust nuclear base that puts it within a screw’s twist of a sizable nuclear arsenal without the economic and security risks of actual possession.And if it does choose to go for a bomb once the agreement has run its course, our military options will be slight. If we couldn’t prevent Pakistan or North Korea from going nuclear in the 1990s, why should we think we’ll be able to stop Iran in the nick of time?My critics will claim that a distant prospect of a nuclear Iran is still vastly preferable to an exit from the deal that allows Iran to bring its centrifuges out of storage and start spinning its way to a bomb once again, this time without the monitoring of United Nations inspectors.Maybe. But Iran still wants the economic benefits of the deal — benefits Washington alone can bestow through waivers, permits, relief from secondary sanctions and control over dollar transactions. The American Goliath needn’t be helpless against a Middle Eastern state with a gross domestic product only slightly larger than that of metropolitan Atlanta.We are living through a nuclear nightmare on the Korean Peninsula after more than two decades of optimistic diplomacy. That’s a fate we ought to do everything possible to avoid with Iran. As Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies points out, “decertification isn’t a sufficient condition to break the paralysis of our Iran policy, but it is a necessary one.”Even if the rest of the difficult enterprise rests in the hands of — God help us — President Trump.', 'Donald Trump, Democratic Party, AT&T: Your Thursday Briefing - The New York Times (Want to get this briefing by email?

(It’s a “Frankenpastry” hybrid of a croissant and a doughnut.)But the croissant, it turns out, was always a hybrid. According to local lore and the “Larousse Gastronomique,” it was created in Budapest in 1686, or Vienna in 1683, to celebrate the defeat of the Ottomans, and was later adopted by the French. The crescent shape, the story goes, was inspired by the Ottoman flag.We asked the head of our Cooking department, Sam Sifton, for a recipe — but it turns out we’re still working on one. “We haven’t yet developed one that’s really, truly accessible to the home cook,” he told us. “Croissants are hard!”Here’s his advice: “We find the best ones we can at the bakery, eat a few and let the rest go a little stale, so we can use them in Melissa Clark’s incredible recipe for a buttery breakfast casserole. It may be the highest use of a croissant in the world.”Karen Zraick contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning.

Donald Trump Jr. spoke at an annual fundraising gala at Faulkner University, a private Christian college in Alabama.He stood behind the president’s comment that “both sides” were to blame for violence in Charlottesville that led to the death of one counter-protesting woman and left multiple people injured.“He condemned ... the white nationalists and the left-wingers," Trump Jr. said during a 35-minute speech. "That should not have been controversial, but it was."Donald Trump Jr. speaks at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio U.S. July 19, 2016.(Reuters)In blaming liberals, Trump Jr. pointed out examples of left-wing violence, including the far-left militants calling themselves “Antifa,” who have been linked to vandalism and other disruption in Berkeley, Calif.He also referred to James Hodgkinson, the suspect who allegedly shot Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., in June at a baseball practice in Virginia. The suspect is said to have been a Bernie Sanders supporter.“He went out looking for Republicans to kill and we\'re supposed to forget that," Trump Jr. said.Trump’s eldest son then moved on to mock the politically-correct university campus culture, sparking applause after saying students are being taught to “hate their country” and “hate their religion” all while conservative voices are being silenced.He decried the creation of “Marxists” and “social justice warriors,” making you “less educated than when you started” at the university. "Everyone to the right of them is Hitler," he added."Today\'s conservative speech is violence. Unprovoked liberal violence is self-defense.""Today\'s conservative speech is violence. Unprovoked liberal violence is self-defense," Trump Jr. said, pointing out that conservatives are often denied speaking opportunities or their appearances are met with protests."Words have lost their meanings,” he added. “\'Hate speech\' is that America is a good country ... that we need borders ... anything that comes out of the mouth of the president ... the moral teaching of the Bible.”The speech ended with an attack on universities’ efforts to foster diversity, mocking the concept of “safe spaces” for women, LGBT students or minorities.The college has confirmed that Trump Jr. was paid for the speaking engagement but declined to disclose the sum. Trump Jr.\'s speaking agency, which books his appearances, says on its website that the president\'s son\'s fee is typically “$50,001 and above.”The Associated Press contributed to this report.Lukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Trump said he didn\'t know that it was customary to wait to meet other leaders until after you take office, and he told Abe he\'d be happy to meet with him "any time."The president said that when he tried to delay, Abe was already on a plane to New York, "so I had to see him." Trump said they had a great meeting and Abe "brought me the most beautiful golf club I\'ve ever seen."Trump says he enjoyed "every minute" of his visit to Japan — the first stop on a five-country Asian tour.___6 p.m.President Donald Trump is ratcheting up the pressure on North Korea, refusing to rule out eventual military action and declaring that the United States "will not stand" for Pyongyang menacing America or its Asian allies.Trump, on the first stop of his lengthy Asia trip, is denouncing North Korea Monday as "a threat to the civilized world."He exhorted dictator Kim Jong Un to cease weapons testing like the missiles he has fired over Japanese territory in recent weeks.Trump did not modulate his fiery language on North Korea, declaring that Pyongyang imperiled "international peace and stability."Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed with Trump\'s assessment that "all options are on the table."', '', 'Anniversary of the Apocalypse - The New York TimesIn the terror-struck and vertiginous days after Donald Trump’s election a year ago, as I tried to make sense of America’s new reality, I called people who lived, or had lived, under authoritarianism to ask what to expect. I wasn’t looking for concrete predictions — one of the disorienting things about that moment was that no one, no matter how learned, had any idea what was happening — but for insights into how the texture of life changes when an autocratic demagogue is in charge.A secular Turkish journalist told me, her voice sad and weary, that while people might at first pour into the streets to oppose Trump, eventually the protests would probably die out as a sense of stunned emergency gave way to the slog of sustained opposition. The Russian dissident writer Masha Gessen warned that there’s no way, with a leader who lays siege to the fabric of reality, to fully hold on to a sense of what’s normal. “You drift, and you get warped,” she told me.They were both right. The country has changed in the past year, and many of us have grown numb after unrelenting shocks. What now passes for ordinary would have once been inconceivable. The government is under the control of an erratic racist who engages in nuclear brinkmanship on Twitter. He is dismantling the State Department, defending the hollowing out of the diplomatic corps by saying, on Fox News, “I’m the only one that matters.”He publicly pressures the Justice Department to investigate his political opponents. He’s called for reporters to be jailed, and his administration demanded that a sportscaster who criticized him be fired. Official government statements promote his hotels. You can’t protest it all; you’d never do anything else. After the election, many liberals pledged not to “normalize” Trump. But one lesson of this year is that we don’t get to decide what normal looks like.Last month Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, took an unannounced trip to Saudi Arabia, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later had a number of his rivals, including a Trump critic, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, put under arrest. In The Washington Post, David Ignatius described Kushner’s talks with Prince Mohammed this way: “The two princes are said to have stayed up until nearly 4 a.m. several nights, swapping stories and planning strategy.” A year ago, that sentence would have been unintelligible as a description of American diplomacy, even as a wry joke.But this nightmare year has upended assumptions about the durability of the rules, formal and informal, governing our politics. There’s a metaphysical whiplash in how quickly alarm turns into acceptance and then into forgetfulness. It was astonishing when Trump installed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist, a man who had previously run a white nationalist tabloid; now it feels like ages ago that he was even in the White House. (He’s been gone less than three months.)It was staggering when credible evidence emerged that one of the president’s former national security advisers, Sebastian Gorka, was a member of a Nazi-aligned Hungarian group called the Vitezi Rend, and even more staggering when that revelation didn’t immediately end his White House career.Hannah Arendt once wrote of the role vulgarity played in undermining liberalism in pre-totalitarian societies: “The temporary alliance between the elite and the mob rested largely on this genuine delight with which the former watched the latter destroy respectability.” I thought of this when I saw Ted Nugent, who on several occasions called for Barack Obama to be killed, grinning in a photograph taken in the Oval Office, or Kellyanne Conway appearing on television to urge America to buy Ivanka Trump merchandise. In this administration, crassness has become a weapon, annihilating social codes that once restrained political behavior, signaling that old standards no longer apply.Lately, the pace of shocks has picked up, even if our capacity to process them has not. Trump’s former campaign chairman has been indicted. One of his former foreign policy aides has pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his attempts to collude with Russia. His commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, turns out to have retained a stake in a company with business ties to the son-in-law of President Vladimir Putin of Russia.The new head of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Science Advisory Board once claimed that our air is “too clean for optimum health.” USA Today recently reported that the president has nominated several members of his clubs to federal jobs. Never in modern history, it said, “has a president awarded government posts to people who pay money to his own companies.” In another administration this would have been a major scandal. In this one it barely registers.How can America ever return from this level of systematic derangement and corruption? I wish there was someone I could ask, but we know more about how countries slide into autocracy than how they might climb out of it. It’s been a year, and sometimes I’m still poleaxed by grief at the destruction of our civic inheritance.In moments of optimism I think that this is just a hideous interregnum, and that in a brighter future we’ll watch prestige dramas about the time we almost lost America while members of the current regime grow old in prison. But in my head I hear the song that closed out Trump rallies like a satanic taunt or an epitaph for democracy: “You can’t always get what you want.”', '', 'N.R.A. and G.O.P., Together Forever - The New York TimesFOR years, Republicans have effectively outsourced their thought leadership to the loudmouths at the end of the bar. But perhaps the most extreme example of that trend has been the issue of guns, where the party has ceded control to a gun lobby that has built its brand on absolutism.And now, again, we are about to see the consequences of that abdication. Congress did nothing in the wake of the mass murder of children at Sandy Hook, and except for a largely symbolic ban on bump stocks, it’s likely that nothing meaningful will happen in the aftermath of the shootings in Las Vegas. Instead, Republicans will round up all the usual clichés and excuses for inaction.We’ve seen this before, and it is a script written by the National Rifle Association. The N.R.A.’s blessing of restrictions on bump stocks — devices that make semiautomatic weapons fire faster — is designed to pre-empt anything more serious by giving the illusion of action. It substitutes accessory control for actual gun control.I saw firsthand how the N.R.A. worked six years ago when I was a conservative radio talk show host in Wisconsin. The context is important here: I was a longtime supporter of Second Amendment rights and had backed state legislation that would allow law-abiding citizens who passed training courses and background checks to carry concealed weapons (as every state now allows in some form). More than 16 million Americans have the permits.In 2011, concealed-carry legislation was poised to pass both houses of the Wisconsin Legislature until the N.R.A. decided that it did not go far enough. It insisted that the Second Amendment should preclude even minimal safety requirements for concealed carry. The N.R.A., claiming that it was supporting what it calls “constitutional carry,” demanded that anyone be allowed to carry a concealed handgun without training, background checks or permits of any kind.I thought this was nuts and said so. The N.R.A. position made no sense from the standpoint of either public safety or politics. How would an unlimited right to carry weapons enhance public safety or confidence if you could walk into Milwaukee’s Miller Park with a handgun without any training or a permit? That would be a nightmare for law enforcement and frankly unsettling even for many ardent Second Amendment supporters.But the national gun rights lobby pushed back hard, targeting me and a radio colleague who thought the idea defied common sense. The headline on one pro-gun website declared, “N.R.A. Calls Out Milwaukee Talk Show Hosts for Ignorant Stance on Right to Carry.”Darren LaSorte, a former lobbyist for the N.R.A. Institute for Legislative Action, appeared on an internet broadcast, insisting that “it’s embarrassing to see them do that.” By suggesting that people learn to use a gun before carrying it out in public, he said, my colleague and I “probably did more harm to constitutional carry and the fight there than any other people out there, the anti-gunners or anyone else.”N.R.A. members, he said, “should be actively hammering them.” Many of them did so, as my email overflowed with angry gun-rights activists demanding unfettered concealed carry. But when I opened up the phones to listeners, the response was quite different. As polls suggest, most gun owners take a far more reasonable stance than the gun lobby. My listeners overwhelmingly supported gun rights but thought that requirements for background checks, safety training and permits just made sense.Despite a costly campaign that flooded legislators with emails and calls, the N.R.A. lost its bid for “constitutional carry” in Wisconsin. But the organization is back again this year, pushing ahead with a new effort to eliminate the licensing and training requirements for concealed carry here and elsewhere. And the N.R.A. remains on the offensive: 12 states allow concealed carry without a permit.Since we beat the N.R.A. back six years ago, the political environment on guns has shifted quite a bit. President Trump seems to understand not only that the gun issue helped him win states like Michigan and Wisconsin but also that opposition to gun control has now become a central test of loyalty in our tribal politics.This is what many of the N.R.A.’s critics have been slow to grasp: The N.R.A. has successfully taken the issue of rational gun regulation out of the policy realm and made it a central feature of the culture wars. The issue is no longer simply about bump stock, or assault weapons, or specific regulations, or public safety; the debate over guns has become a subset of the larger cultural clash that pits us against them — liberals versus “normal” Americans. As Kurt Schlichter, a conservative columnist, insisted last week, “Leftists hate our rights because they hate us.”The N.R.A. has pursued that strategy relentlessly and with great effect. It was hardly a coincidence that it decided to wade into the controversy over N.F.L. players’ kneeling during the playing of the national anthem. The group put out a video called “We Stand,” which linked the themes of freedom, patriotism and guns. “I stand for the children, the spouses and parents whose family made the ultimate sacrifice for us,” the narrator says. “We are all standing. We are the National Rifle Association of America and we are freedom’s safest place.”In a recent video starring Dana Loesch, a popular radio talk show host, the N.R.A. checked all the boxes of the culture wars. Featuring apocalyptic images of protests and violence, the spot targeted educational indoctrination in the schools, Hollywood leftism and liberal news media bias. “The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth,” Ms. Loesch declares.The video was part of a larger strategy. Last fall, the N.R.A. started its own television news outlet, known as NRATV. As Adam Winkler, a law professor at U.C.L.A. and the author of “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,” notes, NRATV does not focus merely on guns. “Now it’s focused on immigration, race, health care,” he told The New Republic. “We’re seeing the N.R.A. become an extreme right-wing media outlet, not just a protector of guns.”It’s actually more than that. The N.R.A. has effectively turned itself into the Id of the right. Despite the largely symbolic ban on bump stocks, the result is paralysis, both political and moral.There was a time when the Republican Party could discuss possible reforms to our gun laws: Ronald Reagan himself endorsed the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban that passed in 1994. But today, no matter how horrified decent Republicans are by the carnage, they understand that any meaningful response is now impossible. In the face of unconscionable bloodshed, the party is forced again to argue that there is really no public policy response regarding guns, that there is nothing they can do, besides a largely tactical retreat that will allow the cycle of carnage and cowardice to repeat itself.', 'Donald Trump Wants to Raise Your Taxes - The New York TimesThe old formula for passing a big tax cut for the rich was simple: Package it with a modest tax cut for the middle class — and talk endlessly about the middle-class part.President Trump and Congress are following the formula in some ways. Their plan would deliver an average tax cut of $700,000 to the nation’s 175,000 richest families. That’s enough for each to buy a new 50-foot yacht, annually. Meanwhile, Trump and other Republican leaders keep repeating “middle class,” “middle class,” “middle class.”Yet there is also a major difference between the current plan and George W. Bush’s tax cut or Ronald Reagan’s. Trump’s plan would not actually cut taxes for many middle-class families. It would raise them.These families are in the minority, yes. But there are a lot of them. About 17 percent of households earning between $50,000 and $150,000 would see their taxes rise immediately, according to the only rigorous analysis so far, by the Tax Policy Center. Among households earning between $150,000 and $250,000, the share is about 35 percent.These numbers would grow over time, for reasons I’ll explain. Ultimately, the plan would be likely to hurt the finances of the vast majority of Americans. No wonder it is starting to look politically vulnerable. Last week, a precursor bill barely passed the House, receiving 20 no votes from Republicans, many worried about the tax increases.Republican leaders certainly have a path to passing a tax bill, because nothing unites modern Republicans the way a tax cut does. But the opposition to the recent health care bills also started as an underdog and managed to prevail, by relentlessly talking about the bills’ effects. When enough Americans understood the truth, enough members of Congress felt pressure to vote no.The same could happen on taxes. It is already starting to. Recent polls suggest the plan’s approval rating is only about 30 percent.To understand the Trump tax increases, you should first acknowledge the most admirable feature of his plan. It doesn’t aspire to be merely a tax cut. It aspires to be tax reform — both cuts and increases. Some deductions shrink, while rates fall, in the name of simplifying the tax code.But after this promising start, the plan commits its cardinal sin. It places the highest priority on huge tax cuts for the very wealthy. They get lower rates and get to keep cherished tax breaks, like the “carried interest” loophole. Herbert Hoover’s Republican Party wanted to put a chicken in every pot. Donald Trump’s wants to put a yacht at every private dock.Having lavished so much money on the wealthy, the tax package — or at least the vague framework that the administration has released — doesn’t have much remaining to spend on middle class and poor families. For them, the package is a mix of pluses and minuses. Many face a lower tax rate, but some face a higher one, and many families lose deductions.The combination creates a lot of losers. Reduced deductions for children, for example, hurt large families, notes N.Y.U.’s Lily Batchelder. And the deduction for state and local taxes — also a target for cuts — now benefits 30 percent of households nationwide. It was the main reason for last week’s House defections, and the tensions over it haven’t been resolved.Then there are the long-term problems I mentioned earlier. First, Trump’s plan takes a skimpy approach to inflation adjustments, which will push many families into higher tax brackets over time. Second, the plan would radically increase the federal deficit, and when it comes to the deficit, what goes up must eventually come down. At some point, the government will need to pay its bills, through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts.Virtually any future deficit-reduction plan — except for a repeal of the Trump tax plan — would hurt most families more than his plan helps them. This chain of events has happened before. The Reagan and George W. Bush tax cuts may have at first seemed to help the middle class and poor. But the deficits led to later cuts in education, medical research, transportation and anti-poverty programs that almost surely erased the benefits of a modest tax cut. Already, today’s congressional leaders are talking about sizable cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.Trump and his allies are feverishly trying to claim their plan really would benefit the middle class. Their latest talking point is the notion that corporate tax cuts will create an indirect windfall for workers. Funny, though, how the wealthy get most of the direct benefits, while everyone else has to hope for indirect ones somehow to materialize.The main lesson of this year’s health care battle was the political power of facts. They don’t always win the day, but it’s better to have them as an ally than an enemy. Right now, facts are the biggest problem for Trump’s tax plan.', 'TOKYO – The Latest on President Donald Trump trip to Asia (all times local):9:45 a.m.President Donald Trump says he is looking forward to his arrival in Japan.Trump is tweeting Sunday about his trip through Asia, which starts in Japan.

Sunday marks the day it closed in 1954.Many Americans are descended from immigrants who first arrived at Ellis Island in a wave of immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries.Upon arrival by ship, steerage passengers were transported to the island for inspections. (First- and second-class passengers skipped that step.)Those found to have serious contagious illnesses or deemed unemployable could face deportation.Nearly 70 percent of arrivals didn’t speak a word of English, but language was never an issue, said Doug Treem, a National Park Service Ranger.Interpreters translated scores of languages. To qualify, each had to be conversational in four languages other than English. Many were immigrants or children of immigrants.“I doubt if anyone working as a translator at the U.N. right now could have gotten a job at Ellis Island,” said Mr. Treem.One translator, the child of European immigrants and a veteran of the U.S. Foreign Service, worked in Italian, German, Yiddish and Croatian, while attending law school at night. That was Fiorello LaGuardia, who later became a three-term mayor of New York City.Sara Aridi contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.This briefing was prepared for the European morning.

We’re keeping a close eye on the baffling, fast-moving developments in the Middle East that are fueling anxieties about a possible military conflict in Lebanon. Above, a poster of a key player — Lebanon’s prime minister, who is missing — being put up in Beirut.The full rundown is here. In short form: The impulsive young Saudi crown prince had more than 200 royal relatives and businessmen arrested, consolidating power and then sharply escalating a proxy war with Iran that threatens millions of people in Yemen with starvation.As speculation built that the kingdom could be holding the Lebanese prime minister hostage, the leader of the Shiite militia Hezbollah, an Iranian ally, said the Saudis had asked Israel to attack Lebanon. At least four countries have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon. And the Saudis would play a major role in “the ultimate deal” President Trump’s advisers are working on for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.____2. In Asia, President Trump is nearing the end of his lengthy trip with less discipline than he started it. Notably, he sought to woo the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, with flattery, but came away with no significant concessions on North Korea or looming trade disputes. Above, the Trumps at the Forbidden City in Beijing.Mr. Trump pressed his case for “America first” trade policies at a regional forum in Vietnam, striking a jarring note before leaders who had supported the Obama administration’s efforts to close the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. His comments also sharply contrasted with Mr. Xi’s projection of cooperation and engagement minutes later on the same stage.Our photographer has been traveling with Mr. Trump, documenting each stop on the 12-day trip. The president returns to the U.S. from Manila on Tuesday.____3. Upon his return, President Trump will find a Republican Party in disarray. A year after his election, anger against him helped fuel strong Democratic turnout in the suburbs and a rising coalition of women, minorities, and gay and transgender people that gave Democrats groundbreaking wins across the country.And Republican senators are exploring ways to stymie the candidacy of Roy Moore for a Senate seat in Alabama after the emergence of allegations that he made sexual advances on teenagers when he was in his 30s. Mr. Moore has denied any sexual misconduct and is moving to discredit the women who came forward.The accusations are distracting from Senate Republicans’ newly unveiled tax plan, which diverges from the evolving House bill in key ways. Both, however, would raise taxes for millions of middle-class families.____4. “These stories are true.” The comedian Louis C.K. confirmed the accounts of five women in his field accusing him of asking them to watch him masturbate.He is one of  least 20 men to have been accused of sexual misconduct since we reported on allegations of harassment and worse against Harvey Weinstein last month. As with Kevin Spacey and others, Louis C. K.’s media partners are severing ties.Our writer Amanda Hess argues that it’s time to do away with the notion that artists and their work must be considered independently.____5. Funerals have begun for victims of the shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex. The small town’s cemetery is struggling to figure out how to manage burials for the more than two dozen victims of Devin Kelley’s killing spree.The former airman’s court-martial and conviction on charges of assaulting his first wife and his toddler stepson should have prevented him from legally buying weapons. Air Force authorities are investigating why the information wasn’t entered into the federal database for firearms background checks. “He was just problem after problem after problem,” said a former Air Force staff sergeant who said that years ago, she feared he would “shoot up the place.”One of our most-read articles this week was an Interpreter column that examined mass shootings around the world and found an explanation for the extraordinary prevalence of mass shootings in America. (It’s not likely to surprise you.)____6. “He said he didn’t meddle — I asked him again.” President Trump told reporters that he believed Vladimir Putin was sincere in his repeated denials of involvement in the U.S. election last year.The Russian president’s account is squarely at odds with the U.S. intelligence agencies, whose assessments Mr. Trump did not dispute on Sunday. The comments came as new information has emerged about a 2016 meeting at which Joseph Mifsud, above left, a Maltese professor, told the Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos of “thousands of emails” that could be used against Hillary Clinton.____7. Writing for the Vows column, our arms and conflict reporter C.J. Chivers revisits the story of a former Marine rifleman with post-traumatic stress disorder and the woman who has loved him since childhood, above. Mr. Chivers’s profile of the Marine, Sam Siatta, earned a Pulitzer Prize this spring.And our Modern Love column began 13 years ago. We’re celebrating the milestone by following up on a few of the most resonant essays and sharing 13-word love stories from readers (“I thought I was straight. She thought she was straight. We were wrong.”).____8. Our reporters dived deep into the Paradise Papers, a 13.4-million-document leak that illuminates how trillions of dollars move through offshore tax shelters.Much of the information focuses on a law firm in Bermuda, whose offices are pictured above, that has helped wealthy clients including Madonna, Bono and Queen Elizabeth II invest, and that has helped major U.S. colleges skirt taxes on their endowments.____9. We checked in on hurricane recovery.In Houston, pictured above in mid-October, much of the devastation was a direct result of a quintessentially American defiance of nature’s boundaries. The latest installment in our immersive Changing Climate, Changing Cities series focuses on what rebuilding in that coastal city says about diverging attitudes toward, among other things, race, liberty and science.In Puerto Rico, figures show that 472 more people died in September compared with the same month last year, a sharp contrast with the official storm death toll of 55. And in parts of the U.S. Virgin Islands, day-to-day survival continues to be a struggle.The governors of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands will testify before a Senate committee on hurricane recovery on Tuesday.____10. On “Saturday Night Live,” there was no shortage of targets amid the growing number of accusations of sexual misconduct by prominent men, including Louis C.K. and Roy Moore (played by Mikey Day, above left).But on the episode, hosted by the “Girls Trip” star Tiffany Haddish and featuring the musical guest Taylor Swift, some of the accused got rougher treatment than others.____11. Finally, it’s time to talk turkey.Thanksgiving is less than two weeks away. If you haven’t started planning, don’t panic.Our Food section walks you through a “400-Degree Thanksgiving” (one oven, four burners and a single day of work) with vivid video guidance.

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.Here’s what you need to know:• The tax overhaul that has moved through Congress with scant debate includes measures that are straight from the Republican playbook. It would also affect issues barely connected to taxation, such as Medicare, education and granting rights to “unborn children.”The plan’s guiding philosophy is trickle-down economics, whose benefits have historically been monopolized by the wealthy, our correspondents write. Pay for most American workers has been stagnant since the mid-1970s.On Wednesday, President Trump said the $1.5 trillion package of cuts was aimed at the middle class and would not help wealthy people like him. (We assessed some of his claims.)• Significant changes were still being discussed in the Senate, which is on track for a final vote this week. Our live briefing has the latest.• The White House has developed a plan to force out Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, whose relationship with President Trump has been strained, senior administration officials said today.Mr. Tillerson would be replaced by Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, within the next several weeks.• It was not immediately clear whether the president had given final approval to the plan, but he is said to have soured on Mr. Tillerson and to be ready to make a change at the State Department.• A growing number of big names in broadcasting have been accused of a range of sexual misconduct, and the networks now face questions about why the behavior went unaddressed for so long, our media columnist, Jim Rutenberg, writes.He also noted the different responses to the cascade of accusations, comparing how figures in the news media and Hollywood have lost their jobs while politicians remain employed.This morning, Matt Lauer expressed “sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused,” a day after NBC fired the longtime “Today” co-host over multiple allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. Our TV critics discussed the revelations.The Times has started a new newsletter, The #MeToo Moment, in which our gender editor, Jessica Bennett, will offer updates and analysis on the wave of revelations about sexual misconduct. Sign up here.• Separately, Minnesota Public Radio said it was cutting all ties with Garrison Keillor, the creator of “A Prairie Home Companion,” after allegations of “inappropriate behavior.”• Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain denounced President Trump on Wednesday after he shared videos from a fringe ultranationalist group purportedly showing Muslims committing acts of violence.We examined the videos. At least one misrepresents the facts of what the viewer is seeing, while two others are provided without any context.• Britain First, the group that posted the videos, thanked Mr. Trump for publicizing its views, which include the idea that white Christian civilization is under threat from Muslims.• In postwar Japan, a single-minded focus on rapid economic growth helped erode family ties. Now, a generation is dying alone.The extreme isolation of elderly Japanese is so common that an entire industry has emerged, specializing in cleaning out apartments where decomposing remains are found.• “The way we die is a mirror of the way we live,” one 83-year-old said.Listen on a computer, an iOS device or an Android device.• Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, gave Congress an upbeat assessment of the economy on Wednesday, and said she expected growth to continue.• G.M. is set to demonstrate its growing fleet of self-driving Chevrolet Bolts today.• American Airlines is scrambling to fix an error that left about 15,000 scheduled holiday flights without pilots.• U.S. stocks were mixed on Wednesday.

Simpson, the state of rap and his place in music.“I’m the person that looked at the Mona Lisa and be like, man, that’s gonna be cool in 40 years,” Jay-Z said. “I play forever. And so my whole thing is to identify with the truth. Not to be the youngest, hottest, new, trendy thing.”Watch the interview here.• Nazi sympathizer loses his job.The restaurant in Ohio that employed Tony Hovater, the subject of a recent Times profile who expressed a belief that races are better off separate, said it had received threats.• An uplifting tale from London. After years of drifting the city’s canals, a step ahead of the law, two English students-turned-squatters found success in their 50s with a floating bookstore.“Books have been considered on the verge of obsolete, and so have canals,” one of the owners said. “But these are things people always liked. The canals survived because of that, and so will books and bookstores.”• Best of late-night TV.Stephen Colbert returned from an extended Thanksgiving weekend, introducing himself as “one of the few men still allowed on television.”• Quotation of the day.“When you put all these pieces together, what you’re left with is we are squandering a giant sum of money.”— Edward Kleinbard, a former chief of staff at the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation who now teaches law at the University of Southern California, on the proposed tax changes.Thirty-five years ago today, Michael Jackson released “Thriller,” which topped charts around the world and became the best-selling album globally.The King of Pop’s sixth studio album, “Thriller” infused a mix of pop, disco, funk and rock. It won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards in 1984, including Album of the Year. (Santana tied the record in 2000.)Statues of Mr. Jackson have been erected in countries from Australia and China to Italy and Brazil.Produced by the arranger and composer Quincy Jones, “Thriller” also broke racial barriers.The video for “Billie Jean” was one of the few from black artists to receive heavy airtime on MTV and is widely credited with helping to popularize the music network, which debuted in 1981.After the success of “Billie Jean,” MTV readily accepted the video for “Thriller,” the album’s title track. The zombie-filled video, by the director John Landis, cost $1 million to produce.In a review, The Times called the album a “wonderful pop record.”“Most important of all,” our reviewer wrote, “it is another signpost on the road to Michael Jackson’s own artistic fulfillment.”(Read more about the album and coverage of Mr. Jackson in The Times here.)Claudio E.

The show had been announced in May as a 12-week limited run, and it ran the full 12 weeks.“Michael Moore’s Broadway show was always meant to be a limited engagement,” said Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for the show. “It closed, as planned, on Sunday, Oct. 22. It was not forced to close early.”Mr. Trump’s assertion that the show was “a total bomb” is a matter of opinion, and in a barrage of tweets late Saturday, Mr. Moore declared his show a “smash hit” before touting his production and taunting the president.Given the show’s limited run and modest grosses, neither the phrase “total bomb” nor “smash hit” seems to be a precise description of its financial performance. The capitalization costs are not public for “The Terms of My Surrender,” which was produced by IMG Original Content and Carole Shorenstein Hays. But it played to houses that were often about three-quarters full, and its weekly grosses ranged from about $260,000 to $460,000. It took in $4.2 million over all and was seen by 74,484 people, according to the Broadway League.Of course, there are other ways to measure success, and earlier in the week Mr. Moore had issued a statement saying he was proud of the run.“My 100 performances on Broadway represent perhaps the most fulfilling experience of my career,” he said.“Broadway remains a powerful hub of American popular culture and I plan on being back — with both a new play and a new one-man show — soon,” he added. “As for ‘The Terms of My Surrender’ — there is no surrender! We’ll be taking our Broadway show on the road next summer!”Most Broadway shows fail financially, as Mr. Trump well knows: His one venture as a producer, of the play “Paris Is Out” in 1970, was a flop.Although Mr. Trump was a Broadway fan before he became president, “The Terms of My Surrender” is the second show he has tangled with since the 2016 election. Last November, after the cast of “Hamilton” challenged Vice President-elect Mike Pence from the stage, Mr. Trump criticized that show, saying he had heard it was “highly overrated.”During the run of “The Terms of My Surrender,” Mr. Moore claimed to have set aside a box nightly for Mr. Trump. The Twitter spat on Saturday marked the president’s first engagement with the show.', 'Jeff Flake Spoke Up. Time to Put Up. - The New York TimesIt was just a month ago this Friday that Senator Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican, rose in the Senate to insist that we “must never adjust to the present coarseness of our national dialogue,” laying a hefty share of the blame for it on “the tone set up at the top.”He used those remarks to condemn President Trump for “the daily sundering of our country.” He lashed out at the president’s “flagrant disregard for truth and decency” and uttered the syllables “enough.”It was some speech. And if he follows it by handing Trump a victory on tax reform, it was merely that: words. Pretty, yes. But pointless in the end.The House of Representatives has already approved its own legislation to overhaul the nation’s tax code. The Senate’s version could come to a vote as soon as next week. No Democrat in the chamber supports it, so the G.O.P. can afford to lose only two members of its caucus. Along with the votes of a few other Republicans, Flake’s is in doubt, and that colored another chapter of feuding between him and the president over recent days.Flake attended a town hall in Arizona and, apparently unaware that his microphone was still on, said that if Republicans “become the party of Roy Moore and Donald Trump, we are toast.”Trump took this in customary stride, which is to say that he fired up his Twitter account and mocked “Sen. Jeff Flake(y),” who, he predicted, would “be a NO on tax cuts.” Flake responded that he had not made up his mind.I’ll make it up for him: If he stands by that stirring Senate soliloquy and truly regards Trump as “dangerous to a democracy,” then this is much more than a vote about government revenue. It’s a choice between propping up and enfeebling an undeserving, unprincipled and frequently unhinged president who desperately needs a legislative triumph to hold on to his relevance and his best shot at a second term. Flake can lower corporate taxes or hobble Trump. In the grand scheme of things — in the scheme that he himself so eloquently laid out — there’s no contest between those concerns.That would be true even if this were a piece of legislation in line with the conservative fiscal principles that Flake and many of his fellow Republicans in the Senate espouse. It’s not.The last-minute addition of a repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate and the various accounting gimmicks built into the bill aren’t there so that tax reform doesn’t add to deficits. They’re there so that it doesn’t add to deficits by more than $1.5 trillion over 10 years. You can’t support this legislation and call yourself a deficit hawk. More like a deficit ostrich.That should be reason enough for Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican, to vote no. What’s more, he has also denounced Trump as “an utterly untruthful president” who needs “adult day care” and is “unable to rise to the occasion.” Does Corker want to march in lock step with such a disaster or trip him up?That same question goes to John McCain, to Susan Collins and to other Senate Republicans who have indicated grave apprehensions about Trump. Their party’s donors may be demanding tax reform. They themselves may believe in some of the bill’s particulars. But do they believe in this president? In where he has tugged the G.O.P.? Do they want to aid him, or put him behind them as quickly as possible?Some Republicans beyond Trump would be hurt by a defeat on tax reform. But they’d be hurt more in the long run by sustained surrender to him. To crib a phrase from Flake, they’d be toast.In his book “Conscience of a Conservative,” which was published in August and was the prelude to his big speech, Flake wrote that Republicans indulged Trump by rationalizing that he might help them “achieve some long-held policy goals.” But Flake added that if this “put at risk our institutions and our values,” it raised the question of “whether any such policy victories wouldn’t be Pyrrhic ones.”That question is no less pertinent now. Trump continues, on an almost daily basis, to dishonor the presidency and debase civic life. We may be getting more used to him; he’s not getting any better. He picks gratuitous fights — with the widow of a slain soldier, with the father of a detained college basketball player. He curtsies to the Russians and the Chinese. He petrifies his own inner circle. His secretary of state supposedly called him a “moron.” His national security adviser reportedly opted for “idiot” and “dope.”Flake’s message a month ago had a more elevated vocabulary but the same urgency. He said that lawmakers must be “unafraid to stand up and speak out as if our country depends on it, because it does.” Was that preening or patriotism? He can show us with a single vote.', 'A Lesson for Democrats - The New York TimesTo the Editor:In “Democrats, Don’t Be Fooled by Victory” (column, Nov. 13), David Leonhardt mentions a number of things Democratic candidates can do to win back white working-class voters.To those I would add that candidates learn to speak to these voters in simple, ordinary, everyday language that people can connect to. Donald Trump did this, and it was a major reason he got so much support.While Mr. Trump said, I’m going to get your jobs back, Democrats said, We’re going to implement innovative policies intended to enhance employment opportunities.Not the way to connect with anybody. Democrats, speak simply!BOB MORRISON, ATLANTA', 'President Trump said Saturday that he would never call North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “short and fat,” after Kim’s government slammed Trump as an “old lunatic” following a recent speech in neighboring South Korea. “Why would Kim Jong Un insult me by calling me ‘old’, when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’ Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend -- and maybe someday that will happen!,” Trump tweeted Saturday evening while in Vietnam, as part of his five-nation Asian trip.Trump was responding to North Korea calling his South Korea speech days earlier: “reckless remarks by an old lunatic."Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me "old," when I would NEVER call him "short and fat?" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!The president is visiting China, South Korea and other countries in the region in an effort to get them to help put pressure on North Korea to curtail its pursuit of a nuclear weapons arsenal. Trump said he also spoke while in Vietnam earlier this weekend with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the North Korea issue.“Do not underestimate us,” Trump said Tuesday in a speech delivered to South Korea\'s National Assembly. “And do not try us. ... The weapons you\'re acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger. Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face."On Saturday, Kim\'s government responded by accusing Trump of trying to demonize North Korea, keep it apart from the international community and undermine its government."Reckless remarks by an old lunatic like Trump will never scare us or stop our advance," the North\'s Foreign Ministry said in a statement."On the contrary, all this makes us more sure that our choice to promote economic construction at the same time as building up our nuclear force is all the more righteous, and it pushes us to speed up the effort to complete our nuclear force."North Korea is not known to have tested any of its missiles or nuclear devices since Sept. 15, after a brisk series of tests earlier this year.The Associated Press contributed to this report.', "HANOI, Vietnam – Questions about Russian meddling in the 2016 election have followed President Donald Trump to Asia.Trump said during a news conference Sunday in Vietnam that he believes U.S. intelligence agencies, which have concluded Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help him win.But Trump also says he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin when Putin claims his country did no such thing.Trump's comments came shortly before he took off for the Philippines, the final stop of his five-country Asia trip.Trump is slated to attend a pair of international summits over the next two days as well as meet with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte.Duterte has come under fierce criticism from human rights groups for overseeing a violent drug war complete with extrajudicial killings.", 'President posts that he works well with the secretary of state and that media speculation that illerson is being fired is \'fake news\'; John Roberts reports from the White House.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is not leaving the Trump administration despite recent speculation, President Donald Trump said on Friday afternoon."The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - FAKE NEWS," Trump tweeted. "He’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again!"The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - FAKE NEWS! He’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again!https://t.co/FrqiPLFJ1EA photo of Trump and Vice President Mike Pence attending the swearing-in ceremony of Tillerson accompanied the tweet.The response from the president follows reports earlier this week that Tillerson was expected to resign from his post in January and would potentially be succeeded by current CIA Director Mike Pompeo. The succession plan would then involve nominating Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton to take Pompeo\'s role with the CIA.Another possible but less-likely scenario that was floated on Thursday would\'ve moved U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley to the State Department.WHO IS REX TILLERSON?State Department Press Secretary Heather Nauert addressed questions about Tillerson’s future and cited assurances from the White House."He remains the secretary of state and as long as he serves at the pleasure of the president, he will continue to do that job," Nauert said. "He’s heard these kinds of stories before, and he’s just going about his business."Nauert told reporters that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly called Tillerson early Thursday when reports first broke, to assure him the “rumors are not true.”“We have no comment,” a CIA spokesperson told Fox News on Thursday, when asked about the discussions.The former Exxon Mobile chairman and CEO has had a reportedly contentious relationship with the president.In October, reports surfaced thatTillerson allegedly called Trump a "moron" after a meeting with cabinet officials in July. The comments came after President Trump gave a controversial speech to the Boy Scouts of America. Tillerson, who served as the president of the organization from 2010-2012, was reportedly upset over the content of the speech and allegedlythreatened to quit.Trump later labeled the report“fake news.”Fox News\' Brooke Singman, Madeline Farber and Zoe Szathmary contributed to this report.', 'Can Donald Trump Save Roy Moore After All? - The New York TimesDAPHNE, Ala. — Election season is always a tense time in Alabama, still shadowed as we are by George Wallace’s “segregation forever” antics and the dread among educated voters that our latest political star will humiliate the state yet again in the eyes of the nation.But not since the state sent William Lowndes Yancey, the original secessionist “fire eater,” to Congress in 1844 has the Alabama embarrassment syndrome reached a more acute stage than this past week, when Roy Moore, the homophobic front-runner in the United States Senate special election next month, was accused in The Washington Post of sexually molesting a 14-year-old girl after luring her to his remote home in the Alabama hills.Coming on the heels of Republican losses in Virginia on Tuesday, the Dec. 12 election in Alabama, which prides itself as a spiritual heartland of the Trump revolution, will be closely watched as a critical test of Mr. Trump’s political vitality. Even before the Moore allegations surfaced, his race against the Democratic nominee, Doug Jones, a celebrated prosecutor of Klan bombers, presented a potentially historic breach in Alabama’s long record of electing the candidate best known for radical showmanship.I decided to head to my home state to watch this race when Mr. Moore, a former state Supreme Court judge, won the Republican nomination in September over Luther Strange, a lumbering former state attorney general known as Big Luther who was endorsed by Mr. Trump and financed by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Mr. Moore is a fundamentalist Christian who channels Reaganesque cowboy imagery and rides a horse named Sassy to his polling place. He crushed the charisma-challenged Mr. Strange, stunning elite Republicans, whose party is being consumed by class warfare between suburbanites and the rural white evangelicals who make up Mr. Trump’s base.Born in Birmingham in 1943, I found the contest an irresistible collision between national forces and Alabama’s political tradition. Elections here are performance art, with victory the reward for eye-catching clowns like Yancey, Cotton Tom Heflin in the 1920s, Jim Folsom in the 1940s and 1950s, Wallace in the 1960s, and now Mr. Moore.Nationally, Mr. Moore is known for ranting against gay people, but he is most celebrated at home for putting a granite monument of more than 5,000 pounds engraved with the Ten Commandments in the rotunda of the state judicial building and giving up his job as chief justice rather than obey a court order for its removal. In other words, he was cast perfectly to star in Alabama’s timeless election carnival of romanticized defiance and self-parody. My earliest surviving commentary on state politics was written in a letter in 1954 to my brother, then a soldier in Germany. I referred to a speech praising Bull Connor as “sickening.” He was subsequently re-elected to command the police and fire departments as Birmingham public safety commissioner, setting the stage for his fire hoses and police dogs in 1963.By 1965, as a reporter, I was writing in The Birmingham Post-Herald about Wallace’s segregation rallies. At The New York Times, I wrote a magazine piece about coming-of-age in Birmingham’s racial caldron. My 1977 book, “My Soul Is Rested,” was one of the first works to describe a man known as Dynamite Bob, a Connor associate and a Wallace acquaintance later revealed to be Robert Chambliss, as the leader of the Klan bomb squads.The tradition of rebelling against progress has left Alabama as the only state of the Old Confederacy never to have elected a senator or governor untainted by scandal who was willing to embrace modern attitudes on race, social justice and economic fairness. As I sat in the Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church in Daphne recently, I wondered if Mr. Jones, a steelworker’s son, could become the first campaigner to confront Alabamians’ mind-set of grievance.“We started in Alabama on the wrong side of history,” Mr. Jones said at the church. “Let’s not let those ghosts define us.” A day earlier, he had said: “Roy Moore represents a backward look. I’m tired of Alabama being an embarrassment around the country.”To my knowledge no other candidate had addressed the Alabama inferiority complex so directly as Mr. Jones, with the exception of Wallace, arguing in the opposite direction. In 1963, Wallace had journeyed to Harvard to assure an incredulous student audience that Alabama had “good race relations.” In that same speech, he blamed immoral Yankee soldiers for the presence of light-skinned black people in Alabama.Bob Zellner can attest firsthand to Wallace’s absurdities at Harvard’s Memorial Hall. Mr. Zellner, son of an Alabama Klansman, joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in 1961 and became its first white field secretary. At the Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church, Mr. Jones praised him from the pulpit as one of Alabama’s civil rights heroes. Over 50 years ago, an astonished Wallace had singled him out from the lectern at Harvard, having discovered that the Alabama rebel had followed him north. “Oh, I know you,” Wallace said, labeling Mr. Zellner a troublemaking jailbird for the question he put to Wallace about Alabama’s police brutality and murders of civil rights workers.“Alabama has always had a victim’s complex,” Mr. Zellner told me in an email. “Wallace was always ‘sending a message’ to the elite, pointy-headed rich people but he ended up turning one group of little people against other little people while helping the rich get richer. The worst available candidate, the most radical, would always get the most attention, the highest ratings.”I had never met Mr. Zellner until I sought him out in Daphne. There we were, two native sons of the Heart of Dixie, bound by hope as part of a standing-room-only crowd that Mr. Jones said represented “a shining Alabama the way it was always supposed to be.” The audience was about equally composed of black and white, young and old. How many of those whites were crossover Republicans? That’s the question that will determine whether Alabama sends its first truly New South figure to Washington.Like the national Republican Party, Alabama’s microcosmic version of Trump World was split along class lines. Even before the allegations about Mr. Moore’s predatory sexual history dropped, Mr. Jones seemed to be whittling Mr. Moore’s double-digit lead by assuring upper-class Republicans that their Confederate ancestors would recognize the “honor in compromise and civility.” His has been the most vigorous Democratic campaign in decades and, perhaps prophetically for Mr. Trump, the wealthiest Republican enclaves like Mountain Brook near Birmingham and Fairhope on Mobile Bay are covered with Jones lawn signs. Less affluent suburbs with highly educated professionals, like Vestavia Hills and Hoover near Birmingham, follow the pattern.I asked two prominent Fairhope residents about how their wealthy peers would vote. One, a liberal, said his neighbors on Mobile Bay’s fashionable Eastern Shore would claim to support Mr. Jones and then secretly vote for Mr. Moore, a man they would not invite to their homes.Another, a conservative, said “most of my Republican friends say they are going to vote for Jones” because Mr. Moore would shame the state. As to how local Republicans will finally split, he predicted half would vote for Mr. Jones and half might stay home. “That would be all right, too,” Mr. Jones told me later when I described the conversation.But things will be more complicated now that Mr. Moore has been wounded. Republican leaders in rural counties are urging voters to ignore allegations from nearly 40 years ago that don’t involve forcible rape. Alabama’s eccentric state auditor, Jim Zeigler, is even assuring evangelicals that they can stick with Mr. Moore in good faith because many women in the Bible, including Mary, the mother of Jesus, were married to older men.So the Alabama Republican Party is on the horns of another dilemma. Republican leaders in the Washington swamp are telling them to dump Mr. Moore. Local Trump supporters are telling them to ignore “fake news” and stand up for Alabama. Mr. Strange is lurking in the wings, feeding speculation that he could save his party’s respectability from Mr. Moore and Steve Bannon as a write-in candidate. But a split between Moore loyalists and Strange write-ins would hand the election to Mr. Jones, something that Mr. Trump can ill afford after the roughing up he took on Tuesday.Until now, the Moore campaign has believed that Alabama’s brand of glittery sideshows would, sooner or later, summon Mr. Trump’s inner showman and that he would sweep in to push Mr. Moore over the top. That would spoil the dream of Alabama’s embattled Democrats that Mr. Jones might pull off what would be the biggest political upset here since the populist “Big Jim” Folsom and his rustic Strawberry Pickers beat the “big mules” of U.S. Steel and the Black Belt plantations in 1946. (Mr. Trump himself has not spoken about the Moore allegations, but his press secretary said that Mr. Trump believes Mr. Moore should quit the race “if these allegations are true.”)For the next month, Mr. Moore’s disappearing inevitability, Mr. Jones’s hope-based insurgency and the strain between have and have-not Republicans will be debated every day in the state’s meat-and-three restaurants. Mr. Trump, given his own baggage and the freewheeling defiance of Alabama voters, would do well to watch cautiously. Mr. Zellner and I can attest that political theater can be tricky here. Alabama voters don’t mind being in the spotlight, no matter how bad it makes them look. They have that in common with the president.', 'Saudi Arabia’s Special Power Over Donald Trump - The New York TimesConsider this foreign policy challenge: A Mideast leader undertakes a stunning power play to cement domestic control, carrying out mass arrests without due process and installing loyalists in key ministries. He ratchets up criticism of a regional rival and accuses it of effectively declaring war. And another Mideast leader, while on a visit to the first one’s country, abruptly resigns and doesn’t return home.If all this were happening in Iran, it’s a fair guess that President Trump, Congress and a host of other voices would react with outrage. In truth, the scenario sums up what’s been happening in Saudi Arabia in the last week under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. And Mr. Trump could not have been more effusive. “I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing,” he tweeted.There’s a big difference, of course, between Saudi Arabia and Iran; the former is an American ally, the latter an antagonist. But it has not been American practice to give allies a free pass when they’re destabilizing the region, and Saudi policies, both domestic and foreign, have become increasingly aggressive under Crown Prince Mohammed. In addition to his power play, he’s escalated Saudi involvement in Yemen; continued his boycott of Qatar, ostensibly another American ally; and made inflammatory statements about Iran. Saad Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, resigned a week ago while in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in circumstances that remain a mystery.No problem, suggests Mr. Trump, who made clear early on that he would side with the kingdom and its Sunni allies against Shiite-led Iran. But there is a problem: Mr. Trump’s uncritical support of the prince’s behavior is stirring fears of a war with Iran and undermining American interests.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson knows this, even if his boss doesn’t. On Friday Mr. Tillerson reaffirmed Lebanon’s independence, hailed Mr. Hariri and cautioned against using Lebanon for proxy conflicts. His words were a stern, if indirect, admonishment to Saudi Arabia. And to his boss in the Oval Office. Though why should a headstrong Saudi prince pay any attention to an American underling who has been repeatedly undermined by that same boss?', 'Egypt, Roy Moore, Donald Trump: Your Weekend Briefing - The New York TimesHere are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead.1. With Thanksgiving behind us, the country is sliding rapidly toward the year’s end, and Republican leaders are returning to Capitol Hill to hurtle their tax plan through Congress.Their central promise: Cutting corporate taxes will lift the middle class. However, few American companies appear ready to raise wages. In a letter to executives of communications giants, a union asked for a pledge in writing.And some state officials see the $1.5 trillion cut raising taxes for residents, straining budgets and shaking real estate markets — and forcing tough decisions at the local level.____2. Other stressors in Washington: the State Department’s ejection of droves of career diplomats under Rex Tillerson; a sudden fight over the leadership of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; and indications that Michael Flynn, above, President Trump’s former national security adviser, could be moving to cooperate with Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.Speculation about the role of Jared Kushner, who has disappeared from public view lately, comes as the long shadow of the investigation darkens the White House.And while it may seem that these accusations of interference could hurt President Vladimir Putin’s reputation in Russia, they might be having the opposite effect.____3. At least 305 people were killed and at least 128 others wounded when Islamic State militants detonated explosives and sprayed gunfire at a crowded Sufi mosque near Egypt’s Sinai coast.One of the most striking aspects of the attack, the deadliest in Egypt’s modern history, was how easy it was for militants to carry it out.The ruthless assault sent shock waves across the nation, not only for the death toll but also for the choice of target — mosques are rarely attacked in Egypt. But Sufism, a mystical school of Islam that emphasizes the inward search for divinity, is hated by some extremists.____4. Several European countries are in the throes of political uncertainty, particularly Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel’s failure to form a coalition government presents a profound crisis of leadership for Europe and may signal the end of the country’s postwar tradition of compromise.Italy, worried about meddling and fake news in its coming election, is asking Facebook to police its platforms. And Ireland could be headed toward a snap election, just weeks before it is set to play a central role in Britain’s planned exit from the European Union.Brexit’s toll is already being seen as crucial European agencies relocate, an ominous sign of what may be to come.____5. Emmerson Mnangagwa, 75, is the new president of Zimbabwe. He replaces Robert Mugabe, 93, the strongman he helped oust in a bloodless coup. The question now: Can a leader so closely tied to the country’s old guard bring real change? Above, supporters of Mr. Mnangagwa.Elsewhere in Africa, Rwanda offered to house or help repatriate some of the thousands of African migrants being held in Libya — some reportedly auctioned as slaves. The unusual gesture from the small country could stem migration into Europe.____6. Pope Francis will be walking a diplomatic tightrope during his first official visit to Myanmar, where Muslim Rohingya have endured unspeakable atrocities at the hands of the military. The Trump administration declared Myanmar’s crackdown on the Rohingya “ethnic cleansing.”The Pope, above at the Vatican last week, has expressed concern for the Rohingya many times, though one big question looms: Will he utter the word “Rohingya,” a term not recognized by Aung San Suu Kyi, who leads the civilian government?____7. President Trump wished Americans a happy Thanksgiving from Palm Beach, Fla., where he indulged in some of his favorite activities: golfing with pros and tweeting about how he and the country are winning. He spoke to troops via video teleconference and passed out sandwiches at a Coast Guard station.The president continued his personal attacks against sports figures, many of them African-American. And he said he had declined Time magazine’s offer to be “named Man (Person) of the Year,” prompting the editors to tweet, “The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year.”Among other topics he addressed: the allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers facing Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama. “He totally denies it,” Mr. Trump observed. By defending Mr. Moore, the president has further fueled hostilities within his party.____8. As sexual harassment allegations continue to undo once-beloved figures like Charlie Rose, above, Kevin Spacey and Louis C.K., our culture is tangled in questions of what to do with their art.Outside Hollywood, the Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas joined others in saying that she had endured abuse by Lawrence Nassar, a team doctor.And scrutiny in Washington turned to two Minnesota lawmakers, Tony Cornish and Dan Schoen; the House’s longest-serving lawmaker, John Conyers Jr.; and Representative Joe Barton of Texas, who apologized for a nude photo of himself that was posted on Twitter.____9. For the Inuit community of Rigolet, Labrador, the only road is the ice. But climate change is making that ice vanish, and the mental health impact runs deep.“Inuit are people of the sea ice,” one man said. “If there is no more sea ice, how can we be people of the sea ice?”____10. Finally, as the weather gets colder and with the holiday season in full swing, there’s no better time to cozy up inside with a book. If your reading list needs inspiration, look no further than the 100 notable books of the past year, chosen by the editors of our Book Review.Have a great week._____Your Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Evening Briefing, weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern.Want to look back?

But I guess this is what you have to expect when you hand over the reins of power to a con man, whose whole career has been based on convincing naïve marks that he’s a brilliant deal maker, but turns out to have no idea how to actually govern.Oh, wait — did you think I was talking about Donald Trump? I’m talking about Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, an obvious phony who nonetheless convinced the rubes — that is, much of the news media and the political establishment — that he was a brilliant fiscal expert. What we’re witnessing now is the end of the charade, the political equivalent of what happened when graduates of Trump University tried to get some value in return for their money.On Thursday, House Republicans unveiled a tax “reform” bill with the same good order and careful deliberation with which they unveiled their various attempts to repeal Obamacare. That is, after having had years to prepare, the G.O.P. waited until the last minute to throw something together, without any hearings or serious analysis.Budget wonks are frantically going through the legislative language, trying to figure out what it means and what it would do — but they can take some comfort in the fact that the bill’s authors are almost equally in the dark.O.K., some things are clear: The bill would give huge tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy, especially wealthy heirs, while opening vast new opportunities for tax avoidance. You won’t go far wrong if you think of the big tax cuts in the law as having been custom designed to benefit the Trump family.But these big tax cuts would blow a multitrillion-dollar hole in the budget, so Republicans have been scrambling to find “pay-fors” that limit the addition to the deficit. What they came up with was a hodgepodge of stuff: ending deductions for some state and local taxes, limiting deductions for mortgage interest, phasing out child tax credits, and so on.Since the point of these measures is to offset tax cuts for the rich, they will, more or less by definition, end up raising taxes on large numbers of middle-class families.Will this bill pass the House? Unclear: Some important interest groups, like homebuilders and the small-business lobby, have already declared opposition. In any case, it almost surely can’t become law in anything like its current form: A tax bill can’t pass the Senate with less than 60 votes if it raises the long-term budget deficit, which this bill surely does. In fact, this bill might not even get a simple Senate majority.So right now tax cuts are looking like health care redux: With many years to prepare, Republicans turn out to be completely unready for prime time. But how did they get to this point?The answer is that this week’s debacle was predictable from the moment, more than seven years ago, that Ryan began establishing himself as a media darling by publishing impressive-looking blueprints for fiscal reform with titles like “Roadmap for America’s Future.”Like the bill just released, all these blueprints included huge tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy; but Ryan insisted that any revenue losses would be made up for by ending unjustified tax breaks. Which tax breaks would he eliminate? He refused to say.These evasions worked brilliantly as a public relations strategy. Those who warned about his plans’ phoniness were ignored. Ryan even received awards for fiscal responsibility.But actual legislation can’t close huge fiscal gaps with vague promises. To hand out those big tax cuts while raising the deficit by “only” $1.5 trillion, Republicans needed to find real money somewhere, and that turns out to be really hard.The big question should be, why do any of this? Ryan used to claim that his plans were about reducing the budget deficit, but he has now given up that pretense.And why should tax cuts even be on the table? We have budget deficits, not surpluses, and lots of unmet needs for future spending. U.S. taxes are low, not high, compared with other wealthy countries. Predictions that tax cuts will lead to rapid economic growth have been wrong time and again. And by large margins, voters want taxes on corporations and the wealthy to go up, not down.The ruling theory among Republicans seems to be that going into the midterm elections they need a “win” to offset their failure to repeal Obamacare. I guess this might be right, although it’s a theory that reveals extraordinary contempt for voters, who are supposed to be impressed by the G.O.P.’s ability to ram through policies that only benefit a tiny elite.However the politics turn out, this is remarkably terrible policy, devised via a remarkably terrible process. Most Americans realize that Donald Trump is a very bad president; they need to realize that his party’s congressional leadership is pretty awful, too.', '', 'Donald Trump, Iran Earthquake, N.F.L.: Your Monday Briefing - The New York Times (Want to get this briefing by email?

In Manila today, he noted his “great relationship” with President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. A day earlier, Mr. Trump denounced his critics, from the “haters and fools” investigating his ties to Russia to North Korea’s leader, whom he said he could call “short and fat.”• A blitz of sexual harassment scandals has hit statehouses from California to Florida, with accusations that might have been ignored in the past drawing aggressive responses.“There’s not the sense of trying to defend these guys in the same way,” said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for Women and American Politics at Rutgers University.Senate Republicans appear to have largely abandoned the candidacy of Roy Moore, the Republican nominee in Alabama accused of pursuing relationships with teenage girls when he was in his 30s.

Europe claims the longest traffic tunnels: a 35-mile Swiss achievement; the 31-mile “Chunnel” under the English Channel; and, in Norway, the singular Laerdal Tunnel, which has even hosted weddings.Then there’s the Aqua-Line in Tokyo, 8.7 miles of underwater channel with a few miles of bridge riding atop.China, ever competitive as it seeks to meet the needs of more than a billion people, aims to build the world’s longest water tunnel: a 600-mile conduit from Tibet to a desert in Xinjiang.Andrea Kannapell contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning.

He was soon followed by missionaries and sugar cane growers. In 1842, King Kamehameha III, concerned that foreign powers might seize Hawaiian territory, tried to negotiate independence treaties with the U.S., Britain and France.The king had good reason to be worried. The following year, a British naval captain occupied the Hawaiian kingdom for five months before his superiors arrived to overrule him. The kingdom’s return to Kamehameha’s rule on July 31, 1843, became known as Sovereignty Restoration Day.A few months later, Britain and France recognized Hawaiian independence.It was short-lived. A group of Americans and Europeans overthrew Queen Liliuokalani in 1893 when she tried to rewrite the Constitution, and Hawaii was annexed by the U.S. in 1898. In 1959, it became the 50th state.Hawaiian Independence Day and Sovereignty Restoration Day continue to be observed by activists who say the islands are still being occupied, only now by the U.S.Jennifer Jett contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning.

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.Here’s what you need to know:• Republicans sound increasingly optimistic about the fate of the Senate’s tax bill, after the Budget Committee voted along party lines on Tuesday to advance the $1.5 trillion package. Follow the latest developments on our live briefing.Here’s what the bill would mean for 25,000 middle-class families.With a procedural vote planned today, the Republican mood is far different from earlier this year: “At this point in the health care debate, people were walking out and talking about each other’s mamas and getting mad and it just wasn’t healthy, it wasn’t productive,” one senator said. “It was like a bunch of kids in the back of a minivan.”• Also on Tuesday, the effort to avert a government shutdown next month got off to a rocky start after talks between President Trump and Democratic leaders broke down.• The network has dismissed Mr. Lauer, its leading morning news anchor, over a sexual harassment allegation.Andrew Lack, the network’s president for news, said in a memo sent to staff today that a “detailed complaint from a colleague” against Mr. Lauer “represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company’s standards. As a result, we’ve decided to terminate his employment.”• Mr. Lauer’s co-host, Savannah Guthrie, announced the news on “Today” this morning. Appearing on the verge of tears, Ms. Guthrie said, “All we can say is we are heartbroken; I’m heartbroken.” (Read a transcript of her remarks.)• Pyongyang said today that it had successfully tested a missile that could deliver nuclear warheads anywhere in the continental U.S.President Trump said “we will handle” the situation.

The Nova actually sold well in Latin America.GAC officials told our Shanghai bureau chief that, in Chinese, Trumpchi sounded a little like “passing on happiness.” Any decision on changing the name, they said, would be announced in January — at an auto show in Detroit.Charles McDermid contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning.

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who is pressuring the judiciary panel\'s chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to subpoena Trump Jr. to testify publicly.Public testimony is necessary “to compel him to fully account for his actions in front of the American people,” Blumenthal said, according to the Hill.Blumenthal cited Trump Jr.’s Twitter communications with WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign as one of a “number of cascading disclosures that suggest collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials,” the paper reported.Russian hackers reportedly accessed Democratic National Committee emails that were later distributed via WikiLeaks, according to U.S. intelligence officials. However, the organization’s founder, Julian Assange, disputes the claim, telling Fox News earlier this year that the “source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party.”“Mr. Trump, Jr.’s refusal to testify before the Committee means that key questions have been left unanswered,” Blumenthal added.Trump Jr. was subpoenaed earlier this year by the committee, but it was later dismissed after he agreed to cooperate.Rob Goldstone, the British publicist who reportedly arranged the infamous meeting between Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer, will also go before the House and Senate Intelligence committees possibly sometime next week, CNN reported.The publicist hinted last month in an interview with the Sunday Times that he was ready to talk with Special Counsel Robert Mueller and put his “recollection of events in the public record.""After the story initially broke, it seemed to quiet down for a while. But now it\'s back in the news with such force, I feel it\'s time for me to explain what happened," he told the paper.Last week, former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI in Mueller’s ongoing investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump administration.Benjamin Brown is a reporter for Fox News.

The Commissioner has lost control of the hemorrhaging league. Players are the boss! https://t.co/udXP5MR8BC"Can you believe that the disrespect for our Country, our Flag, our Anthem continues without penalty to the players.

Trump tweeted.In recent months, Trump has demanded the NFL suspend or fire players who have taken a knee during the anthem. The players say they do so to draw attention to police brutality against blacks. About 70 percent of players in the NFL are black.Trump also turned on NBA star Stephen Curry back in September after Curry, a guard with the Golden State Warriors, suggested he would not attend the traditional White House champions visit.“Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team. Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn,” Trump tweeted.Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!Most recently, Trump’s gotten into a cyber spat with the father of one of the three UCLA basketball players arrested in China for shoplifting. Trump took issue with LaVar Ball downplaying Trump’s role in securing the players’ release.“Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and [believes] that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!” he tweeted.Trump also tweeted Friday that he will be speaking to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about bringing peace to the region – or, as Trump puts it, “the mess that I inherited in the Middle East.”He continued, “I will get it all done, but what a mistake, in lives and dollars (6 trillion), to be there in the first place!”Following his talk with Erdogan, the president tweeted he would round out the day by playing golf with Woods and Dustin Johnson then head back to his private resort Mar-a-Lago, often called the winter White House, for “talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the USA!”After Turkey call I will be heading over to Trump National Golf Club, Jupiter, to play golf (quickly) with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson. Then back to Mar-a-Lago for talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the USA!', '‘Trump White House’ Reality Show Recap: An Ex-Wife Claims First Lady Title - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — In a time of several threatening international crises, an explosive exchange came out of the Trump White House on Monday that had nothing to do with a foreign adversary. The target was a former wife.Melania Trump’s East Wing lashed out at President Trump’s first wife, Ivana, for jokingly referring to herself as first lady.Ivana Trump — the mother to Mr. Trump’s oldest three children and the wife whose divorce from Mr. Trump elevated him to a constant tabloid fixture — was promoting her new memoir during an interview that aired on “Good Morning America” when she said she had a “direct number” to the White House and called the president every two weeks.“I’m basically first Trump wife,” the Czech-born Mrs. Trump said with a laugh. “I’m first lady, O.K.”This joke apparently struck a nerve with the actual first lady.Stephanie Grisham, the third Mrs. Trump’s communications director, unleashed a scorching statement against the first lady’s marital predecessor.“Mrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President. She loves living in Washington, D.C., and is honored by her role as first lady of the United States,” Ms. Grisham said in an email. “She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books.”Ms. Grisham added a tabloidlike coup de grâce: “There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex, this is unfortunately only attention-seeking and self-serving noise.”Such media fisticuffs were, until Monday, an unusual move for Melania Trump’s placid, and somewhat sparsely populated, East Wing. But they are second nature to certain members of the Trump family, purveyors of high-profile marital drama since 1992, the year Mr. Trump and Ivana Trump, a former model, ended their marriage in what she called “brutal” divorce negotiations. Mr. Trump’s second wife, Marla Maples, ensured another dizzying round of media attention. (The first Mrs. Trump said in the interview that she does not refer to Ms. Maples by name: She is instead known as “The Showgirl.”)Melania Trump, a former model born in Slovenia, has been somewhat of a departure because she does not court attention and tends to choose her words carefully. She is also becoming a more visible first lady. In the past few weeks, Mrs. Trump has ramped up her appearances and will travel on Tuesday to Huntington, W.Va., to visit Lily’s Place, an infant recovery center that supports families dealing with addiction.In recent weeks, Mrs. Trump, who once emphasized that her platform will focus on combating cyberbullying, has shifted her focus to learning more about the opioid epidemic. More than two million Americans are estimated to have problems with the drugs, and Appalachia has some of the highest overdose rates in the country.“She has stated many times that she wants to utilize her role as first lady to help as many children as she can, with the many issues and challenges they face as they are growing up,” Ms. Grisham said. “The opioid crisis is one of those issues, and is affecting children and their families nationwide.”In August, Mr. Trump said that the opioid epidemic was a “national emergency,” but the White House has so far not made a formal declaration on the matter. When asked about the first lady’s plans for cyberbullying, Ms. Grisham said that Mrs. Trump’s focus “includes many different aspects of what children face today.”Ms. Grisham did not respond when asked why Ivana Trump’s interview warranted the East Wing’s response. Among other revelations, the first Mrs. Trump said that she uses her phone calls with the president to encourage discretion — “Sometimes I tell him just not to speak that much,” she said — and that she did not mind if her children engage in the sort of Twitter taunting their father enjoys.“If they are losers,” Mrs. Trump said of potential Trump family Twitter targets, “they are losers, O.K.? And I don’t mind it.”', '', 'President Donald Trump\'s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, tweeted an email thread on how a meeting with a Russian lawyer with potentially incriminating information on Hillary Clinton came to fruition, leading up to the 2016 presidential electionDonald Trump Jr. arrived on Capitol Hill Wednesday to meet with House Intelligence Committee investigators as the lawmakers continue to probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, is expected to face questions pertaining to his family’s financial dealings with Russians. He is also expected to be asked about a controversial meeting he scheduled with members of the Trump campaign and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York City in June 2016.Wednesday’s meeting is behind closed doors. Trump Jr. already privately met with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in September.The New York Times reported in July that Trump Jr. met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya during the campaign after learning that she had damaging information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic opponent of Donald Trump.Read on for more information about Trump Jr.’s meeting, and how he’s involved in the Russia investigation.Before Trump Jr. was set to meet with the Russian lawyer as his father campaigned for the presidency, Trump Jr. was told Veselnitskaya’s potentially damning information about Clinton was from the Kremlin, the New York Times reported.The report was the first public word that Trump Jr. took the meeting with the understanding that he would be presented with damaging information about his father’s political opponent and that the material could have emanated from the Kremlin.Trump Jr. has maintained that Veselnitskaya did not have any information to share and instead wanted to discuss other matters, such as the Magnitsky Act which enacts sanctions on certain Russian officials as punishment for human rights violations.“After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,” Trump Jr.said in an earlier statement.“Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered,” Trump Jr. continuedTrump’s son-in-lawJared Kushnerand then-campaign chairmanPaul Manafortalso attended the meeting along with a translator.A spokesperson for Trump’s outside legal team said Trump “was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.”Trump Jr. posted screenshots of multiple emails purportedly from Rob Goldstone, a music publicist who wanted to set up the meeting.Here\'s my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQHere is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints). pic.twitter.com/z1Xi4nr2gqIn a June 3, 2016 email, Goldstone said he was asked to “contact you with something very interesting.”“The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,” Goldstone said.He added that the information was “very high level and sensitive” but was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”Trump Jr. responded in less than 20 minutes saying that he wanted to check out the information first, but “if it’s what you say I love it especially later in summer.”In another email, Goldstone referred to Veselnitskaya as “the Russian government attorney.”But in a later statement, Trump Jr. said she “was not a government official.”The Kremlin, too, denied knowing her. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the Kremlin “cannot keep track” of every Russian lawyer who holds meetings in Russia or abroad.As Trump Jr. does not have a position in his father’s administration, he is not required to disclose foreign contacts, according to the Associated Press.Foreign nationals are prohibited from providing "anything of value" to campaigns, and that same law also bars solicitation of such assistance. The law typically applies to monetary campaign contributions, but courts could consider information such as opposition research to be something of value.Bradley A. Smith, a former Bill Clinton-appointed Republican Federal Election Commission member, said that based on what\'s known about the meeting, Trump Jr.\'s actions are unlikely to be considered illegal solicitation."It\'s not illegal to meet with someone to find out what they have to offer," Smith said.But Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the FEC, said the situation "raises all sorts of red flags.""You do not want your campaign to be involved with foreign nationals, period," said Noble, now senior director at the Campaign Legal Center.Fox News’ Benjamin Brown and Bree Tracey contributed to this report, along with the Associated Press.Kaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

Trump Jr. left without speaking to reporters about what was discussed."I don\'t think you can shield conversations by only having an attorney present."Trump Jr. has claimed he didn\'t tell the president about the meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russians when it happened and he declined to elaborate on what he ultimately told him after the meeting became public.Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said that Trump Jr. said he couldn\'t speak about the conversations with his father because of attorney-client privilege, telling the committee a lawyer was present when he spoke to his father about the meeting and the emails that led up to it."I don’t think you can shield conversations by only having an attorney present," the California lawmaker said.The Trump Tower meeting is a matter of keen interest to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is also investigating the meddling and whether there was any obstruction of justice. Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner, Trump\'s son-in-law, attended the meeting with several Russian operatives under the impression that they might receive damaging information about the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton.Mueller is also interested in the White House response to the meeting once it became public. The White House has said the president was involved in drafting an early statement saying the meeting primarily concerned a Russian adoption program, but emails later released by Trump Jr. showed that he enthusiastically agreed to the sit-down with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others after he was promised dirt on his father\'s rival. Trump Jr. later said the promised material never materialized.Trump Jr. said during Wednesday\'s interview that he spoke with President Trump\'s communications aide Hope Hicks as early reports of the meeting emerged, according to one person familiar with the interview. The New York Times was first to report the existence of the meeting, and Trump Jr. eventually released the emails detailing the planning for it.Hicks was with the president on Air Force One while they were writing the statement that said the meeting primarily concerned the adoption program.Trump Jr. also told the intelligence panel that he didn\'t tell his father about the 2016 meeting at the time that it happened, according to the person familiar with his interview. The person was not authorized to speak about the testimony and asked not to be identified.Julian Assange of WikiLeaks.        Trump Jr. also voluntarily testified in September before a closed session of the Senate Judiciary Committee about the meeting, which he cast as simply an opportunity to learn about Clinton\'s "fitness, character or qualifications," insisting to investigators that he did not collude with Russia to hurt Clinton\'s campaign.The Senate intelligence committee also hopes to interview Trump Jr. before the end of the year.British publicist Rob Goldstone, who is believed to have arranged that meeting, will reportedly talk to members of the House and Senate intelligence committees as early as next week.Kushner has spoken to both intelligence committees. The panels have also interviewed Ike Kaveladze, who was at the meeting as a representative of a Russian developer who once partnered with Trump to bring the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow, and Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist. A translator who was in attendance has also spoken to congressional investigators.Lawmakers were also expected to ask Trump Jr. about his communications with WikiLeaks during and after the campaign. Last month, Trump Jr. released a series of private Twitter exchanges with WikiLeaks dating to the period during and after the 2016 election.In the exchanges -- including some around the time WikiLeaks was releasing stolen emails from Clinton’s campaign chairman -- Trump Jr. is asked to release his father’s tax returns to the site.The private messages also show Trump Jr. responding to the WikiLeaks account three times.He also asked the site about a rumor about an upcoming leak. The messages began in September 2016 and ran through the following July.Trump Jr. played down the exchanges as he released them.“Here is the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak,” he tweeted. “How ironic!”Trump Jr.’s lawyers had already released the exchanges to the congressional committees investigating Russian intervention.In an Oct. 3, 2016, message, the WikiLeaks Twitter account sent Trump Jr. an article that included critical comments Clinton had made about site editor Julian Assange and said, “It\'d be great if you guys could comment on/push this story.”Trump Jr. replied: “Already did that earlier today. It’s amazing what she can get away with.”Two minutes later, Trump Jr. sent another message: “What’s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?”Longtime Trump associate Roger Stone had tweeted the day that“Hillary Clinton is done,” referencing WikiLeaks.The WikiLeaks Twitter account never responded, but days later WikiLeaks started rolling out emails from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta’s account. After the release, WikiLeaks sent Trump Jr. a searchable link of the emails. Trump Jr. tweeted that link two days later, on Oct. 14, 2016, according to The Atlantic magazine.Fox News\' Joseph Weber and The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'The Lecture That Donald Trump Needs - The New York TimesI’m thrilled that Jeff Sessions is such an evangelist for free speech.Now if only he could convert his boss.On Tuesday afternoon, with much fanfare, Sessions strode onto a stage at Georgetown University and decried the rise of a creature with an insatiable appetite for affirmation, a distressing inability to respect the other side and an ugly impulse to silence anyone who dwells there. He meant today’s college student. He could have been describing today’s president.While decency and decorum are dying in this administration, irony and hypocrisy thrive: Sessions’ defense of the First Amendment came just days after Donald Trump needlessly went to war against professional athletes who were exercising the very rights it protects. When pressed on this dissonance in a question-and-answer period after his remarks, Sessions simply refused to recognize it. He fell unswervingly in line with Trump, contradictions be damned. To serve in this administration is a transcendently speech-freeing thing.There’s no dispute that many campuses are illiberal enclaves of bluntly enforced groupthink, and there’s no doubt that many students deserve the stern words that Sessions aimed at them. But they’re still green and still growing. What’s Trump’s excuse?Given his office and capacity for destruction, he needs the lecture that Sessions delivered most of all. So let’s redirect it from its intended audience to its ideal one, from the ivory tower to Trump Tower, and look at Sessions’ remarks through the prism of his ruler.“There are those who will say that certain speech isn’t deserving of protection. They will say that some speech is hurtful — even hateful … But the right of free speech does not exist only to protect the ideas upon which most of us agree.”Bull’s eye, bingo and hallelujah. The right of free speech protects whatever Colin Kaepernick has to say and whatever he intended to communicate by kneeling during the national anthem. Trump may not be fond of that particular gesture. I myself never was. And as Sessions correctly noted, the president is free to make those thoughts known.But he went so much further, exhorting team owners in the National Football League to fire players who didn’t listen to the anthem and salute the flag in the manner that Trump would like. The First Amendment says that the government mustn’t prohibit free expression, and his campaign against pro athletes, threatening them with the loss of their livelihoods, edges up to that territory.“As Justice Robert Jackson once explained, ‘If there is a fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion.’ ”Our highest official is also our pettiest, and his attack on athletes smacks of such an attempted prescription. So did the statement of his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, that the ESPN host Jemele Hill’s characterization of the president as a “white supremacist” constituted a “fire-able offense.” That’s between ESPN and Hill. The government — meaning the White House — shouldn’t be getting involved.And Trump’s onetime suggestion that flag burning be made a crime: How does that square with the constitution’s fixed star?“A shelter for fragile egos.”That’s how Sessions portrayed the college campus. Make “egos” singular and the phrase defines the Oval Office now. This president has such an overweening investment in his own glory, or rather in the illusion of it, that he distorts truth (the size of his inauguration crowd) and invents facts (the voter fraud that supposedly gave Hillary Clinton the popular vote) to sustain it.As news organizations call him out on these and all of his other lies, he doesn’t merely push back at the stories one by one. He tweets and bleats that the media is an “enemy of the American people,” trafficking in “fake news.” He tries to intimidate given reporters and news organizations.He has called for changes in the law to make it easier to sue news organizations for libel. At rallies, he has encouraged crowds to rant at reporters. On Twitter, he has shared violent imagery in regard to CNN.No president in my lifetime has so thoroughly rejected the media’s role as a vital pillar of democracy and so assertively sought to discredit it as an institution. Freedom of the press is mentioned snug alongside freedom of speech in Sessions’ beloved First Amendment, but you’d never know it from Trump’s behavior.“The university is supposed to be the place where we train virtuous citizens.”The White House is supposed to be the place to which we elevate the most virtuous ones of all, at least in happy theory. But can you show me the honor in a president who warps reality itself to his advantage and savages all who get in the way? And where in that ruthlessness is respect for the lofty principles that Sessions so disingenuously espoused?Administration, heal thyself.', 'Spain, Harvey Weinstein, Donald Trump: Your Thursday Briefing - The New York Times(Want to get this briefing by email?

Their fellow legislators have silently accepted his outrages in exchange for policies they’ve always wanted.At his inauguration Mr. Trump said his presidency was about “transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American people.” But he and his allies in Congress are transferring power to Wall Street, fossil fuel companies, the chemical industry and other special interests, and are stoking an anti-populist bonfire to incinerate protections for consumers and workers.On Tuesday night the Senate, with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, followed the House in voting to overturn a rule that would have allowed consumers to file class-action lawsuits against banks and other financial institutions, rather than be forced to take their disputes to arbitration. The regulation, created after fraud and malfeasance by those businesses financially ruined thousands of Americans and almost wrecked the world economy, joins a series of Obama-era rules that Congress and Mr. Trump have shredded. Meanwhile, they have taken several actions to benefit the well-off at the expense of average Americans.Mr. Trump signed an executive order allowing insurers to sell skimpy health insurance plans that do not protect people with pre-existing conditions and that will destabilize the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. He also said he would stop making payments to insurers that were authorized by the 2010 law, which will cause companies to increase premiums, hurting middle-class families. His administration shortened the open enrollment period when people can buy insurance policies for next year, and slashed spending on advertising and outreach efforts.The administration made it easier for companies to stop providing no-cost birth control to employees if they have religious or moral objections to doing so. It announced that teenage pregnancy prevention grants would end two years early. Congress repealed an Obama-era rule that forbade states to deny family planning funds to Planned Parenthood.Congress overturned a rule restricting the ability of coal companies to dump their mining debris into streams and other waterways, threatening rural communities, forests and wildlife.The head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, rejected a staff recommendation to ban the pesticide chlorpyrifos, which has been linked to developmental problems in children, and started the process to overturn the Clean Power Plan, the Obama-era proposal to reduce planet-warming emissions from power plants.Congress repealed an Obama-era rule that would have required companies seeking federal contracts of $500,000 or more to disclose and fix serious labor and safety violations. It also struck down an Obama-era rule that would have required employers to keep records of workplace injuries for five years, to make sure employers did not hide such information. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed changes that would weaken a rule intended to limit workers’ exposure to beryllium, an industrial mineral linked to lung damage and estimated to cause about 100 deaths a year.The Education Department has delayed implementation of an Obama-era rule to ensure that for-profit colleges seeking federal funds were preparing students for good jobs and they made sure students’ debt was not too burdensome.Even though Republicans often describe themselves as champions of states’ rights, Congress made it harder for states and local governments to create retirement accounts for workers whose employers do not provide 401(k) accounts and pensions.The Department of Housing and Urban Development delayed by two years a rule that would help poor people in high-cost areas by changing how the value of housing vouchers is calculated.Congress repealed a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that sought to expose and limit corruption by requiring oil and mining companies to disclose payments to foreign governments. Under the direction of a Trump appointee, the Federal Communications Commission has eased the cap on how many local TV stations one company can own — and is considering relaxing it even further — helping the conservative broadcaster Sinclair and limiting the diversity of voices on the nation’s airwaves. Congress overturned an F.C.C. rule requiring telecommunications companies to get consumers’ permission before collecting, using and selling personal information.The House and Senate repealed a regulation that would have barred about 75,000 people suffering from conditions like schizophrenia and psychotic disorders — when such conditions prevent them from managing their own financial affairs — from buying a gun.Still, Republicans in Congress have yet to achieve some of their grandest dreams, like huge tax cuts for the wealthy, and they are counting on Mr. Trump to deliver. Spoilsports like Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, may fret about the small stuff, like, as he said on the Senate floor on Tuesday, “the threats against principles, freedoms and institutions, the flagrant disregard for truth and decency.” But what’s all that compared to a bonanza for special interests?', 'Donald Trump, Catalonia, Nxivm: Your Thursday Briefing - The New York Times(Want to get this briefing by email?

Construction began in 1617, during the reign of King Philip III, who is memorialized by an equestrian statue in the center.The square was built on the site of the market at Plaza del Arrabal, and was later called Plaza de la Constitución, Plaza Real, Plaza de la República and finally Plaza Mayor.The plaza has seen almost as many fires as it has names. It had to be rebuilt after blazes in 1631, 1670 and 1790. It now consists of three stories, nine archways and 237 balconies.The site of bullfights, coronations and executions during the Spanish Inquisition, the plaza is now home to shops, restaurants and an annual Christmas market.Madrid has marked this year’s anniversary with lectures, screenings and music and dance performances. For a few days recently, the plaza was also covered with grass. “I wanted to recover the spirit of that green space,” the artist behind the project, SpY, told El País, citing the plaza’s history as earth and garden.Jennifer Jett contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.This briefing was prepared for the European morning.

If it were up to him, he said, the number would be between zero and one.”It’s becoming clear that Mr. Kelly, who some predicted would be a calming chief of staff for President Trump, is more closely aligned with the president’s hard-line views than anticipated.• Mr. Kelly’s speech last week, in which he criticized a Democratic congresswoman, shouldn’t have surprised anyone, the former defense secretary Leon Panetta said: “As somebody who worked with this guy, a lot of what he got up to say is a reflection of who John Kelly is.”• Hundreds of thousands of Indian farmers have killed themselves in the past 30 years, and climate researchers believe hotter weather has increased crop failures, making the problem worse.“I lost my husband’s life and the harvest,” one woman said.• Our South Asia correspondent teamed up with a video journalist to examine a question confronting many Indians: Should they try to survive where they are, or leave?• Today, the U.S. government is set to release the final batch of secret documents concerning the 1963 assassination of President John F.

Our correspondent, who left Liberia as a 13-year-old refugee, met some voters who have learned to game the system, extracting as much as possible out of politicians.“They used to fool us, so now we fool them,” a motorcycle driver told her._____• The Trump administration announced plans to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature clean power initiative, which will make it nearly impossible for the U.S. to fulfill its commitments under the Paris climate accord.Separately, the hard-line immigration demands that Mr. Trump said he needs to back protections for young undocumented immigrants triggered a furious response from immigration activists. We profiled the man behind the proposal — a 32-year-old presidential adviser, Stephen Miller.Plus, Melania Trump took Mr. Trump’s first wife to task for referring to herself as the first lady._____• Google has found evidence that Russian agents bought ads on its wide-ranging networks in an effort to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.The election was the first time Google allowed ads targeting political affinities, but it offered just two categories — left-leaning and right-leaning.Separately, we looked at why the material Russian operatives used on Facebook was often so effective: A review of hundreds of such posts showed that they often contained recycled content created by Americans. “This is cultural hacking,” one observer said._____• Iceland  has become the least-populous nation to ever qualify for a berth in soccer’s World Cup. Here’s a look at who else advanced in qualifiers for next year’s tournament in Russia.The state of soccer in Qatar, the World Cup host country in 2022, is still very much a work in progress.

An illustrator at a Boston dinner party is said to have drawn a picture of the district that looked like a salamander, and a political term was born.Critics say the drawing of districts should be assigned to an independent or bipartisan commission, which some states and Australia, Britain, Canada and most of Europe have already done. (One exception is France, where the constitutionality of a 2010 redistricting committee was contested by lawmakers.)A bill introduced in Congress this summer would create such a commission and would allow voters to rank lists of House candidates in order of preference instead of vote for only one.One obstacle in the fight against gerrymandering is finding a way to measure it. The Supreme Court’s ruling could invalidate maps in more than 20 states, as well as expose at least a dozen House districts to court challenges.Jennifer Jett contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.This briefing was prepared for the European morning.

Just a day before, many of these same people were enthusiastically casting their ballots for a centrist Democrat; suddenly they were self-styled revolutionaries.The day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration saw enormous protests across the country that incorporated a panoply of groups and interests. For those of us on the left, the millions of protesters in pink hats and the dads toting funny signs was a promising sight: Could this be the moment that liberals were converted into radicals?The years since the 2008 financial crisis have seen a wave of protest movements, including Occupy, Black Lives Matter and immigrant rights campaigns. What’s different now — and what’s encouraging — is that new people are getting involved, those for whom the status quo before Mr. Trump’s arrival in the White House didn’t necessarily seem so bad.But the resistance can’t just adopt the symbols and language of revolutionaries. It has to involve the whole package — including radical leadership and ideas. To win meaningful victories, the resistance needs to look beyond the White House or even Congress, and toward solutions that attack inequality and injustice at its roots. That will require not just energy and money but also listening to and working with activists who have been resisting since long before Mr. Trump arrived on the political scene and who might have opinions far to the left of the Democratic Party.Mr. Trump — like right-wing populists across Europe — rode into power on waves of discontent with unaccountable globalization and growing inequality that have increased even under liberal and social-democratic parties. As the French economist Thomas Piketty demonstrated in “Capital in the 21st Century,” inequality’s staggering growth shows no signs of stopping. And it’s pulling democracy apart at the seams; no one but the rich feels represented.The failure of the Democratic Party to reverse this over the past 40 years can’t be overstated, which is precisely why the resistance cannot just be about getting Democrats elected. One of the biggest groups to emerge from the new wave of “resisters” is Indivisible, which was founded by a few liberal former congressional staffers and says it wants to borrow tactics from the Tea Party, as it did when it inspired the raucous protests at town hall meetings that helped turn the tide against Obamacare repeal.This enthusiasm has gotten the traditional Democratic donors and fund-raisers excited: From longstanding groups like Democracy Alliance to liberal tech entrepreneurs, money is pouring into Indivisible and similar organizations. But often these groups have focused on influencing Democrats or getting them elected (sometimes successfully, sometimes not) rather than building a broader movement.The Indivisible activists should be making common cause with another movement that has surged since the election: the Democratic Socialists of America, an activist group that works on both national and local levels, has grown to about 30,000 members from about 5,000 since the election, largely driven by its association with Bernie Sanders, who, though not a member, also identifies as a democratic socialist. (Disclosure: I’m a member.)New members of the D.S.A., most of them millennials, have instinctively recognized the need for radical wealth redistribution, forming what the group’s national director, Maria Svart, calls “the left wing of the resistance.”The D.S.A. — which isn’t a political party — has supported some left-wing candidates across the country, from the Brooklyn City Council to a Virginia House race. But even as it is willing to work with some Democratic candidates or with Democrats on specific issues, its focus is pushing a broader agenda for equality, such as making the case for single-payer health care, while criticizing capitalism itself for driving upward redistribution of wealth. That might make some traditional liberals and Democrats uncomfortable, but in order to resist Mr. Trump, we ought to be thinking about how we ended up with a yawning wealth gap in the first place.If the resistance is going to turn into a vital, sustainable left-wing social movement, it has to build strong relationships and share its resources with the people who are most affected by oppressive economic policies, sexism, xenophobia and racism.“I come from a people who’ve been resisting for the past several centuries in this country,” Charlene Carruthers told me recently when we discussed activism since the election. Ms. Carruthers is the national director of Black Youth Project 100, a racial justice organization for black youth founded in Chicago and active in a dozen states. The best first step after a shock like the election isn’t just to throw yourself into a churn of activity, Ms. Carruthers said, but to “listen to the people who aren’t shocked.”Among the many activists I’ve spoken with in recent weeks, racial justice organizers have been the most nonplused about liberals’ newfound sense of urgency. Many of the people they see taking stands against Mr. Trump are the same who have shown little respect for their issues and communities in the past. Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago, is a perfect example: He declared his city a “Trump-free zone” after the president’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It might be good optics, but his mayorship has been anything but progressive on issues like policing, labor unions and schools.***THE ELECTION HAS GALVANIZED activists of all kinds. After Hillary Clinton’s poor performance with working-class white voters, many on the left have realized that this constituency deserves more of its attention. I spoke recently to Kate Hess Pace, who founded Hoosier Action in her home state of Indiana, a membership organization for working-class Indianans who, with the decline of unions, have few ways of influencing politics. The group has brought members to Washington to lobby their senators on health care, among other actions. Ms. Pace says that most of the people she talks to in Indiana don’t hate Democrats or Republicans, but “outsiders,” people in Washington who have caused their state’s decline.Some new members of the resistance may have people they can turn to easily for guidance: their kids. The radical movements calling attention to inequality and racism well before Mr. Trump’s election — from Occupy to the movement for black lives to a growing interest in socialism to the Dreamers protests — have been driven by millennials. And these movements are eager to grow.There’s a reason that young people were taking up activism and protest years before “President Donald Trump” was a phrase anyone could imagine: Racism, sexism and inequality are nothing new. Mr. Trump’s election just ripped the polite veneer off American politics. In the process, I hope, he’s woken up a lot more people to the deep problems in our society.“Many people that become deeply discontent with the status quo have some moment in their lives when all of a sudden they realize that what they’ve been taught are lies,” said Stuart McIntyre, a 27-year-old activist with the Ohio Organizing Collaborative, an umbrella group with much of the membership coming from black-led organizations in Ohio’s cities that has also seen an influx of new members since the election. “In my experience, a lot of people of color have that ‘mirror moment’ when they’re children. Among left-wing groups, a lot of people maybe have that moment in college. But for a lot of middle-class people, and for a lot of white Americans, that mirror moment is actually happening right now.” That’s a good thing.“I’m looking for converts rather than for traitors,” Mr. McIntyre said. “I want our movement to be as big as possible.”', 'The Self-Dealing Presidency of Donald Trump - The New York TimesIf Donald Trump thinks there’s nothing wrong with exploiting the presidency for his personal profit, he should read the Constitution.That’s the argument plaintiffs made in a Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, in the first-ever lawsuit to accuse a president of violating the emoluments clauses — once-obscure constitutional provisions that the nation’s founders adopted to prevent corruption of public officials.One clause prohibits officials from accepting “any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever” from foreign governments unless Congress approves; another bars presidents from getting payments from federal or state governments other than their salaries.The emoluments clauses are based on a simple, sound idea — that the nation’s security and well-being are threatened when those entrusted with acting in the public interest use their office for private gain. Until Jan. 20, there was no need to invoke them. Presidents have been generally transparent about their financial holdings, placing assets in blind trusts and releasing their tax returns.Mr. Trump — whose global empire of hotels, real estate, golf courses and other businesses is awash in foreign money — has refused to take those steps. Instead, he has performed in a sort of ethics theater, stepping away from the day-to-day management of the Trump Organization even as he retains his ownership in it. Since the Republican-led Congress appears to have no interest in holding Mr. Trump to account, the federal courts may be the only option.In defending Mr. Trump on Wednesday against claims by some plaintiffs that it was impossible to compete for business against the most powerful man in the world, a Justice Department lawyer played down his pull. “The president is a market participant,” said Brett Shumate, a deputy assistant attorney general. “He is not controlling access to the market.” But his participation in the market is part of the problem: Americans shouldn’t have to worry that their leader’s primary allegiance is to his own financial fortunes.Mr. Trump gives little reason to feel reassured. In 2015, he said of Saudi Arabia: “I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me.” He added: “They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them?” (On his first overseas trip after taking office, to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump lavished praise on the kingdom’s rulers, dismissing concerns about their repressive policies.)Meanwhile, foreign officials are racing to curry favor with our businessman in chief. Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, one diplomat told The Washington Post, “Why wouldn’t I stay at his hotel, blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, ‘I love your new hotel!’ ”The case being heard Wednesday was filed days after Mr. Trump took office by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, a bipartisan watchdog group. CREW’s complaint highlights the conflicts between Mr. Trump’s duties as president and his “vast, complicated and secret” web of business interests. These include Trump Tower in New York, where foreign-government-held entities like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China hold leases that will come up for renewal during Mr. Trump’s term, and the Trump International Hotel in Washington, where foreign diplomats pay top dollar to sleep, eat and do business with the United States. (Elected federal officials, including the president, are prohibited from holding the lease to the hotel, but that’s another story.)Since the emoluments suit was filed, plaintiffs who complained of unfair competition in the hospitality industry have joined in. Meanwhile, two separate federal suits have also charged Mr. Trump with violating the emoluments clauses — one by nearly 200 Democratic members of Congress and the other by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia.A central question for the courts is the meaning of “emoluments.” Does the term cover only those benefits given in exchange for an official’s “personal services,” as the White House contends? Or does it apply to “anything of value” an official receives, as the plaintiffs argue? At Wednesday’s hearing, Judge George Daniels of Federal District Court appeared sympathetic to a broader reading, but was skeptical that the plaintiffs have standing to bring the lawsuit, because they had not shown concrete ways that Mr. Trump’s actions had directly harmed them.Even if the case is thrown out on those grounds, Mr. Trump is still a walking emoluments-clause violation. And he still refuses to release his tax returns and other financial records, preventing the public from seeing the full extent of his business entanglements, debts and interests.In this light it’s hard to see how the American people can ever be confident that Mr. Trump, who has spent a lifetime as a money-obsessed deal maker, is acting in the nation’s best interest, and not his own.', 'Donald Trump, Syria, Migrants: Your Tuesday Briefing - The New York Times(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.Here’s what you need to know:• The U.S. military provided the fullest explanation so far from the Trump administration about a deadly ambush in Niger this month that killed four American and four Nigerien soldiers. It is still unclear why the soldiers waited one hour before they called for help.President Trump took to Twitter to reject criticism by the widow of one of those killed in the ambush. She said that Mr. Trump had blundered through his condolence call to her, struggling to remember her husband’s name. We collected reactions on the controversy from the American left and right.Separately on Twitter, Mr. Trump effectively halted a plan that Republicans were considering to help pay for a $1.5 trillion tax cut._____• In Syria, an apparent mass killing of dozens of civilians is the latest example of the brutal reprisals that have taken place when territory changes hands in the country’s multisided war. The carnage also showed how the Islamic State could still spread havoc.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, above, slipped into Iraq on Monday night after having spent the morning at a U.S. military base in Afghanistan. The competing interests awaiting him in Baghdad have turned the trip into a diplomatic minefield.Meanwhile the Philippines declared an end to months of warfare against Islamic State-inspired militants in the city of Marawi, but fears linger that remaining groups of militants will strike again._____• Most European Union member countries backed a French proposal to overhaul temporary labor migration rules that have pitted Western members against Central and Eastern peers. (Above, Emmanuel Macron, the French president.)Labor ministers debated a compromise that would set a time limit for E.U. citizens working in other member countries before they fall under the host country’s labor laws. Poland and Hungary are among the countries opposed to new restrictions.Meanwhile, Victor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, used his speech commemorating the 61st anniversary of the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising to rail against migration from outside the bloc._____• In South Africa, apartheid persists economically. That reality, our correspondent writes, is palpable in Cape Town’s townships.Protesters demand the ouster of President Jacob Zuma over disclosures of corruption so high-level that it is often described as state capture. The economy keels in recession, worsening an official unemployment rate reaching nearly 28 percent.“The patterns of enrichment and impoverishment are still the same,” a radio host said._____• Finally, a startling experimental medical procedure: Doctors lifted a woman’s womb above her body to mend a child’s birth defect — before birth.Our reporter witnessed the three-hour surgery in Texas. Doctors are hopeful. The mother’s due date is Jan. 14.• E.U. antitrust investigators searched the offices of Daimler and Volkswagen as part of an inquiry into allegations of illegal collusion by Germany’s car giants. BMW headquarters were searched last week.• China’s antipollution effort has grown so intense that it could dampen global economic recovery.• “Davos in the Desert:” Executives are making their pitches in Saudi Arabia this week to diversify the kingdom’s oil-based economy.• Many American manufacturing jobs are gone, but some U.S. cities have replaced them with new ones at vast warehouses used by online retailers.•  Here’s a snapshot of global markets.• Catalonia’s regional government warned that its civil servants would defy orders from the Spanish government if Madrid decided later this week to enforce direct rule. Above, the room where Spanish senators are set to deliberate over suspending Catalan autonomy. [Reuters]• In Moscow, a knife-wielding man broke into the studio of Echo of Moscow, a prominent talk-radio station, and stabbed a journalist, Tatyana Felgenhauer, in the throat. The station said her injuries were not life-threatening.

We are looking to hire at least one ambitious traveling correspondent to turn our annual 52 Places to Go wish list into an itinerary. Here’s how to apply.The Olympic torch was lit today in Greece, beginning the countdown to the next Winter Games.The flame will travel more than 5,000 miles east to South Korea, arriving Nov. 1 — 100 days before the 2018 Olympics begin.Starting in the city of Incheon, the torch will cross South Korea, with stops in nine provinces and eight major cities before arriving in Pyeongchang for the opening ceremony on Feb. 9.The torch lighting goes back to the ancient games, but the Olympic flame made its first modern appearance at the 1928 Games in Amsterdam. The relay began with the 1936 Games in Berlin.The torch itself is designed by the host country. The Times noted in 2010: “The modern Olympic Games have become as much a global contest among designers and architects as among athletes. Each Olympics is expected to produce a logo, a signature building — and a characteristic torch that symbolizes local tradition and national character.”The torch for the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul featured a bright metal body and Korean graphic elements. The five-pronged shape of the 2018 torch represents the Korean symbol for Pyeongchang.Inyoung Kang contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.This briefing was prepared for the European morning.

Two very different, very intense debates are dominating the news.First, how did President Trump’s condolence call to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson go so far off the rails? Above, his coffin. The administration has been swept up into a feud that pits Mr. Trump and his chief of staff, John Kelly, against Frederica Wilson, a Democratic congresswoman who sharply criticized the call as insensitive.The bitter exchanges raised new questions about exactly how Sergeant Johnson died. The Pentagon and, unusually, the F.B.I. are investigating the conflicting accounts surrounding the Oct. 4 ambush in Niger that claimed his life, along with those of three other Americans and four Nigerien soldiers.____2. The second sweeping phenomenon: the groundswell over sexual harassment, which has spread far beyond Hollywood.The undoing of Harvey Weinstein underscored the increasing gravity of women’s accusations. Big-name actresses like the Oscar winner Lupita Nyong’o, above, have come forward with long-withheld accounts of his behavior. “Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing,” she writes in an Op-Ed.Actresses like Jennifer Lawrence and Reese Witherspoon discussed other perpetrators, and hundreds of thousands of women posted #MeToo messages.In California’s capital, more than 140 women — including legislators and lobbyists — denounced pervasive sexual misconduct in the legislature. France, after a #MeToo-style outburst, is considering fines for catcalls.And The Times reported a previously undisclosed sixth settlement over sexual harassment allegations against Bill O’Reilly, the former Fox News host. A month after the $32 million deal in January, Fox extended his contract.____3. Meanwhile, the wheels of government are turning, if slowly. Republicans, still striving for a single marquee legislative achievement in the Trump presidency, narrowly secured Senate approval for a budget blueprint paving the way for a $1.5 trillion tax cut.The House takes it up this week, shadowed by news from the Treasury Department: the largest annual budget deficit in four years.Republicans aim to pass the tax bill by Christmas, but few on or off Capitol Hill have seen even a draft. Here are the mechanics of the effort.____4. Senator Mitch McConnell and President Trump made a show of togetherness, moving to fill scores of federal court vacancies with conservatives. Above, Mr. McConnell, center left, with Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado.On health care, Mr. Trump walked back his endorsement of a bipartisan effort to save insurance subsidies. Conversely, the I.R.S. announced a move that would bolster Obamacare: It will enforce the individual mandate, declining 2017 tax returns that do not disclose the filer’s health insurance status.At the same time, the E.P.A. has been moving to ease restrictions on toxic chemicals, under the direction of a former industry lobbyist.____5. Without speaking President Trump’s name, two former presidents, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, in separate speeches implicitly condemned the president and the powers that thrust him into office. “Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry and compromises the moral education of children,” Mr. Bush said.And George Soros, the billionaire hedge fund manager and a major Democratic donor, revealed that he had transferred $18 billion to his Open Society Foundations. A lightning rod for conservative critics, he is now squarely in the middle of the social and political debates convulsing the country.____6. Disaster recovery continues: A month after Hurricane Maria, 80 percent of Puerto Rico remains without electricity. “We need trucks, we need poles, we need crews, we need lines, we need more people,” said a local utility employee.In Northern California, some businesses are reopening as investigators dig through debris to determine what set off the region’s staggering outbreak of wildfires, whose toll includes 40 lives and almost 8,000 structures. The findings will help decide who pays for damages that are estimated to have surpassed $1 billion.The mass shooting in Las Vegas continues to mystify investigators. Using forensic analysis, we mapped 30 videos on a timeline to reconstruct the attack minute by minute, above, drawing perhaps the most complete picture to date of what happened when Stephen Paddock rained an estimated 900 rounds onto concertgoers.____7. Abroad, Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, in an unexpectedly forceful move, said he would seek the removal of Catalonia’s leader, Carles Puigdemont, to halt the region’s secessionist movement.The question of independence is particularly complex in Barcelona, which is divided between its identity as a global city and as Catalonia’s capital._____8. In the Middle East, our photographer accompanied some of the U.S.-backed forces that drove the Islamic State from its de facto capital, Raqqa, Syria. That capped the group’s ouster from most of Syria and Iraq, but at the cost of unfathomable destruction. Above, fighters in Raqqa.And counterterrorism officials say ISIS could morph into a new, lethal incarnation.To the west, the Iraqi military vanquished Kurdish forces to reclaim Kirkuk, checking the Kurds’ move toward independence. The U.S., despite its long reliance on the Kurds in the fight against ISIS, sat by,  lining up with Iran’s priorities.____9. While world attention has been on North Korea’s nuclear program, the country has nurtured a secretive hard-currency trade that nets $1 billion annually, and built a cyberwar program capable of stealing millions and unleashing global havoc.Elsewhere on the world stage, Nikki Haley, President Trump’s U.N. ambassador, made strident denunciations of Iran and urged tougher action by the Security Council against its “outlaw behavior.”(She also received something of a tutorial on statecraft at a panel discussion with the former secretaries of state Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine Albright.)____10. In Africa, some are referring to the twin truck bombings in Mogadishu that killed more than 270 people as Somalia’s 9/11.Kenyans are on edge as the redo of their presidential election approaches on Thursday. The warring between parties led an official to say that the repeat might not be credible, either.In West Africa, a health implication resulting from the 2013-16 Ebola outbreak is shocking doctors: Many survivors have cataracts, even children as young as 5. Above, a child preparing to undergo eye surgery in Sierra Leone.____11. President Xi Jinping’s dominance in China has been on display at the Communist Party congress, which culminates this week with a reshuffle of the powerful Politburo.Here are the five takeaways from Mr. Xi’s marathon, 205-minute opening speech, which projected military and economic power.And the extraordinary security clampdown on Beijing for the congress further emphasized his message: Nothing can stand in my way.____12. The Houston Astros are back. They face the Dodgers in L.A. on Tuesday for Game 1 of the World Series.The Yankees lost the chance Saturday night, after the Astros — celebrating above — held them to three hits and no runs to win the American League Championship Series.Lance McCullers Jr. spun curve after curve — 24 in a row to end the game._____13. Finally, ready for a bit of escapism? For those who stream, here are 11 underappreciated TV shows now on Hulu. For those who’d rather scream, “The Walking Dead” returns tonight for Season 8. Here’s a look back at where the horror series left off.For a more erudite diversion, curl up with George Saunders’s experimental first novel, “Lincoln in the Bardo,” which just won the Man Booker Prize, or this year’s T Magazine Greats issue. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, above, a defining voice on race and gender for the digital age, is featured.Have a great week._____Your Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Evening Briefing, weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern.Want to look back?

So the role was offered to Mark Cuban and Trump’s lawyer threatened to sue, the producer told The Hollywood Reporter.Cuban ended up in the cinematic White House with the sharks circling, and Ann Coulter as his veep, and Trump ended up in the real White House with the sharks circling, and Ann Coulter as his frenemy.“I think it’s funny as hell, yeah,” Cuban says with a grin.Maybe deploying a shotgun and grenades to save the White House from a shower of sharks — while simultaneously starring on “Shark Tank” — gave Cuban the scent of chum in the Potomac. He puts the odds that he will challenge his fellow loud billionaire, master salesman and reality TV star in 2020 at 10 percent — “maybe 11.”“I’m considering it, yes,” he tells me. “I would put the odds against it right now for family reasons, but there is still plenty of time.”A few weeks after Trump took office, The New York Post reported that Steve Bannon had identified Cuban as the No. 1 threat for 2020 because he could appeal to Republicans and independents.“Bannon is a smart man,” smiles Cuban, who has huddled with the strategist.I met the voluble owner of the Dallas Mavericks at Jean-Georges in the Trump hotel at Columbus Circle, where he keeps an apartment. It seemed a bit dicey to be discussing a possible coup at the same elegant eatery where the president-elect tortured Mitt Romney by dangling the secretary of state job over sautéed frogs’ legs.But Cuban is nothing if not brazen. He ambles into the three-star Michelin restaurant in his usual jeans and Adidas kicks, wearing a T-shirt someone had sent him that read “Stronger Than Lions.”When I ask if he would run as an independent, he replies: “Probably, or a Republican. I’m registered as an independent. I mean, I’d rather do it as an independent.” But running as an independent has not proved successful in modern times. You just become a spoiler like Ross Perot. (Who is Cuban’s neighbor in Dallas, along with W.)Cuban epitomizes a tantalizing question: Will Trump’s election open the floodgates to celebrities who are thinking, “Wow, if that dude can do it…,” and who can titillate the media by delivering what Cuban calls “headline porn,” or will it send voters scurrying back to more traditional pols?The 59-year-old, who got rich with one of the first online streaming companies, has been described as “Trump without the crazy.” He calls Trump batty but has also written that it’s good to have “the edge,” when “people think you’re crazy and they are right, but you don’t care what they think.”He gives free rein to his goofball side. He once bought a six-month supply of toilet paper at a store in Dallas to hedge against inflation. “I order 36 tubes of Theodent toothpaste at a time and they just stack up,” he says. “When I buy razor blades, I buy a load of them because it doesn’t take much space and they’re expensive.”He also confesses to having been naked in front of his computer, hitting the refresh button, waiting for his stock price to reach the point where he was a billionaire — a moment recreated by Cuban’s mentally unhinged doppelgänger on HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” Russ Hanneman.“Look, there are people who are saying we don’t need another business person,” he says, sipping iced tea. “But it’s about what you do with it, what you learn, what you can contribute and what value you can add. I’d want to come in with proof of an agenda, ‘Here’s a health care solution and I’ve already paid my own money to have it scored.’“They always say that people vote against what they didn’t like about the previous president, right? And I think he’s so ineffective, people will look for somebody who can get something done who’s not a politician. If that’s a celebrity, that’s just an easier platform to work from. The best example is tax reform, right?”He says he would call the top 5,000 profitable companies and say: If I’m going to give you a 20 percent corporate tax rate, I’m going to need a commitment from you that you’re going to increase the wages of your lowest-paid workers.“If you did that,” he says, “you’d be a hero.”Asked if he would send the Mavericks’ former player Dennis Rodman to negotiate with Little Rocket Man, he replies, “Why not?”Trump and Cuban are testosterone twins in some ways. Both savor poking elites and flouting convention. Both have owned sports teams and love making movie and TV cameos. Both say the government has conspired against them, Trump with the Deep State and Cuban when he fended off insider-trading charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2008.But Cuban is more charitable. He recently lent his jet to the Mavericks’ point guard J. J. Barea to take emergency supplies to Puerto Rico. He is also fairer in business. Forbes said that on “Shark Tank,” Cuban had the best record of following through with the terms of a deal.He is more reflective than Trump. In a 2012 blog post, he wrote that he regretted cracking a gay joke in an interview: “I think being the person I want to be includes not blurting out throwaway jokes about sexuality, race, ethnicity, size, disability or other things people have no say in about themselves.”In 2014 he came under pressure for a comment perceived as racially insensitive, saying while discussing bigotry, “If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it’s late at night, I’m walking to the other side of the street,” and if he sees a white guy who “has tattoos all over his face,” he’d do the same. He apologized to the family of Trayvon Martin.But Cuban can empathize with Trump. “If you just put on the eyes of a sales guy and an entrepreneur who struggled a lot, that’s Donald Trump,” Cuban says. “He’s overselling all the time. Most people when they sell, they try to solve problems. Donald Trump is not a problem solver. Never was. Never will be. To Donald Trump, people are fungible. Where’s the list of entrepreneurs who say, ‘He mentored me, he helped me, he invested in me’?”I note that Trump has trolled us both on Twitter, calling me a “neurotic dope” and Cuban an “arrogant, crude, dope” who is “not smart enough to run for president.”“There are three Donald Trumps,” he says. “Donald Trump, the president. Donald Trump, the salesperson. Donald Trump, the troll. Trolls are going to troll.” Trump’s Twitter personality, Cuban says, is just like a guy “screaming at a sporting event.” (He himself has paid the N.B.A. hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines for screaming courtside.)Cuban said during the primaries that he would accept a position as Hillary’s running mate or Trump’s. “I wasn’t a Hillary fan, by the way,” he says, but he was less of a Donald fan, so he campaigned for her and sat in the front row for the first debate.Cuban likes to say whining is underrated, but what did he think of Hillary blaming Comey, Sanders, Obama, Biden, Putin?“They didn’t see it coming at all,” he says of the arrogant Clinton camp. “I remember right before the election, they invited me to the party in Brooklyn. I’m like, are you kidding me? You do not plan the parade before you win the championship.“In sports, matchups matter, right? Hillary was prepared to have a policy-against-policy matchup against a politician. She was not prepared to have a matchup against a movement.”He scoffs: “The Russians had no effect on the election. Look, if you spotted Donald Trump two pieces of bread and behind him was a refrigerator full of ham, he couldn’t collude with the Russians to make a ham sandwich. Right?”Since both he and Trump had shows produced by Mark Burnett, I wonder if Cuban had ever pressed the producer to hand over that alleged compilation tape from “The Apprentice” with Trump’s sexist and racist comments. Yes, Cuban says, but Burnett told him he didn’t have such a tape.His friendly relations with Trump frayed amid the campaign trolling. “Last time I talked to him was via email when he asked me why I went negative on him,” Cuban says. “And I sent him an email back saying, ‘At some point, you have to learn the issues.’ Does he really understand the ins and outs of health care? No, he mixes health insurance up with life insurance, right?” He sent Trump a congratulations email after he got elected, but has had no further contact.Still, he says he would serve as a tech adviser to the White House if asked. “If China and Russia are able to advance their A.I. further than ours,” he says, “they’re going to kick our ass.”Cuban always says he’s lucky and his anthem is Joe Walsh’s “Life’s Been Good.” He lives in a Dallas mansion with five wet bars, three kids and his wife, Tiffany, whom he describes as a “smart, funny and beautiful” and “a badass.” His wife lets him live like Tom Hanks in “Big.” “We’ve got a basketball dribble machine and there is a basketball court in the ballroom,” he says.He did well, I say, with his samba to the “I Dream of Jeannie” theme on “Dancing With the Stars,” especially given that he had just had hip replacement surgery.“I told my wife,” he says, “I don’t want to look back and say I would’ve, could’ve, should’ve.”Maybe that’s what Cuban is thinking about 2020.', 'Catalonia, Kurds, Donald Trump: Your Monday Briefing - The New York Times(Want to get this briefing by email?

(They were the Brooklyn Dodgers then. They moved to Los Angeles in 1957.)He made his major-league debut on April 15, 1947, an experience he described in his autobiography:“I had to fight hard against loneliness, abuse and the knowledge that any mistake I made would be magnified because I was the only black man out there. Many people resented my impatience and honesty, but I never cared about acceptance as much as I cared about respect.”He was a huge star, becoming rookie of the year and drawing enormous crowds. He stole home in Game 1 of the 1955 World Series, helping the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees for their first championship. Above, Robinson sliding into second base in the 1947 World Series.After retiring, he became a prosperous businessman and was influential in politics. He died on Oct. 24, 1972, of a heart attack.

We have guessed the password. It is ‘putintrump.’ See ‘About’ for who is behind it. Any comments?”Trump Jr. replied, “Off the record I don’t know who that is, but I’ll ask around. Thanks.”In a separate October 2016 exchange, WikiLeaks urged Trump Jr. to “comment on/push this story” about then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wanting to “just drone” Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder.“Already did that earlier today,” Trump Jr. later replied. “It’s amazing what she can get away with.”The messages obtained by The Atlantic were turned over to investigators by Trump Jr.’s attorneys. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence had access to the documents, a source told Fox News.“Over the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests,” Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., said in a statement.“Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.”According to the report, the messages are part of a long correspondence between WikiLeaks and Trump Jr., though Trump Jr. seemed to ignore many of the messages, including some which urged him to release “one or more of your father’s tax returns.”President Trump’s attorney Ty Cobb told Fox News on Monday that he was not aware that Donald Trump Jr.’s attorneys provided these documents to congressional investigators, but said there is likely no legal issue, from what he knows of the documents.Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange tweeted about the report on Monday, saying that the organization couldn’t “confirm” the messages with Trump Jr.Wikileaks “does not keep such records and the Atlantic’s presentation is edited and clearly does not have the full context,” Assange wrote.I cannot confirm the alleged DM\'s from @DonaldJTrumpJr to @WikiLeaks. @WikiLeaks does not keep such records and the Atlantic\'s presentation is edited and clearly does not have the full context.

On Saturday, 18 states across the country and thousands of volunteers are participating in the RNC’s “National Day of Action,” mobilizing in support of the Republican Party and President Trump’s winning agenda. We will bring together volunteers and equip them with skills to reach voters more effectively. Following their training, they will go out into their communities and put their new-found skills to work. These “rock star” volunteers bolster our ground game efforts and are eager to give their time and energy in order to spread our Party’s message of opportunity, prosperity, and freedom.This is part of the RNC’s multi-year effort to establish a permanent, uninterrupted presence in states across the country. The plan worked well during the 2016 cycle and, because we never left these states, was a big reason the Party went undefeated in four special elections. This same on-the-ground strategy enabled us to invest nearly 100 people and millions of dollars in Virginia, which is proving to be critical in an extremely close governor’s race.Our flagship Republican Leadership Initiative (RLI) Program helps us recruit, organize, and mobilize volunteers who then expand our footprint – and our majorities -- nationwide.Just today, 1000 new RLI Fellows are being trained across 18 states at over 100 locations. The volunteers who graduate from this program become our voices on the ground, and spread the conservative message across the country.That’s why the RLI Program is critical to our mission: it allows us to foster deeper relationships with state parties, elected officials, local leaders, and community groups. All of this begins with our dedicated volunteers. By driving our engagement and outreach efforts, they ensure the success of our Party.If you pass by a group of spirited volunteers in their red “National Day of Action” t-shirts this Saturday, give them a wave, take a minute to chat with them, or better yet, join us!Ronna Romney McDaniel is Chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.', '                                    U.S. President Donald Trump and Japan\'s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe greet one another at Kasumigaseki Country Club outside Tokyo, Nov. 5, 2017.

Still, the two men have struck up an easy rapport.Their formal talks are set to begin Monday in Tokyo. Abe will be looking for a united front against North Korea and reassurances that the U.S. will stand by its treaty obligations to defend Japan if falls under attack.Eager to forge a bond with Tokyo\'s crucial ally, Abe was one of the first world leaders to court President-elect Trump. He was the first to call Trump after the election, and rushed to New York days later to meet the president-elect and present him with a pricey, gold Honma golf driver.The two men also met on the sidelines of an international summit in Italy this spring and White House officials said Trump has spoken with Abe by phone more than any world leader, aside from British Prime Minister Theresa May.That bond was clear Sunday, as Trump and Abe exchanged glowing tweets about their game. Trump dubbed Abe and pro golfer Hideki Matsuyama -- who accompanied the two leaders -- as "wonderful people," while Abe called it a "round of golf with a marvelous friend."Playing golf with Prime Minister Abe and Hideki Matsuyama, two wonderful people! pic.twitter.com/vYLULe0o2KFrom the time Marine One landed on the Kasumigaseki Country Club\'s driving range, Abe rolled out little touches to make Trump feel welcome. He presented a hat that had a version of Trump\'s campaign theme, this time reading "Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater."The two passed up the region\'s famed Kobe beef in favor of the American version, which is favored by Trump, a famed picky eater.When Trump hosted Abe in Palm Beach, Fla., earlier this year, they played at one of Trump\'s golf courses. For that outing, Trump brought along pro golfer Ernie Els, so this time Abe matched him by bringing along Matsuyama, whom Trump described on the plane ride to Asia as "probably the greatest player in the history of Japan." Abe was behind the wheel of a golf cart as the two men were spotted moving from hole to hole, Trump in the passenger seat smiling and waving at those they passed. 素晴らしい友人とのゴルフ。会話も弾みます。A round of golf with a marvelous friend (President Donald J. Trump), full of spirited conversation.  @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/ZpMrWeWudW"From the point of view of Abe administration, the personal chemistry that exists between the two leaders is seen as an asset," said Mireya Sollis, chair in Japan Studies for the Brookings Center for East Asia Policy Studies.She said that the Japanese believe it is already "seeing it pay off," including when Trump agreed to meet with the families of Japanese citizens kidnapped by the North Korean regime, an important issue for Tokyo.Ever since Saudi Arabia delivered a lavish welcome on Trump\'s first international trip, leaders have tried to outdo themselves to impress the president, who has proven susceptible to flattery.Before the game, Trump delivered a speech in which he hailed Japan as a "crucial ally" and warned adversaries not to test America\'s resolve."Japan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States and today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations," Trump told American service members at Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo.Though Trump did not mention North Korea by name during the speech, the spectre of its weapons program will loom large throughout Trump\'s five-nation Asia trip. The president warned of the consequences of crossing what he called the "most fearsome fighting force in the history of our world.""Together with our allies, America\'s warriors are prepared to defend our nation using the full range of our unmatched capabilities. No one -- no dictator, no regime and no nation -- should underestimate, ever, American resolve," he told the troops.U.S. President Donald Trump and Japan\'s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe display hats bearing the slogan, "Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater."(Associated Press)And while there is worry in the region about Trump\'s unpredictable response to the threat posed by Kim Jong Un, Trump made clear he did not intend to tone down his bellicose rhetoric -- which included dubbing Kim Jong Un as "Little Rocket Man" -- even while in an Asian capital within reach of the North Korea dictator\'s missiles."There\'s been 25 years of total weakness, so we are taking a very much different approach" in dealing with the renegade regime in Pyongyang, he said, speaking to reporters on Air Force One.Trump also said it is "expected" that he\'ll meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of an upcoming summit in Vietnam.The easy rapport with Japan could be strained if Trump takes an aggressive approach on trade or the two men disagree on the need for a diplomatic approach to the threat looming in Pyongyang. During his campaign, Trump suggested Japan should acquire its own nuclear weapons to defend itself, hinted the U.S. might not come to the nation\'s defense, and accused Japan of "killing us" on trade. He has dropped that antagonist language almost entirely since the election, but tensions remain.Japan was a chief proponent of the Trans Pacific Partnership, a trade deal Trump pulled out of.Scott Seaman, a director for Asia of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultant organization, noted: "everything is fine with Trump until you tell him no. So far, Abe hasn\'t told him no."The Associated Press contributed to this story.', 'One year later, Michael Starr Hopkins, Democratic strategist and contributor to The Hill, relives Donald Trump\'s victory in the presidential election.A year ago today, President-elect Donald Trump – perhaps the only politician not shocked by his historic victory – rallied supporters with a vow to apply his bigger-and-better business style to the country as a whole.“America will no longer settle for anything less than the best,” he declared. And after a divisive election, the next commander-in-chief pledged to be “president for all Americans.”Twelve months later, the changes are seismic.It is indisputable that the candidate who ran as the get-things-done, board-room executive was great for Wall Street.The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained nearly 29 percent since Election Day 2016. The S&P 500 is up 21 percent.After a rocky first quarter, economic growth also has picked up to around 3 percent under Trump, while the unemployment rate has dipped from 4.8 percent in January to 4.1 percent.Trump marked his election anniversary Wednesday with a tweet congratulating the "DEPLORABLES" who voted for him.Congratulations to all of the ”DEPLORABLES” and the millions of people who gave us a MASSIVE (304-227) Electoral College landslide victory! pic.twitter.com/7ifv5gT7UrThe Trump team and its allies on Capitol Hill are vowing a bigger economic shot in the armsoon if they can muscle through a massive tax overhaul in the coming weeks and months – aiming to unleash growth by slashing corporate tax rates, simplifying the tax system and boosting the standard deduction.But the deal isn’t yet sealed, and congressional leaders are cautious given their repeated failure to pass an ObamaCare overhaul as promised during the campaign.While the president has struggled to get his legislative agenda passed on Capitol Hill, Trump often boasts of his nomination – and the successful Senate confirmation – of Neil Gorsuch to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court when talking up his accomplishments to conservative audiences.Elsewhere, 12 months of Trump have brought mounting complications.NOT-YET-UNITED STATESIn the days after Trump’s election, Gallup conducted a poll finding a record 77 percent of Americans think the country is divided on key values. The country hasn’t demonstrated much unification since then. Trump’s inauguration was countered with massive protests in cities across the country. Far-left activists have since rioted on college campuses and far-right demonstrators – including neo-Nazis – have taken to the streets, notably in Charlottesville where a counter-protester was killed in August.Moderate Republicans are increasingly speaking out against the president, like Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, who plans to retire.(AP)The president’s scorched-earth approach to politics – largely conducted via his Twitter account – also has fueled divisions on Capitol Hill, where moderate Republicans are increasingly speaking out against the president and bucking the White House on key votes like health care, even when it invites his Twitter wrath. The most outspoken are those, like Sens. Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, who plan to retire.PROBE POLITICSMeanwhile, a backdrop of investigations and grievances over those investigations has kept both sides of the political aisle in an outrage cycle.In a stunning sequence of events that started with Trump’s firing of James Comey at the FBI, Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to investigate Russian meddling in the election and possible collusion with Trump associates. The first indictments were announced last week, though they didn’t speak specifically to campaign collusion with Moscow. The investigation is ongoing, as are related congressional investigations – giving Democrats, especially book-touring Hillary Clinton, a hook for continuing to question the fairness of the 2016 race.Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to investigate Russian meddling in the election and possible collusion with Trump associates.        But Republicans have increasingly countered with allegations of their own, with some even calling for the appointment of a second special counsel to investigate Obama and Clinton-era controversies – including claims that the Clinton email case was mishandled and questions over how much the FBI relied on a research firm that commissioned an unverified anti-Trump dossier. It has recently emerged that the research was funded with help from the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party.IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWNNothing energized Trump’s base during the campaign like his promises to get tough on illegal immigration, build a wall and institute extreme vetting for refugees and others entering the country.The Customs and Border Protection agency recently unveiled prototypes of a new wall design from several contractors.(Reuters)Implementing those policies hasn’t been easy, but the Trump administration has sought to make a hard break from the Obama years: Shortly after taking office in January, the president signed an executive order temporarily banning immigration from several majority-Muslim countries while restricting entry for some Syrian refugees. That led to protests across the country and federal court challenges, which forced the administration to revise the order. The ban expired last month, as the administration keeps pursuing revised rules.Trump also tasked his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, with ramping up enforcement of immigration laws, including cracking down on sanctuary cities by threatening to deny them federal funding. Trump also announced plans to end DACA, the Obama-era executive action protecting young immigrants from deportation, while calling on Congress to pass a remedy. All of this has been complicated by Trump’s public criticism of Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation.The wall along the southern border has yet to be built – and Mexico still insists it won’t pay for it, as Trump promised during the campaign – but the Customs and Border Protection agency recently unveiled prototypes of a new wall design from several contractors.REGULATION ROLLBACKGridlock in Congress has not stopped the president from unraveling former President Barack Obama’s executive action legacy, with Trump portraying his regulatory rollbacks as a boon for business.Gridlock in Congress has not stopped the president from unraveling former President Barack Obama’s executive action legacy.        That includes withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, green-lighting the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines, moving to roll back the Clean Power Plan and using the Congressional Review Act, an obscure rule-killing law, to wipe out a wave of last-minute regulations pushed through before he took office.THE WORLD IS STILL A DANGEROUS PLACEThe president has spent a considerable amount of his time over the last 12 months dealing with threats – at home and abroad.As the Islamic State orchestrated terror attacks and declared a caliphate in Iraq and Syria during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump famously promised during to “bomb the sh-t” out of ISIS. Last month, after the liberation of Raqqa, the president boasted that “more progress” had been made “against these evil terrorists in the past several months than in the past several years.”Tensions with North Korea, however, have escalated since Trump took office, with the president mocking leader Kim Jong Un as “Little Rocket Man” over the country’s nuclear program. During a speech in South Korea this week, the president warned North Korea: “Do not underestimate us. And do not try us." As for the nuclear threat from Iran, Trump announced last month that he would decertify the 2015 Obama-era Iran nuclear deal, while leaving to Congress whether to restore sanctions.President Trump has mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “Little Rocket Man.” (AP)In recent months, the president has flown on Air Force One to sites of deadly disasters in the country, including hurricanes in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. He also traveled to Las Vegas last month after the massacre at a country music festival – the deadliest mass shooting in United States history. Democrats have reiterated their calls for new gun control measures in the wake of more mass shootings, including after the slaughter of a Texas church last weekend, but the NRA-backed president has suggested he has no appetite for restricting the gun ownership of law abiding Americans.ORDER IN THE WEST WING?There’s been no shortage of drama, rivalries and turnover inside the West Wing. Many aides -- including national security adviser Mike Flynn, chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus, press secretary Sean Spicer -- joined the White House at the beginning of the administration but have since been fired or resigned from their positions. Anthony Scaramucci lasted just 10 days in office. And the presence of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as White House aides has complicated dynamics.But some of that drama has calmed since this summer’s selection of retired Marine general and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly for White House chief of staff. Kelly has attempted to bring order to an unruly West Wing environment as the president pushes Congress to pass a tax reform package, a campaign promise Republicans acknowledge having to fulfill after failing so far to repeal ObamaCare.Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has attempted to bring order to an unruly West Wing as chief of staff.        In an op-ed for USA Today on Wednesday marking the anniversary of the election, Vice President Pence argued that tax reform would pass in the Republican-controlled Congress by the end of the year.“It has been a year of accomplishments, and we’re just getting started,” Pence said. “Before this year is out, we’ll pass historic tax cuts for the American people.

Here’s the sign-up.)If there’s a Democratic revolt against the Trump administration, California’s attorney general is arguably one of its more important architects.Since taking the job in January, Xavier Becerra has brought dozens of legal actions against the federal government.He has challenged the travel ban, threats to federal funding, the plan to end the “dreamer” program, changes to health care and environmental policy and, just Wednesday, the proposed border wall.In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Becerra, 59, said he saw his role as one of safeguarding California’s ability to prosper.“California is not looking to pick a fight,” he said. “But if Trump is trying to get in our way, that’s when we go at it.”Attorneys general have the authority to sue on behalf of their state’s residents.With a Republican Congress and White House, Democratic attorneys general across the country have assumed outsize roles on the national stage by using the courts to halt policies that they argue cause harm to their states.In California, the biggest state by population, Mr. Becerra brings more firepower than anyone to the fight. His Department of Justice has more than 4,500 employees and a budget of more than $800 million.“He’s on the front lines. He’s got the budget. He has the position in California government. He’s got access to national media given that it’s California,” said John J. Pitney, Jr., a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College. “A vigorous California attorney general can have a real impact.”Some critics have accused Mr. Becerra and other California leaders of putting too much energy into fighting Mr. Trump and not enough attention on matters within the state.Joel Anderson, a Republican state senator from San Diego County, suggested Mr. Becerra has retained a partisan mindset from his days as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.“California’s top cop is expected to work for everyone, not just the supermajority,” he said, referring to the Democrats’ domination of the California legislature.Mr. Becerra is not the first attorney general to go hard at a president from a rival party.The Obama administration was a frequent target for Greg Abbott, then the Republican attorney general of Texas and now the state’s governor. According to a tally by The Texas Tribune, Texas sued the administration at least 48 times.If Mr. Becerra’s pace continues, he could well surpass that.He’s got another legal action cooking, he said on Thursday, this time on the environment.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)• “You could call it declaring war, call it whatever you want.” Representative Duncan Hunter, a San Diego area Republican, called for a pre-emptive strike against North Korea.

A poodle named Chappy. And Donald didn’t like him.Nevertheless, this appears to be the closest our current president ever came to having a pet, so attention must be paid.This is possibly the biggest insight in “Raising Trump,” by Donald’s first ex-wife. (We are not going to go into her contention that people who have been married more than 10 years seldom have sex more than “a few times a month.”)I’m sort of presuming that you’re not going to read it, despite the fact that it includes several recipes. So let me summarize. The book is supposed to be about good parenting. But the most important thing you learn is that we can never say another mean thing about Donald Jr. again. Really, it sounds like the worst childhood ever. His story begins with Dad resisting the idea of naming the baby after him, in case his first born turned out to be “a loser.”As a toddler, Don Jr. broke his leg due to a negligent babysitter. Then one day when Ivana was out of town, he and Eric called hysterically to report they had found their nanny unconscious in the basement. (She died.)Wait, there’s more: During their infamous divorce, Dad sent a bodyguard from his office to get Junior, announcing: “You’re not getting him back. I’m going to bring him up myself.”Ivana says she responded: “O.K., keep him. I have two other kids to raise.” Silence and 10 minutes later the bodyguard returned her son.It was, Trump’s ex-wife concluded, “a tactic to upset me.” However for some reason, at around this time Don Jr. stopped speaking to his father and wound up getting shipped to boarding school.After several more years of being the namesake of a man who was then famous for starring in the most sensational tabloid stories of the era, Don Jr. graduated from college, moved to Colorado and got a job bartending. Ivana said she made her disapproval clear by “cutting him off” until he gave up, returned to New York and joined the Trump Organization.Do you see what I mean? It’s a miracle the man is walking and taking nourishment. I will never attack him again. Well, except for the elephant hunting.A lot of “Raising Trump” is Ivana bragging that the children were never spoiled — unlike those Kardashians. There’s a lot about her glamorous wardrobe and triumphs as a C.E.O. in the family businesses. (“My version of helicopter parenting was to bring the kids to work with me in the Trump chopper.”)And you just keep plowing on because you figure sooner or later she’s going to get to The Affair.Finally, it’s 1989 in Aspen. A young woman comes up to Ivana and says: “I’m Marla and I love your husband. Do you?”What followed was perhaps the biggest sex scandal in American history. O.K., I’m totally exaggerating. (Remember that whopper in the 19th century with Grover Cleveland’s illegitimate child?) But the Donald-Marla-Ivana story was unusual in that at the time, nobody involved in it was all that important. Trump was a celebrity real estate developer, but there were plenty of equally rich and glamorous figures in New York, many of them having adultery issues of their own.The difference was that Trump pushed the story, calling his allies in the media with new tidbits or lines of defense. It was as if Grover Cleveland had press agents trying to make sure his side of the love-child scandal was in a headline every day.You will not hear anything about that angle in Ivana’s book. In fact, once the affair comes center stage, you hardly hear anything about Donald at all. He seems to be a sort of passive bystander. (“After the showgirl got pregnant and had a daughter, Donald married her.”)The villain of the book is “Marla freaking Maples” the “showgirl” who broke up her marriage and produced The New York Post’s all-time famous front-page headline: “Best Sex I’ve Ever Had.” If Marla had kidnapped Donald, thrown him in a trunk and driven him off to a shotgun wedding, she could not have been more evil.Ivana’s eagerness to gloss over the sins of an ex who now happens to be president of the most powerful nation on the planet is hardly the worst issue of sexism the country has to discuss this week. But it’s still a useful reminder that Trump has gotten away with absolutely appalling behavior throughout his life, right down to his yelping “locker room talk” whenever people bring up that recording of him bragging about grabbing women’s private parts.Toward the end of the book Trump is “kind enough to waive the $20,000 fee” when Ivana held her third marriage at Mar-a-Lago. The later husbands were pretty terrible, too. One of them had a large, thuggish son who spent one family gathering throttling — oh no! — Donald Jr.The happiest person in the family was probably Chappy.', 'What’s the Matter With Republicans? - The New York TimesThirteen years ago, in the midst of a different Republican administration, the liberal book of the moment was Thomas Frank’s “What’s the Matter With Kansas?” In answering his title’s question, Frank argued that hardworking heartland Americans were being duped by a Republican Party that whipped up culture-war frenzy to disguise its plutocratic aims. Middle-class and working-class Republican voters, he insisted, were voting against their own economic self-interest and getting worse than nothing in return.At the time, Frank’s analysis had two flaws. First, it minimized the importance of social issues, both their inherent moral stakes and their role in shaping the ecology of everyday life, of work and family and community. You don’t have to be a dupe to be a “values voter” of one sort or another: Whether you live in Topeka or Manhattan, you just have to believe that some moral questions are more important than where to set the top tax rate.Second, Frank minimized the extent to which Republicans, in the Bush era and before, did make a concerted effort to deliver for the middle class. The modern G.O.P. was certainly solicitous of the interests of wealthy donors and corporations and always eager for an upper-bracket tax cut. But as Henry Olsen points out in his recent book “The Working Class Republican,” Ronald Reagan also accepted the New Deal settlement and sought to balance his donor base’s interests with his voters’ pocketbook concerns — and George W. Bush did likewise.Yes, the Republican in the White House while Frank was writing his jeremiad was the president of dividend tax cuts and a lower top rate. But Bush was also the president of Medicare Part D, No Child Left Behind, a big homeownership push and a larger child tax credit and lower rates for almost everyone, not just the upper class.So Frank was wrong … or maybe he was prescient. Because he was writing just before Bush won re-election to a second term without a clear middle-class agenda, which led to the unpopular pushes for Social Security reform and an immigration amnesty and to the collapse of Bush’s political position. Then after Obama’s election the G.O.P. lurched away from the middle class in a more stark way than it ever did under Reagan or Bush or the Newt Gingrich speakership, embracing theories about how the working class was actually undertaxed, rallying around tax plans that seemed to threaten middle-class tax increases and promoting an Ayn Randian vision in which heroic entrepreneurs were the only economic actor worth defending.The success of Donald Trump’s populist candidacy seemed like a partial repudiation of this Randian turn, and a possible return to the middle-class-focused politics that had made Reagan and Bush successful — albeit in a more aggressively nationalist and mercantilist form. But as president, Trump has essentially become the Frankian caricature in full, draping the rhetoric of populism over an agenda that so far offers little or nothing to the middle class, making appeals to the religious right that are notable in their cynicism, and rallying his base through culture-war controversies distinguished mostly by their ginned-up phoniness.So “What’s the Matter With Kansas?” was a poor guide to the party of Reagan and George W. Bush, but thus far it is a very useful guide to the Trump administration. And two possible takeaways from this shift seem worth considering.The first is that, for all its failures, not everything about the Bush era was disastrous, and there were ways in which the Bush White House had a clearer sense of what conservatism should offer to the common man than any its would-be successors have come up with since.This doesn’t excuse the disaster of Iraq or the various problems with Bush’s domestic agenda, including the way that one of his middle-class-friendly policies, the push for homeownership, contributed to the housing bubble and the crash. But it is still a mistake for the right to dismiss the Bush agenda as merely “a failure and a fraud,” as my friend Peter Suderman did recently in these pages, and also a mistake for liberals to suggest that Trump is just returning to the Bush playbook, as New York’s Jonathan Chait did in a recent piece.Because he’s not really returning to it; indeed, as things stand in key respects Trump would benefit from imitating Bush. His tax plan offers much less to working Americans than did the Bush tax cuts. His larger agenda is much less thought-through than what Bush attempted in his first term. And if Trump wants to make his populism something more than just a con, he probably has to start with an issue — the child tax credit — that was part of both the Bush agenda and the Contract With America.Appreciating Bush a little more, in this specific way, could offer some reason for optimism about the right. After all his administration was not that long ago, its record suggests that conservatism doesn’t have to be a mix of Randianism and racial resentment, and there’s no necessary reason that Republicans couldn’t learn important lessons from Bush’s failures (don’t try to build democracies in the Middle East, don’t pass an immigration increase your base doesn’t want, etc.) while also returning to his politically effective focus on the middle class.But if you prefer pessimism, you’ll dwell instead on the second takeaway from Thomas Frank’s Trump-era vindication — namely, that a depressing percentage of American conservatives seem perfectly happy with the bargain that Frank claimed defined their party, with a president who ignores their economic interests and public policy more generally and offers instead the perpetual distraction of Twitter feuds and pseudo-patriotic grandstanding.This dispiriting contentment is the sentiment you see from some of Trump’s blue-collar supporters, who love his uncouth rhetorical war on his fellow coastal elites so much that they’re willing to forgive him his threadbare policy agenda or else trust that gridlock and inertia will protect them from Republican bills whose actual contents they might probably oppose.It’s also what you see from a segment of religious conservatives, like those gathered at last week’s Values Voters Summit, who cheered rapturously for an empty, strutting nationalism and a president who makes a mockery of the remoralized culture that they claim to seek.Note that I don’t mean the religious conservatives who supported Trump reluctantly and in a transactional spirit, and who welcome his conservative judicial nominees. I mean those who plainly prefer his brutish braggart’s style to the sort of public decency that Bush or, in a different way, Mitt Romney offered — and who either spin elaborate fantasies about Trump the Christian or laud him as a Conan-esque warlord they think will drive their enemies before them.For these Trump-besotted believers, you get the sense that the Bush administration’s attempts to devise a substantial socially conservative agenda, from bioethics to marriage promotion to faith-based initiatives and more, are remembered not for being timorous, limited or flawed (all of which they were) but for being simply boring. Far better to have a president who really sticks it to those overpaid babies in the N.F.L. and makes the liberals howl with outrage — that’s what a real and fighting conservatism should be all about!What’s the matter with the Republican Party? Many things, but right now above all this: Far too many Trump supporters, far too many conservatives, have seen the then-inaccurate caricature that Frank painted 13 years ago brought to blaring, Technicolor life by Trump — and they’ve decided to become part of the caricature themselves, become exactly what their enemies and critics said they were, become a movement of plutocrats and grievance-mongers with an ever-weaker understanding of the common good.The path out of caricature requires a different moral vision. It requires new ideas and new thinking and new models of leadership. But it also requires looking backward, to Bush and Reagan, to a Republicanism that had a thousand flaws but also understood a few important things Trump’s party has deliberately forgotten.', 'BANGKOK – They couldn\'t award it to Kim Jong Un or Donald Trump; that much was certain.But the granting of the Nobel Peace Prize to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons opened itself to a clear interpretation across Asia: When it comes to the nuclear-saturated war of words on the Korean Peninsula, attention must be paid and treaties must be signed. And it must be done in a preventative way, at top speed, before something happens that can\'t be undone.Looming in the background of the award announcement Friday was the sometimes scalding, sometimes tepid, never silent geopolitical scuffle this year between the young leader of the third-generation Pyongyang regime and the always voluble president of the United States.Even the Nobel committee\'s language keyed in on that. It sounded like a plaintive cry to push parties to the negotiating table — to fix something that\'s already cracked before it\'s completely, irreversibly shattered.The head of the group listed an assortment of the world\'s nuclear nations when she spoke after the win. But it was easy to find significance in the two she mentioned before all others — North Korea and the United States.And this was the immediate assessment from a Nobel historian: "The panel wants to send a signal to North Korea and the U.S. that they need to go into negotiations." The prize, Oeivind Stenersen suggested, was also "coded support" of the Iran nuclear deal.This year\'s Geneva-based winner, known as ICAN, was cited "for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons."From the vantage point of the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding countries, where people shudder weekly at volleys of intemperate words and missile or bomb tests, such a treaty seems a distant dream. And few of the key players seem anywhere near a Nobel Peace Prize.North Korea just conducted its sixth and by far largest nuclear test, moving closer to its goal of mounting a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile.It has repeatedly threatened to obliterate the United States from the map.Such bellicose language from the North is common. It has spent years issuing over-the-top dispatches through its propaganda apparatus promising to destroy the United States.In recent months, however, Pyongyang\'s invective has been matched almost blow by blow for the first time by equally aggressive language from Washington under the Trump administration, or at least Trump himself. The U.S. president has shown no hesitation in cutting through the niceties of diplomatic lingo to excoriate the North and threaten to wipe it out of existence.He has dubbed Kim "Little Rocket Man" and said his regime may not be long for this world.The U.S., of course, has one of the world\'s largest nuclear arsenals, even after significant reductions since the Cold War. It remains the only nation on the planet to use nuclear weapons during a war.In the past four weeks alone, Trump has used words like these, in a recent tweet: "Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won\'t be around much longer!"And Kim, who bestowed upon Trump the rarely used insult "dotard" and pronounced him senile, has used words like these:"Now that Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world and made the most ferocious declaration of a war in history that he would destroy (North Korea), we will consider with seriousness exercising of a corresponding, highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history."Public posturing, sure. But not exactly language that points the way toward common ground, either.The tension in word and deed between Washington and Pyongyang has faded slightly in recent days as the in-the-moment news cycle marches forward, but history shows that to be temporary. Another early-morning missile test, another intemperate remark or worse will put it right back on center stage.The awarding of the $1.1 million prize to ICAN helps that happen, too, though even the group\'s executive director, Beatrice Fihn, said she "worried it was a prank at first" when she got the call from the Nobel committee.Against this backdrop — and in Northeast Asia, a region that remains the only place where nuclear weapons were used against a civilian population during a war — the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in this manner implies one key point.The influential body, which often uses the prize to set the agenda of where the light gets shone, is saying to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, among others: We\'ve got our eye on you, and the world needs to look harder, too.___Ted Anthony, the Bangkok-based director of Asia-Pacific news for The Associated Press, has traveled to North Korea multiple times since 2014.

Although there are worse things in the world than being stuck with Donald Trump as president. You could be locked in a cage with a ravenous tiger. Tied to the leg of a stampeding elephant. Locked in a small room with a swarm of rabid ferrets.Truly, the list goes on. Stop complaining.This week Trump denounced the Republicans’ tax plan before they even had one. He appeared to change his mind once again on immigration and kept the House and Senate dangling on health care. He also told reporters that “I’m a very intelligent person.” The only two things we can absolutely be confident about are that on almost any given day, Trump will refer to himself as intelligent and remind people how many electoral votes he won. For the rest, it’s anybody’s guess.Republicans in Congress generally try to just soldier on, but some of them are starting to snap. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona denounced his party’s president in a dramatic “I’m outta here” speech that Trump shrugged off, saying, “Even before the campaign he came out with this horrible book.” This would presumably be the anti-Trump book Flake published two months ago.Did you know that Jeff Flake once appeared in a reality TV special called “Rival Survival”? I am bringing this up because there does seem to be a reality TV theme running through Washington. Some years are about “hope” and some years we have “fiscal responsibility.” This year it’s along the line of “Naked and Afraid.”“Rival Survival” paired Flake with a Democratic senator, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. The two of them were left alone on a desert island to test their ability to feed and shelter themselves with bipartisan cooperation. They got along great, but were almost completely incapable of catching fish or boiling water. You will have to come up with your own moral.Now Flake is one of the prideful Republican rebels who are standing up to Trump on a daily basis, along with Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and John McCain of Arizona. Corker, whose theme is that Trump is “utterly untruthful” and sort of nuts, does not seem to have ever been in a reality TV show. However, McCain ran for president in 2008 with Sarah Palin as a running mate and that should count for something.Trump, of course, spent much of his career pretending to be himself before the cameras. That’s the thing about reality TV — it’s actually happening, but you’re also making it up. Jeff Flake and his buddy were alone on the desert island with a camera crew. And, according to some reports, the producers decided who to fire on “The Apprentice.”The president tends to be extremely agreeable when he’s playing chief executive at meetings. He had a gathering with Republicans to talk about tax cuts and received a standing ovation. “I called it a love fest,” Trump said later. This is the same guy who got along super-well with some Democratic senators at a dinner not too long ago. They discussed taxes, too, and agreed about everything.But nothing’s necessarily going to last once people leave the room. This week Trump tweeted a denunciation of any Republican tax bill that would modify the popular 401(k) program, vowing, “There will be NO change to your 401(k).” On Wednesday he said it was something his party could use for “negotiating.”This is a man whose strong suit is supposed to be deal making?Early in this presidency, optimists believed that when Trump suddenly veered wildly from one position to another it was because of canny tactics. Now optimists believe that he’s just … really forgetful.It’s tough, as everybody knows, to come to a bipartisan agreement on anything in Washington these days. Way harder than when Jeff Flake was trying to get milk from a coconut with Martin Heinrich. Now, if the two parties are ready to come together, they can’t be sure the president won’t rewrite the script and denounce them for betraying the middle class.I know many of you are exhausted with the continuous wave of crazy-person stories pouring out of the White House. Perhaps you would feel better if you believed that Donald Trump does not so much lie as re-run reality on a different camera. He said this week that he was “extremely nice” to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, one of the four soldiers killed in Niger. Myeshia Johnson said that the president was unfeeling and appeared not to know her husband’s name.Trump claimed he got all the names right because he has “one of the great memories of all time.” It is possible that’s the way he recalls the scene. In the real world, he seems to naturally say things that are off-kilter. And there are possibly days that he calls his oldest daughter “SriLanka.” Or “Mary Sue.”Does that make you feel better? No? Well, I tried.', "                                    Vanessa and Donald Trump Jr. shared photos on social media ahead of Oct. 31 of their kids in all-Ameican costumes.

My maternal grandfather is Water Flowing Together clan and my paternal grandfather is Mexican clan.Traditionally, Navajos introduce themselves by first saying their clans. It lets you know who they are. And I’ve found it’s a great way to get a non-Navajo’s attention. When I was a film programmer at the National Museum of the American Indian, my fail-safe way to quiet down an audience was to get on the mic and say my clans in Navajo. People always fell silent, daunted by the guttural sounds I was spitting out.I’m not a fluent speaker, not even close. My clan introduction makes up about 70 percent of the Navajo words I know. But I was raised to believe that one’s language is everything. Before contact with white folks, indigenous people mostly passed knowledge down orally. Even now, it’s the best way to learn our history, our religion, our songs, our principles; it’s also the best way to get that good gossip.When I was growing up, I’d watch my mom stand in our tiny kitchen, on the phone with her sister Rose, who still lived on our reservation. When they were really dishing, my mom would switch from English to Navajo. I’d strain to decipher even one word, then I’d pounce: “ ‘Beso’! Beso means money! Who’s having money problems? Or did someone win the lottery!? Tell me everything!” (She told me nothing.)My father, a Latino, obviously wasn’t fluent either, but he would strong-arm my brother and me into appreciating our culture. He was like Don King, a tenacious hype man for all things Diné (the Navajo word for “Navajo”). One of his favorite examples of the tribe’s excellence were the Navajo code talkers. During World War II, Navajo men were enlisted by the Marine Corps to develop a code in order to communicate military intelligence for the South Pacific Campaign. (Other tribes also participated, but my dad didn’t hype any of those.)The Japanese were incredibly talented at breaking codes, but the one devised by Navajo Marines, based on their language, was never broken. My dad would always point out that like many Native people, including my mother, many code talkers had been forced to attend government boarding schools where they were punished for speaking their language. But it was that forbidden language that was key to the United States winning the war.In elementary school, I wanted to do a report on them, but when my dad took me to the library to do research we couldn’t find any books that covered their achievements. This was before the internet, and I didn’t have any code talkers in my family, so my search ended there. I remember how angry my dad got, driving us back home empty-handed. Later, when I worked at the museum, I found out that the code talkers’ mission was kept classified until the 1960s. These soldiers returned home from war, with instructions to keep their triumphs a secret. Even when their work was declassified, formal recognition and bad Hollywood biopics didn’t come until decades later.Last week, I watched our president interrupt a White House ceremony honoring the Navajo code talkers to degrade Senator Elizabeth Warren by referring to her as Pocahontas. In front of a painting of the signer of the Indian Removal Act himself, Andrew Jackson. Weeks deep into Native American Heritage month. It was like the worst game of Clue. The president disrespecting my elders, in the cellarium, with the tiki torch. I felt rage. More than usual, which is crazy, because since the election I pretty much use a steady supply of mozzarella sticks to soften my constant fury.Since that ceremony, more than the disbelief — because of course he would do that — one thought keeps coming back to me. It is the root of my frustration: Donald Trump would make a terrible Navajo. Now, I know what you’re thinking, “We don’t know that. Forty-five might make a terrific Navajo.” Well, hear me out.First, Navajos serve in the military. Not me, but a lot of us do. Native Americans enlist in the military at a higher per capita rate than any other racial demographic. Many of the code talkers even doctored their birth certificates so they could join early.Navajos respect women. Precontact, my tribe was matrilineal. Women owned all the property and ran everything. Historically speaking, we were also cool with trans people and immigrants.Navajos actually close deals. You think Donald Trump could sell a $300 hand drum to a nice woman from Minnesota whose husband is trying to drag her away? Because I did that when I was 9.We can handle being hated. Not just by white people which, hoo boy, there’s definitely that, but also by other Natives. We’re one of the largest of the 500-plus federally recognized tribes in the United States. We’re basically Regina George from “Mean Girls.” Get a group of Natives together and I guarantee they will bond by complaining about Navajos. And we don’t care, because people with real power don’t care what others think of them.Navajos are funnier than the president. Like legitimately funny. Because we’re biting, which is a polite way of saying we’re mean. Personally, I love Senator Warren and can’t wait for her to be president, but I or any random Navajo could have come up with better burns for her than Mr. Trump did: “Elizabeth Snorin’ ”; “Human PowerPoint”; “Government Drone.”And this is probably a small thing, but Navajos don’t, say, direct people to meet with Russian ambassadors as a means to potentially undermine our democracy.I just really don’t think he has what it takes, for all of those reasons, but mostly because many Navajos, the code talkers specifically, truly love this country, despite everything it’s done to try to erase us from it. And in three years who knows where the president will be, but I know those proud Marine veterans will still be representing their land and its people. They inspire us to remember that in the recesses of our discouraging past, there are still flashes of grace, dignity and bravery. I hold onto that notion every day. That, and the occasional mozzarella stick.', '', 'Donald Trump Could Really Use a Friend - The New York TimesShow me a person who has no true friendships and I’ll show you someone with little if any talent for generosity, which is a muscle built through interactions with those who have no biological or legal claim to you but lean on you nonetheless.Show me a person who has no true friendships and I’ll show you someone who can’t see the world through another’s eyes.

You need friends.Show me a person who has no true friendships and I’ll show you someone with no adequately moderating influences on his whims, no sufficient cushion for his moods. I’ll show you a full-blown narcissist or full-throttle paranoiac or some combination of both.I’ll show you the president of the United States.On Tuesday, two of his campaign aides, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, published a book about their time with him, “Let Trump Be Trump.” It’s a cunning volume, adulatory on the surface but with just enough grime underneath to promote sales.Racing through it, I had three main thoughts. One, Trump needs fiber. (McDonald’s isn’t so much his guilty pleasure as his daily trough.) Two, Trump needs friends. Three, so much of Trump can be explained through the absence of them. His rages and rampages are fruits of his friendlessness.In the book he doesn’t have people he communes and commiserates with in any raw, real way. He has people he yells at and people he sucks labor and favors from. He has minions, Lewandowski and Bossie among them.They gush about the pleasure savored by Trump’s dinner companions: “He would regale them with stories from his amazing life.” “Friends” are his rapt audience when there’s no other audience around.And they’re replaceable. Trump bluntly told Lewandowski that someone else could easily be put in his job. Soon enough someone was.Lewandowksi and Bossie crow of having observed the man up close, but Trump, cold and monarchic, exists across a moat of his own making.I’ve been struck by this before.In October, The Washington Post published a fascinating profile of Thomas Barrack, a billionaire real estate investor described as “one of President Trump’s oldest friends.” The profile’s author, Michael Kranish, wrote that Barrack often wonders how he has lasted 30 years with such a tempestuous, egomaniacal man.His conclusion? “I’ve never needed anything from him,” Barrack told Kranish. “I was always subservient to him.” That’s obviously how Trump prefers the people around him. On bended knee. In full genuflection.The Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio told me, “He has hangers-on and he has employees and he has other dependents, but I don’t think he has friends.” He’s too twitchily suspicious. Too vain. And so that twitchiness and vanity go unchecked. They metastasize.“He had no friends in his military academy who stuck,” D’Antonio said. “He had no friends in college who stuck. He was a U.S.F.L. owner, and all the other owners wound up hating him.”I ran D’Antonio’s assessment by Mike Tollin, who produced and directed a documentary about the U.S.F.L., a short-lived competitor to the N.F.L. He told me that Trump “showed no interest in, and seemed largely incapable of, genuine friendship.”I asked Tollin what a person unschooled in friendship might also be unpracticed at. “Compassion?” he responded. “Compromise? Those are things you learn from friendship.”Chris Christie was supposedly a friend of Trump’s. I think I can end this paragraph here.The real estate tycoon Richard LeFrak is ostensibly friendly with Trump. He told The Times’s Alan Feuer in early 2016, “If we’re both in Florida, Donald might call and say, ‘Come have dinner at Mar-a-Lago.’ ” But if LeFrak suggested that Trump instead come to his place? “He probably won’t do it.”For Trump, “friendship” isn’t a two-way street. It’s a cul-de-sac. You can spin round and round there, in the shadow of his castle, or you can take your vehicle somewhere else.Is he all that much different with his kids? When Ivanka and the crew sat with CNN’s Anderson Cooper last year to give testimonials about Trump’s presence and parenting back in the day, they repeatedly (and perhaps inadvertently) noted that for quality time with him, they went to his office, his construction sites. They met him on his terms and terrain.Everyone does, and that’s anathema to decency and good governance. He gathers and discards allies at will. He acts to sate his own needs, unworried about the impact on others. For him they don’t fully exist. There’s no space for them, because he has never forced himself to carve it out.“I think of it as an absolute void,” D’Antonio said. It’s no way to live, and it’s no way to lead.', 'SEOUL, South Korea – The Latest on President Donald Trump\'s trip to Asia (all times local):9 p.m.President Donald Trump is hinting at a surprise announcement as he prepares to depart South Korea.Trump says during a toast at a state dinner being held in his honor in Seoul Tuesday that, "we\'re going to have an exciting day tomorrow for many reasons" that "people will find out."Trump is also telling attendees that the partnership between the U.S. and South Korea has never been stronger, as the threat of the North and its nuclear program looms.Trump says: "we\'ve been proud to stand by your side for many decades as an unwavering friend and a loyal ally."

The parents had originally lived in Los Angeles, and when they divorced in 1992, the mother received primary physical custody. But she was an alcoholic, and in 1996, she sent her three children to live with her ex-husband, who’d since moved to Alabama, while she went to rehab. Her lawyer, Wendy Brooks Crew, told me they had an understanding that the kids would stay with their dad for a year, but he refused to return them to their mother because she was living with a woman.There was evidence that the father was abusing the kids, who by 2002 were teenagers. He acknowledged whipping them with a belt and forcing them to sit with paper bags over their heads. He refused to send the younger children to summer school, even though their grades were bad. When the kids called their mother, their father taped the conversations. By the time the case got to the Alabama Supreme Court, a lower court had ruled in the mother’s favor. The Alabama Supreme Court reversed the ruling, with then Chief Justice Roy Moore writing in a concurring opinion that a gay person couldn’t be a fit parent.“Homosexual conduct is, and has been, considered abhorrent, immoral, detestable, a crime against nature, and a violation of the laws of nature and of nature’s God upon which this nation and our laws are predicated,” wrote Moore. He added, “The state carries the power of the sword, that is, the power to prohibit conduct with physical penalties, such as confinement and even execution. It must use that power to prevent the subversion of children toward this lifestyle, to not encourage a criminal lifestyle.”The man who wrote those words is now the Republican candidate for the United States Senate from Alabama. In some ways, this is an embarrassment for Donald Trump, who heeded establishment advice to support Moore’s opponent, sitting Senator Luther Strange, in the primary. But Moore’s victory is also a victory for Trumpism, a populist movement that has eroded normal limits on political behavior.On the surface, Trump and Moore couldn’t be more different. The president is a thrice-married former casino owner who let Howard Stern call his own daughter a “piece of ass.” Moore is a fundamentalist Southern Baptist who writes rhyming verse denouncing wanton sex. “Your children wander aimlessly poisoned by cocaine/Choosing to indulge their lusts, when God has said abstain,” he wrote in his sarcastically titled poem “America the Beautiful.” Trump described himself, during his campaign, as a “real friend” of the L.G.B.T. community, even if he hasn’t behaved like one in office. Moore has said that gay sex should be illegal.But read the rest of “America the Beautiful,” and you start to see where Trump and Moore’s worldviews overlap. Both see a nation in apocalyptic decline, desperate for redemption. Whereas Trump spoke of “American carnage” in his dystopian inauguration speech, Moore calls the country a “moral slum” awaiting God’s judgment. Like the president, Moore is a conspiracy theorist who demonizes religious minorities; he once wrote that Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, should not be allowed to serve in the House of Representatives because he is Muslim.I met Moore over a decade ago, when I was researching my first book, “Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism.” By then, Moore had been forced off the bench for refusing a federal judge’s order to remove a 2.6-ton Ten Commandments monument he’d installed in the state judicial building. This martyrdom made him a cult figure on the religious right. A group of retired military men had taken the monument on tour, holding over 150 viewings and rallies; at an event in Austin, Tex., one of them spoke bitterly to me about the outsized power of American Jews. (Moore would later be re-elected to his seat, only to be suspended for the rest of his term in 2016 for ordering judges not to comply with the Supreme Court decision overturning bans on gay marriage.)In trying to understand the movement I was reporting on, I turned to scholars of authoritarianism and fascism. If their words seemed relevant then, they’re even more so now. Fritz Stern, a historian who fled Nazi Germany, described the “conservative revolution” that prefigured National Socialism: “The movement did embody a paradox: its followers sought to destroy the despised present in order to recapture an idealized past in an imaginary future.”His formulation helps explain the overlapping appeal of Trump and Moore, who thrill their supporters with their distinctly un-conservative eagerness to destroy legal and political norms. What Moore’s critics see as lawlessness, his fans see as insurgent valor. Trump’s most prominent nationalist supporters, including Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka, lined up behind Moore, describing him as part of the Trumpian revolution. Nigel Farage, a right-wing British politician and Trump ally, flew to Fairhope, Ala., to speak at a rally for Moore, saying on stage, “It is getting someone like him elected that will rejuvenate the movement that led to Trump and Brexit.”Whether or not that’s true, the movement that led to Trump has brought us to a place where Moore will probably soon sit in the United States Senate, something I could hardly have imagined when I first encountered him. Back then, anti-gay prejudice was far more acceptable than it is today, but Moore’s messianic denunciation of a lesbian mother was still shocking. Trump is not a pious man, but by destroying informal restraints on reactionary rhetoric, he’s made his party hospitable to the cruelest of theocrats. Moore’s success is bound to encourage more candidates like him. The Republican establishment’s borders have been breached. Its leaders should have built a wall.', "Greg Palkot reports on the alleged evacuation drills in the region.The United States is reportedly quietly pursuing diplomatic avenues with North Korea despite repeated pushback from President Donald Trump.Joseph Yun, a U.S. negotiator with North Korea, has been in contact with officials from Pyongyang’s United Nations mission, a senior State Department official told Reuters on Tuesday.Yun has stressed to his North Korean counterparts that the regime needs to “stop testing” nuclear bombs and missiles, the official said. North Korea has conducted its sixth nuclear detonation and has fired missiles that could potentially carry a nuclear warhead this year.The regime may launch a missile while Trump is in Asia this week, according to Newsweek.When Trump entered the White House, Yun’s objective was to seek the release of U.S. prisoners. The State Department official said now his job is much broader than before.Though Yun is trying to make progress in his talks with North Korean officials, Reuters reported he has not had high-level talks with anyone from the regime since June when the U.S. secured the release of Otto Warmbier.Warmbier returned to the U.S. in a coma and died days later. His death iced relations between the U.S. and North Korean contacts, the official said.Reports of behind-the-scenes diplomacy come despite Trump’s assertions that talks with North Korea are a waste of time. Trump has previously vowed to “totally destroy” North Korea, if it threatened the U.S. or its allies abroad.Trump is expected to visit Asia beginning Friday. He will be visiting Camp Humphreys, a military base about 40 miles south of Seoul, to highlight the U.S.-South Korean partnership and burden-sharing. He will not visit the Demilitarized Zone, an official told reporters Tuesday.Trump'strip will take him to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. The president will attend several summits, hold a series of bilateral meetings, be feted at banquets and play golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.The Associated Press contributed to this report.", '', 'Brad Blakeman, former Deputy assistant to President George W. Bush, on President Trump ending subsidies to insurance companies under ObamaCare.President Trump plans to halt payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act "immediately," in a major blow to ObamaCare that is likely to draw a legal challenge.The president, though, used the overnight decision to up pressure on Democrats to negotiate a "fix" to the "imploding" health care law."The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!" he said in a pre-dawn tweet on Friday.The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!He added, "ObamaCare is a broken mess. Piece by piece we will now begin the process of giving America the great HealthCare it deserves!"The Justice Department took swift action, notifying a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., in connection with a related lawsuit that an upcoming Oct. 18 payment “will not occur.”The decision is the latest effort in the president’s bid to ultimately “repeal and replace” what’s considered the signature legislation of his White House predecessor.The White House said in a statement that the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is no appropriation for so-called cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers under the ObamaCare law."We will discontinue these payments immediately," said acting HHS Secretary Eric Hargan and Medicare administrator Seema Verma.Trump\'s decision was expected to rattle already-unsteady insurance marketplaces. The president has previously threatened to end the payments, which help reduce health insurance copays and deductibles for people with modest incomes, but remain under a legal cloud.Trump has privately told at least one lawmaker that the payments may continue if a bipartisan deal is reached on heath care, The Wall Street Journal reported.Pushback expectedThe president\'s action will likely to trigger a lawsuit from state attorneys general, who contend the subsidies to insurers are fully authorized by federal law, and the president\'s position is reckless.Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, called the decision “sabotage,” and promised a lawsuit.After the president’s intentions were disclosed, leading Democrats in Congress were quick to criticize the plan.In a statement, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., predicted that Trump’s expected action would increase Americans’ health premiums by 20 percent or more."If these reports are true,” the Democrats said in the joint statement, referring to the president’s plans, “the president is walking away from the good-faith, bipartisan Alexander-Murray negotiations and risking the health care of millions of Americans.”The Democrats were referring to bipartisan talks being led by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., to seek a bipartisan agreement for funding ObamaCare subsidies and stabilizing health insurance markets.Order to lower premiumsEarlier Thursday, Trump predicted that “millions and millions of people” would benefit from an executive order he signed Thursday to make lower-premium health insurance plans more widely available.But the changes Trump hopes to bring about could take months or even longer. That\'s according to administration officials who outlined the order for reporters. The proposals may not be finalized in time to affect coverage for 2019, let alone next year.White House domestic policy director Andrew Bremberg said that Trump still believes Congress needs to repeal and replace the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. The White House described the order as first steps.Trump signed the order in the White House\'s Roosevelt Room surrounded by Vice President Mike Pence, members of his Cabinet and Congress.Trump employed the executive order because the Republican-controlled Congress has been unable to pass a plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare.Trump says the health care system "will get better" with his action, and the action will cost the federal government nothing.The president says he still wants Congress repeal and replace the Obama health care law. But he says his order will give people more competition, more choices and lower premiums.The Associated Press contributed to this story.', 'The Abbie Hoffman of the Right: Donald Trump - The New York TimesIt has to be admitted that Donald Trump is doing exactly what he was elected to do.He was not elected to be a legislative president. He never showed any real interest in policy during the campaign. He was elected to be a cultural president. He was elected to shred the dominant American culture and to give voice to those who felt voiceless in that culture. He’s doing that every day.What’s troubling to me is that those who are the targets of his assaults seem to have no clue about what is going on. When they feel the most righteous, like this past weekend, they are actually losing and in the most peril.Let me try to explain what I think is happening:After World War II the Protestant establishment dominated the high ground of American culture and politics. That establishment eventually failed. It tolerated segregation and sexism, led the nation into war in Vietnam and became stultifying.So in the late 1960s along came a group of provocateurs like Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and the rest of the counterculture to upend the Protestant establishment. People like Hoffman were buffoons, but also masters of political theater.They never attracted majority support for their antics, but they didn’t have to. All they had to do was provoke, offend the crew-cut crowd, generate outrage and set off a cycle that ripped apart the cultural consensus.The late 1960s were a time of intense cultural conflict, which left a lot of wreckage in its wake. But eventually a new establishment came into being, which we will call the meritocratic establishment.These were the tame heirs to Hoffman and Rubin. They were well educated. They cut their moral teeth on the civil rights and feminist movements. They embraced economic, social and moral individualism. They came to dominate the institutions of American society on both left and right.Hillary Clinton is part of this more educated cohort. So are parts of the conservative establishment. If you’re reading this newspaper, you probably are, too, as am I.This establishment, too, has had its failures. It created an economy that benefits itself and leaves everybody else out. It led America into war in Iraq and sent the working class off to fight it. It has developed its own brand of cultural snobbery. Its media, film and music industries make members of the working class feel invisible and disrespected.So in 2016, members of the outraged working class elected their own Abbie Hoffman as president. Trump is not good at much, but he is wickedly good at sticking his thumb in the eye of the educated elites. He doesn’t have to build a new culture, or even attract a majority. He just has to tear down the old one.That’s exactly what he’s doing. Donald Trump came into a segmenting culture and he is further tearing apart every fissure. He has a nose for every wound in the body politic and day after day he sticks a red-hot poker in one wound or another and rips it open.Day by day Trump is turning us into a nation of different planets. Each planet feels more righteous about itself and is more isolated from and offended by the other planets.The members of the educated class saw this past weekend’s N.F.L. fracas as a fight over racism. They felt mobilized and unified in that fight and full of righteous energy. Members of the working class saw the fracas as a fight about American identity. They saw Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin try to dissuade Alejandro Villanueva, a three-time combat veteran, from celebrating the flag he risked his life for. Members of this class also felt mobilized, unified and full of righteous energy.I don’t know which planet is bigger, or which would win an election, but that frankly doesn’t matter. All that matters is that Trump is shredding the culture and ending the dominance of the meritocratic establishment.He continually goes after racial matters in part because he’s a bigot but also in part because multiculturalism is the theology of the educated class and it’s the leverage point he can most effectively use to isolate the educated class from everyone else.He is so destructive because his enemies help him. He ramps up the aggression. His enemies ramp it up more, to preserve their own dignity. But the ensuing cultural violence only serves Trump’s long-term destructive purpose. America is seeing nearly as much cultural conflict as it did in the late 1960s. It’s quite possible that after four years of this Trump will have effectively destroyed the prevailing culture. The reign of the meritocratic establishment will be just as over as the reign of the Protestant establishment now is.Of course Donald Trump is a buffoon. Buffoonery is his most effective weapon. Because of him, a new culture will have to be built, new values promulgated and a new social fabric will have to be woven, one that brings the different planets back into relation with one another.That’s the work of the next 20 years.', 'SEOUL, South Korea – President Donald Trump visits South Korea on Tuesday on the second leg of his first official Asian tour. While Trump will be looking to use his trip to strengthen Washington\'s alliance with Seoul and reaffirm their joint push to maximize pressure on North Korea over its nuclear program, he will also be faced with several thorny issues weighing on the relationship. Here\'s a look at some of them.__NORTH KOREABoth Trump and South Korea\'s liberal President Moon Jae-in agree that it\'s time to ramp up sanctions and pressure on North Korea, which has ignored international condemnation as it moves forward with its nuclear and missile tests.But Moon, a former human rights lawyer, still favors dialogue as a way to defuse the nuclear tension and vehemently opposes a potential military clash, which experts believe would cause enormous casualties in South Korea. This contrasts with Trump, who has threatened the North with "fire and fury" and exchanged warlike rhetoric with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.The world will be watching what kind of language Trump will use in his comments on North Korea. A hint at a military option or crude insults directed at Kim — like the term "Little Rocket Man" he previously used to deride the young North Korean dictator — is certain to enrage North Korea, which could react with weapons tests and threats of war.Increasing animosity would be a burden for Moon.__TRADERenegotiating South Korea\'s bilateral free trade agreement with the U.S., dubbed KORUS, is likely be high on the agenda during the Trump-Moon summit. Trump has criticized the deal as a source of the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea, an argument officials there dismiss.Before Trump\'s presidency, many in South Korea and the United States regarded the deal as a key pillar of their alliance. But Trump has made scrapping trade deals a hallmark of his presidency. Earlier this year, reports that Trump was considering triggering a withdrawal from the deal caused uproar not just in South Korea but also in the United States.The two countries eventually started talks this summer on renegotiating the deal, which went into effect five years ago. Many South Koreans are watching if Trump will make off-the-cuff remarks on the trade deal during news conferences or on Twitter.__U.S. TROOPSTrump wants South Korea to pay more for the U.S. military presence on its soil, which is chiefly aimed at deterring potential aggression from North Korea.During election campaigning, Trump said South Korea and Japan must make more contributions for together hosting 80,000 U.S. troops or he might withdraw those soldiers. Security jitters subsequently flared among many in South Korea and Japan.Since taking office in January, Trump hasn\'t publicly threatened to pull out the troops but he did request greater burden-sharing with South Korea during his first summit talks with Moon in July.South Korea currently pays more than 900 billion won ($800 million) annually and negotiations with the United States are to start in the coming months to try to determine a new amount for South Korea to contribute.__U.S. MISSILE DEFENSESouth Korea\'s recent agreement with China to try to end disputes over an advanced U.S. missile defense system deployed in South Korea could be an issue.While announcing the deal last week, Beijing, which views the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system as a security threat, said it noted that Seoul stated it won\'t do several things: deploying an additional THAAD battery, helping develop security cooperation with Japan and the U.S. into a trilateral military alliance and joining a global U.S. missile defense network. South Korea\'s foreign minister made similar remarks during a parliament committee meeting earlier last week.Critics say the South Korean moves, dubbed by local media as its "Three No" policies, could undermine the operational capability of the allied South Korea-U.S. forces and Trump\'s push to bolter three-way cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo to put more pressure on Pyongyang.Other issues at stake are South Korea\'s hope to regain the wartime operational control of its troops, currently placed at the hands of the chief of the 28,000 U.S. troops in the South, and Seoul\'s possible purchase of high-tech U.S. weapons systems.__Associated Press writer Youkyung Lee contributed to this report.', 'Can My Children Be Friends With White People? - The New York TimesMy oldest son, wrestling with a 4-year-old’s happy struggles, is trying to clarify how many people can be his best friend. “My best friends are you and Mama and my brother and …” But even a child’s joy is not immune to this ominous political period. This summer’s images of violence in Charlottesville, Va., prompted an array of questions. “Some people hate others because they are different,” I offer, lamely. A childish but distinct panic enters his voice. “But I’m not different.”It is impossible to convey the mixture of heartbreak and fear I feel for him. Donald Trump’s election has made it clear that I will teach my boys the lesson generations old, one that I for the most part nearly escaped. I will teach them to be cautious, I will teach them suspicion, and I will teach them distrust. Much sooner than I thought I would, I will have to discuss with my boys whether they can truly be friends with white people.Meaningful friendship is not just a feeling. It is not simply being able to share a beer. Real friendship is impossible without the ability to trust others, without knowing that your well-being is important to them. The desire to create, maintain or wield power over others destroys the possibility of friendship. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous dream of black and white children holding hands was a dream precisely because he realized that in Alabama, conditions of dominance made real friendship between white and black people impossible.History has provided little reason for people of color to trust white people in this way, and these recent months have put in the starkest relief the contempt with which the country measures the value of racial minorities. America is transfixed on the opioid epidemic among white Americans (who often get hooked after being overprescribed painkillers — while studies show that doctors underprescribe pain medication for African-Americans). But when black lives were struck by addiction, we cordoned off minority communities with the police and threw away an entire generation of black and Hispanic men.Likewise, despite centuries of exclusion and robust evidence of continuing racism, minority underemployment is often couched in the language of bad choices and personal responsibility. When systemic joblessness strikes swaths of white America, we get an entire presidential campaign centered on globalization’s impact on the white working class. Even the nerve of some rich or visible African-Americans to protest that America, in its laws and in its police, has rarely been just to all has been met with the howls of a president who cannot tolerate that the lucky and the uppity do not stay in their place.As against our gauzy national hopes, I will teach my boys to have profound doubts that friendship with white people is possible. When they ask, I will teach my sons that their beautiful hue is a fault line. Spare me platitudes of how we are all the same on the inside. I first have to keep my boys safe, and so I will teach them before the world shows them this particular brand of rending, violent, often fatal betrayal.Let me assure you that my heartbreak dwarfs my anger. I grew up in a classic Midwestern college town. With all its American faults, it was a diverse and happy-childhood kind of place, slightly dull in the way that parents wish for their children. If race showed in class lines, school cliques and being pulled over more often, our little Americana lacked the deep racial tension and mistrust that seem so hard to escape now.What’s surprising is that I am heartbroken at all. It is only for African-Americans who grew up in such a place that watching Mr. Trump is so disorienting. For many weary minorities, the ridiculous thing was thinking friendship was possible in the first place. It hurts only if you believed friendship could bridge the racial gorge.Of course, the rise of this president has broken bonds on all sides. But for people of color the stakes are different. Imagining we can now be friends across this political line is asking us to ignore our safety and that of our children, to abandon personal regard and self-worth. Only white people can cordon off Mr. Trump’s political meaning, ignore the “unpleasantness” from a position of safety. His election and the year that has followed have fixed the awful thought in my mind too familiar to black Americans: “You can’t trust these people.”It is not Mr. Trump himself who has done this. Were it not for our reverence for money, Mr. Trump would be easily recognized as the simple-minded, vulgar, bigoted blowhard he is. It is certainly not the neo-Nazis marching on Charlottesville; we have seen their type before. Rather, what has truly broken my heart are the ranks of Mr. Trump’s many allies and apologists.Mr. Trump’s supporters are practiced at purposeful blindness. That his political life started with denying, without evidence, that Barack Obama is American — that this black man could truly be the legitimate president — is simply ignored. So, too, is his history of housing discrimination, his casual conflation of Muslims with terrorists, his reducing Mexican-Americans to murderers and rapists. All along, his allies have watched racial pornography, describing black America as pathological. Yet they deny that there is any malice whatsoever in his words and actions. And they dismiss any attempt to recognize the danger of his wide-ranging animus as political correctness.But the deepest rift is with the apologists, the “good” Trump voters, the white people who understand that Mr. Trump says “unfortunate” things but support him because they like what he says on jobs and taxes. They bristle at the accusation that they supported racism, insisting they had to ignore Mr. Trump’s ugliness. Relying on everyday decency as a shield, they are befuddled at the chill that now separates them from black people in their offices and social circles. They protest: Have they ever said anything racist? Don’t they shovel the sidewalk of the new black neighbors? Surely, they say, politics — a single vote — does not mean we can’t be friends.I do not write this with liberal condescension or glee. My heart is unbearably heavy when I assure you we cannot be friends.The same is true, unfortunately, of those who hold no quarter for Mr. Trump but insist that black people need to do the reaching out, the moderating, the accommodating. Imagine the white friend during the civil rights era who disliked blacks’ being beaten to death but wished the whole thing would just settle down. However likable, you could not properly describe her as a friend. Sometimes politics makes demands on the soul.Don’t misunderstand: White Trump supporters and people of color can like one another. But real friendship? Mr. Trump’s bruised ego invents outrageous claims of voter fraud, not caring that this rhetoric was built upon dogs and water hoses set on black children and even today the relentless effort to silence black voices. His macho talk about “law and order” does not keep communities safe and threatens the very bodies of the little boys I love. No amount of shoveled snow makes it all right, and too many imagine they can have it both ways. It is this desperation to reap the rewards of white power without being so much as indicted that James Baldwin recognized as America’s criminal innocence.For African-Americans, race has become a proxy not just for politics but also for decency. White faces are swept together, ominous anxiety behind every chance encounter at the airport or smiling white cashier. If they are not clearly allies, they will seem unsafe to me.Barack Obama’s farewell address encouraged us to reach across partisan lines. But there is a difference between disagreeing over taxes and negotiating one’s place in America, the bodies of your children, your humanity. Our racial wound has undone love and families, and ignoring the depths of the gash will not cause it to heal.We can still all pretend we are friends. If meaningful civic friendship is impossible, we can make do with mere civility — sharing drinks and watching the game. Indeed, even in Donald Trump’s America, I have not given up on being friends with all white people. My bi-ethnic wife, my most trusted friend, understands she is seen as a white woman, even though her brother and father are not. Among my dearest friends, the wedding party and children’s godparents variety, many are white. But these are the friends who have marched in protest, rushed to airports to protest the president’s travel ban, people who have shared the risks required by strength and decency.There is hope, though. Implicitly, without meaning to, Mr. Trump asks us if this is the best we can do. It falls to us to do better. We cannot agree on our politics, but we can declare that we stand beside one another against cheap attack and devaluation; that we live together and not simply beside one another. In the coming years, when my boys ask again their questions about who can be their best friend, I pray for a more hopeful answer.', 'Brad Blakeman, former Deputy assistant to President George W. Bush, on President Trump ending subsidies to insurance companies under ObamaCare.President Trump plans to halt payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act "immediately," in a major blow to ObamaCare that is likely to draw a legal challenge.The president, though, used the overnight decision to up pressure on Democrats to negotiate a "fix" to the "imploding" health care law."The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!" he said in a pre-dawn tweet on Friday.The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!He added, "ObamaCare is a broken mess. Piece by piece we will now begin the process of giving America the great HealthCare it deserves!"The Justice Department took swift action, notifying a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., in connection with a related lawsuit that an upcoming Oct. 18 payment “will not occur.”The decision is the latest effort in the president’s bid to ultimately “repeal and replace” what’s considered the signature legislation of his White House predecessor.The White House said in a statement that the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is no appropriation for so-called cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers under the ObamaCare law."We will discontinue these payments immediately," said acting HHS Secretary Eric Hargan and Medicare administrator Seema Verma.Trump\'s decision was expected to rattle already-unsteady insurance marketplaces. The president has previously threatened to end the payments, which help reduce health insurance copays and deductibles for people with modest incomes, but remain under a legal cloud.Trump has privately told at least one lawmaker that the payments may continue if a bipartisan deal is reached on heath care, The Wall Street Journal reported.Pushback expectedThe president\'s action will likely to trigger a lawsuit from state attorneys general, who contend the subsidies to insurers are fully authorized by federal law, and the president\'s position is reckless.Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, called the decision “sabotage,” and promised a lawsuit.After the president’s intentions were disclosed, leading Democrats in Congress were quick to criticize the plan.In a statement, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., predicted that Trump’s expected action would increase Americans’ health premiums by 20 percent or more."If these reports are true,” the Democrats said in the joint statement, referring to the president’s plans, “the president is walking away from the good-faith, bipartisan Alexander-Murray negotiations and risking the health care of millions of Americans.”The Democrats were referring to bipartisan talks being led by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., to seek a bipartisan agreement for funding ObamaCare subsidies and stabilizing health insurance markets.Order to lower premiumsEarlier Thursday, Trump predicted that “millions and millions of people” would benefit from an executive order he signed Thursday to make lower-premium health insurance plans more widely available.But the changes Trump hopes to bring about could take months or even longer. That\'s according to administration officials who outlined the order for reporters. The proposals may not be finalized in time to affect coverage for 2019, let alone next year.White House domestic policy director Andrew Bremberg said that Trump still believes Congress needs to repeal and replace the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. The White House described the order as first steps.Trump signed the order in the White House\'s Roosevelt Room surrounded by Vice President Mike Pence, members of his Cabinet and Congress.Trump employed the executive order because the Republican-controlled Congress has been unable to pass a plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare.Trump says the health care system "will get better" with his action, and the action will cost the federal government nothing.The president says he still wants Congress repeal and replace the Obama health care law. But he says his order will give people more competition, more choices and lower premiums.The Associated Press contributed to this story.', 'BEIJING – President Donald Trump made a cooperative partner for Beijing\'s sweeping efforts to control the message of his heavily choreographed visit.Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, took no questions at an event Thursday billed as a news briefing, a reduction of already minimal press interaction during previous visits by American leaders.During a 2014 visit by then-President Barack Obama, Xi took a symbolic single question from a reporter for a Chinese state newspaper. He ignored an American reporter\'s question about whether Beijing might ease restrictions on visas for foreign journalists.Trump, who has called the press the "enemy of the American people," also took no questions during an event Thursday at which Chinese companies signed contracts to buy American jetliners, soybeans and other goods.The visit comes at a time when Trump faces uncomfortable questions at home about Russia and possible gun controls following deadly mass shootings.Xi almost never takes questions from reporters.Meanwhile, as Chinese television showed Trump and Xi visiting the imperial palace in Beijing, censors scrubbed comments about Trump\'s visit from China\'s lively internet forums.Reports by propaganda outlets including the ruling Communist Party\'s main newspaper, People\'s Daily, dominated posts on the popular Twitter-like microblog service, Sina Weibo.The comments function on most posts, which can attract witty remarks from Chinese internet users, appeared to have been disabled or limited. Only a few dozen "carefully chosen" comments with positive messages were allowed.According to Free Weibo, a site that tracks online censorship, posts that were deleted include humorous comments about the remarkable lack of traffic congestion in Beijing as Trump\'s motorcade passed Tiananmen Square.Others asked whether Trump is able to get on Twitter, which China\'s internet filters block the public from seeing.

Records Suggest Otherwise. - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — Standing before reporters in February, President Trump said unequivocally that he knew of nobody from his campaign who was in contact with Russians during the election. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has told the Senate the same thing.Court documents unsealed this week cast doubt on both statements and raised the possibility that Mr. Sessions could be called back to Congress for further questioning.The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, unsealed his first charges Monday in a wide-ranging investigation into Russian attempts to disrupt the presidential election and whether anyone close to Mr. Trump was involved. Records in that case show that George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser, had frequent discussions with Russians in 2016 and trumpeted his connections in front of Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions.For months, journalists have revealed evidence that associates of Mr. Trump met with Russians during the campaign and the presidential transition. But the court documents represent the first concrete evidence that Mr. Trump was personally told about ties between a campaign adviser and Russian officials.At a March 31, 2016, meeting between Mr. Trump and his foreign policy team, Mr. Papadopoulos introduced himself and said “that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin,” according to court records.“He went into the pitch right away,” said J. D. Gordon, a campaign adviser who attended the meeting. “He said he had a friend in London, the Russian ambassador, who could help set up a meeting with Putin.”Mr. Trump listened with interest. Mr. Sessions vehemently opposed the idea, Mr. Gordon recalled. “And he said that no one should talk about it,” because Mr. Sessions thought it was a bad idea that he did not want associated with the campaign, he said.Several of Mr. Trump’s campaign advisers attended the March 2016 meeting, and at least two of those advisers are now in the White House: Hope Hicks, the communications director, and Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser.After Mr. Trump was sworn in, he could not escape questions about Russia. At a Feb. 16, 2017, White House news conference, a reporter asked Mr. Trump, “Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?”“No,” Mr. Trump said. “Nobody that I know of. Nobody.”The White House has sought to portray Mr. Papadopoulos as an insignificant figure in the campaign.Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer dealing with matters related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation, said the White House stood behind the president’s comments.“The media’s willingness to inflate Papadopoulos, a young unpaid volunteer and supposed energy expert, into an important thought leader in the campaign or Russian operative is ludicrous,” Mr. Cobb said. “The evidence so far suggests he attended one meeting, said something about Russia and was immediately shut down by everyone in the room. It’s very important to remember that he is not a criminal now because of anything he did for the campaign — he is a criminal because he initially lied to the F.B.I.”A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.Another member of the foreign policy team, Carter Page, said on Thursday that he told Mr. Sessions in passing in June 2016 that he planned to travel to Russia for a trip “completely unrelated” to his volunteer role in the campaign. “Understandably, it was as irrelevant then as it is now,” Mr. Page said. Mr. Page traveled twice to Russia in 2016.Democrats in the Senate said on Thursday that they would push to have Mr. Sessions return to the Judiciary Committee for further questioning.“He now needs to come back before the committee, in person, under oath, to explain why he cannot seem to provide truthful, complete answers to these important and relevant questions,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who is on the Judiciary Committee.Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, another Democrat on the committee, pointed out that Mr. Sessions’s testimony was under oath and “wasn’t just some random comment he made in passing on the street.”Mr. Sessions faced similar questions in January before the Senate Judiciary Committee, when Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, asked him about contacts between the campaign and Russia. “I’m not aware of any of those activities,” Mr. Sessions said. He denied having any such contacts himself.Democrats condemned those remarks as misleading when it was revealed that Mr. Sessions held meetings with the Russian ambassador during the campaign. Last month, Mr. Franken renewed his questioning.“You don’t believe that surrogates from the Trump campaign had communications with the Russians?” he asked.“I did not, and I’m not aware of anyone else that did,” Mr. Sessions replied. “And I don’t believe it happened.”He did not make any reference to Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Sessions has said he answered honestly because he was being questioned in the context of Russian officials continuously exchanging information with campaign advisers.Mr. Gordon said that while the March 2016 meeting technically contradicted Mr. Sessions’s testimony, he defended the attorney general.“This is something he heard way back in March from some young man who was not authorized to speak for the campaign,” he said. “I don’t blame Senator Sessions for not remembering that.” He said that only in the political “gotcha game” could the matter be considered significant.The court documents in the Papadopoulos case represent the most explicit evidence yet that Mr. Trump’s campaign was eager to coordinate with Russian officials to undermine his rival, Hillary Clinton. Federal investigators suspected that Russian intelligence services used intermediaries to contact Mr. Papadopoulos to gain influence with the campaign, offering “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying about those contacts and is cooperating with the F.B.I.On Thursday, as news of Mr. Papadopoulos’s Russian ties continued to ripple through Washington, Mr. Franken sent a stern letter to Mr. Sessions. “This is another example in an alarming pattern in which you, the nation’s top law enforcement official, apparently failed to tell the truth, under oath,” he wrote.The case against Mr. Papadopoulos was unsealed at the same time as an unrelated indictment against two other former campaign advisers, Paul J. Manafort and Rick Gates. Taken together, the three charges sent a foreboding message to a fourth adviser to Mr. Trump’s campaign, Michael T. Flynn.White House officials and others in the case are bracing for charges against Mr. Flynn, a retired three-star general who had a short and tumultuous tenure as national security adviser. Mr. Mueller is investigating Mr. Flynn for not disclosing his Russian contacts or his foreign lobbying work.Mr. Manafort was indicted on seldom-used charges of concealing foreign lobbying, as well as for lying on federal documents — the same activities for which Mr. Flynn is being investigated.“It’s a bad sign,” said Paul Krieger, who until recently was the top federal fraud prosecutor in Manhattan. “It shows that the special counsel’s office will not hesitate to charge individuals connected to the administration or campaign with obstruction-like offenses.”Mr. Flynn, one of the architects of Mr. Trump’s “America first” foreign policy, did not disclose payments from Russia-linked entities on financial disclosure documents. He did not mention a paid speech he gave in Moscow, and he belatedly disclosed, after leaving the White House, that the Turkish government had paid him more than $500,000 for lobbying services.Charging people for not disclosing their foreign lobbying is extremely rare, a point that Mr. Manafort’s lawyers made in documents filed in court on Thursday. Since 1966, his lawyers wrote, only six such cases have been filed and only one person has been convicted. Such violations are typically handled administratively.“It is far from clear what activity triggers a requirement to file a report as a foreign agent,” said Kevin M. Downing, Mr. Manafort’s lawyer.Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates appeared in court briefly on Thursday. Lawyers discussed the conditions of their house arrest and the possibility of a trial in April.White House officials have long been anticipating the indictments of Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn, and have tried to distance themselves from both men. They were caught by surprise, however, by Mr. Papadopoulos’s guilty plea and the fact that he had been cooperating with the F.B.I. since July.That cooperation agreement fueled speculation that Mr. Papadopoulos had secretly recorded his conversations with White House officials this summer. But Mr. Cobb said he had seen no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos had visited the White House or had recent conversations with staff members.“We have no indication that this George Papadopoulos came to this White House,” Mr. Cobb said, adding that a different person with the same name had entered the White House this year.Court documents do not explain the extent of Mr. Papadopoulos’s cooperation with Mr. Mueller’s investigation, but prosecutors said they showed him emails, chat transcripts, text messages and other records “in an attempt to refresh his recollection” about his contacts with Russians and with members of the Trump campaign.', '', 'Commercial Real Estate, Which Fueled Trump’s Fortune, Fares Well in Tax Plan - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — An industry familiar to President Trump appears to have emerged from the Republican tax rewrite relatively unscathed: commercial real estate.For months, commercial real estate developers had been concerned that the tax plan in the works would make it more difficult or expensive for them to take out huge bank loans or would damage demand in the property market.But if the  plan unveiled this week by House Republicans comes to pass, developers like Mr. Trump, who made much of his fortune building skyscrapers, hotels and resorts, will have little to worry about.“The industry was left whole,” said Thomas J. Bisacquino, president of NAIOP, a commercial real estate development trade group. “The provisions we feel are working will still work.”Developers were fearful that the special tax treatment of “carried interest” — fees that are taxed as capital gains, not income — would be amended, or that they would no longer be able to deduct interest expenses from their taxable profits. They were also concerned that certain exchanges of commercial property, which currently enjoy a tax deferral, would face immediate taxation.But the bill included no such changes to the industry, and developers are thankful.“I think Trump, having lived through a couple of real estate cycles, probably is in tune with this more than the average policy maker,” said Martin Schuh, the head of government relations at the CRE Finance Council, a commercial real estate advocacy group. “Him being an active industry participant gives him an insight that most folks don’t have.”Mr. Trump is no stranger to how taxes can affect his industry. In 1991, he appeared before the House Budget Committee and laced into the tax overhaul ushered in by President Ronald Reagan five years earlier. Mr. Trump, a property developer at the time, said the legislation, which Republicans and the president himself now herald, was responsible for sinking commercial real estate prices and ushering in an economic downturn.“This tax act was just an absolute catastrophe for the country, for the real estate industry, and I really hope that something can be done,” Mr. Trump said then.This time Mr. Trump, who has the final signoff on any legislation, and his business empire have little to fear.Companies can now deduct their interest expenses on commercial loans, but under the House bill, certain industries would face a cap on the amount of interest that could be deducted each year.But that cap would not apply to commercial real estate.So-called like-kind transactions allow businesses to defer taxes on deal making if they do not pocket the cash. For instance, if a developer decides to sell a midsize office building to reinvest in a larger one, the proceeds would not be taxed immediately.While the plan does end the tax deferral for personal property exchanges, commercial real estate developers would keep the benefit.Carried interest is another big item that property developers were watching closely. Mr. Trump said many times on the campaign trail that he would close the “loophole” that allows hedge fund and private equity managers to have their compensation treated as capital gains and taxed at a rate of 23.8 percent, rather than as income, which is taxed as high as 39.6 percent. Partners at real estate firms receive similar treatment for returns on some of their investments.Surprisingly, the House plan does not address carried interest and the issue is largely moot because the new tax rate for pass-through businesses — which account for most real estate investment partnerships — would fall to 25 percent.Commercial real estate lobbyists remain cautious, since the bill could change as it moves through the House and Senate.The sector’s residential real estate brethren are already feeling the pain of a tax plan that they say could rock the housing market by curbing the appeal of and limiting the mortgage interest deduction.Like the housing industry, commercial property was also hit hard during the financial crisis as companies laid off workers and needed less office space. While the market has largely rebounded, the Federal Reserve warned this year that property valuations were of “growing concern” and that appetites for commercial real estate lending could start to tighten.That Mr. Trump’s industry has not been targeted with new taxes could provide fodder for critics of the Republican tax plan who have argued that the president is promoting policies that will enrich him and his family. Democrats have said that Mr. Trump must release his tax returns to provide transparency over potential conflicts of interest that he might have.“At the very same time that Trump’s plan undercuts the home mortgage tax credit — and a host of others that middle-class Americans rely on — in order to finance a new giveaway to the wealthy and large corporations, he’s including provisions that benefit his very own industry,” said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for American Bridge, a Democratic political action committee. “This entire administration is set up to help Trump profit.”Over the years, Mr. Trump has used the special tax benefits that cover the real estate industry to his advantage. A $916 million net operating loss that he incurred in 1995 became useful because it could be carried forward to allow Mr. Trump to avoid paying income tax on future income for the next 20 years. That provision has been limited somewhat in the current version of the House plan.After the Reagan tax act, property prices declined because of a higher capital-gains tax rate and limits on deductions for some business losses.Those in the industry now hope that the president has not forgotten.', 'Top Russian Official Tried to Broker ‘Backdoor’ Meeting Between Trump and Putin - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — A senior Russian official who claimed to be acting at the behest of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia tried in May 2016 to arrange a meeting between Mr. Putin and Donald J. Trump, according to several people familiar with the matter.The news of this reached the Trump campaign in a very circuitous way. An advocate for Christian causes emailed campaign aides saying that Alexander Torshin, the deputy governor of the Russian central bank who has been linked both to Russia’s security services and organized crime, had proposed a meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump. The subject line of the email, turned over to Senate investigators, read, “Russian backdoor overture and dinner invite,” according to one person who has seen the message.The proposal made its way to the senior levels of the Trump campaign before Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and a top campaign aide, sent a message to top campaign officials rejecting it, according to two people who have seen Mr. Kushner’s message.Though the meeting never happened, Mr. Torshin’s request is the latest example of how the Russian government intensified its effort to contact and influence the Trump campaign last year as Mr. Trump was closing in on the Republican presidential nomination. It came just weeks after a self-described intermediary for the Russian government told a Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, that the Russians had “dirt” on Mr. Trump’s rival, Hillary Clinton, in the form of “thousands of emails.”Soon after Mr. Torshin’s outreach fizzled, Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, arranged a meeting at Trump Tower after being told that a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin would bring damaging information about Mrs. Clinton to the meeting.These contacts were set against the backdrop of a sophisticated effort by Russia to hack Democratic computers, disseminate propaganda and undermine Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy. The latest disclosure about Mr. Torshin, who is a leading figure in Mr. Putin’s party, United Russia, shows the direct involvement of a high-ranking Russian official in the Kremlin’s outreach to the campaign.The overture to the Trump campaign was first reported by CNN. The New York Times confirmed new details, including Mr. Torshin’s involvement and his claim to be acting on Mr. Putin’s behalf. In a letter on Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee accused Mr. Kushner of withholding the “backdoor overture” email, an accusation that Mr. Kushner’s lawyers denied.In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday, Abbe D. Lowell, a lawyer for Mr. Kushner, said that the Senate had asked for all documents related to Mr. Kushner’s contacts with the Russians and that he had responded. “Again, this was not any contact, call or meeting in which Mr. Kushner was involved,” Mr. Lowell said. “He is forwarded this long chain later on.”A special counsel for the Justice Department is investigating Russia’s campaign to disrupt the 2016 election, and whether any of Donald J.

Mr. Clay was organizing a dinner in Louisville, Ky., honoring wounded veterans, and Mr. Trump was scheduled to be in the city for the National Rifle Association’s annual convention. In the email to Mr. Dearborn, Mr. Clay said he hoped that Mr. Trump would attend the dinner, and he also included details about the overture from Mr. Torshin.The email said that the dinner would be a chance for Mr. Trump to meet Mr. Torshin, who is a life member of the National Rifle Association in the United States and a vocal advocate for gun rights in Russia, according to three people who have seen the email.The email said that the Russians believed they had “shared Christian values” with the Trump campaign.Mr. Torshin has established ties to Russia’s security establishment. He served in the upper house of the Russian Parliament and also sat on the country’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee, a separate government council that includes the director of the Federal Security Service, known as F.S.B., and the ministers of defense, interior and foreign affairs.Spanish investigators claim Mr. Torshin laundered money for the Russian mob through Spanish banks and properties while he was in Parliament. Mr. Torshin has denied the accusations.Mr. Clay said in a telephone interview on Friday that while the request seemed “very thin,” he did not think at the time that anyone in the Russian government was trying to interfere with the election. “That never ever, ever, ever entered my mind,” he said. “You look back at it now, and it actually causes you some pause.”Mr. Clay said he no longer had the email and could not remember its specifics. He recalled that Mr. Torshin and a former assistant, Maria Butina, made the request through a longtime friend, Johnny Yenason, of the Military Warriors Support Foundation, a veterans’ support organization. Mr. Yenason did not respond to messages seeking comment. Efforts to contact Mr. Torshin and Ms. Butina were unsuccessful.Mr. Dearborn forwarded the email to top campaign aides, including Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and Mr. Kushner, according to two people who have seen the exchange. Mr. Kushner replied that Mr. Dearborn should decline, saying people often claimed to be acting as intermediaries for powerful figures just to gain access to the campaign.“Pass on this,” Mr. Kushner said, according to Mr. Lowell’s letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, adding: “Most likely these people then go back home and claim they have special access to gain importance for themselves. Be careful.”Mr. Clay said Mr. Dearborn sent him a response rejecting the idea.“He told me it was inappropriate,” Mr. Clay said. “I agreed with him.”Neither Mr. Trump nor his campaign officials attended the veterans’ dinner, Mr. Clay said.

He said Americans will pull together to help the suffering and he pledged to continue monitoring the investigation during his lengthy Asian tour.The attack happened Sunday morning when a man dressed in black tactical-style gear and armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a church in a small South Texas community, killing 26 people and wounding at least 16 others in what the governor called the deadliest mass shooting in the state\'s history.Japan\'s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also offered his condolences, saying on Twitter: "I offer my deepest condolences for those who lost their lives in the incident that occurred in the U.S. state of Texas."He added: "My thoughts are with those who suffered injuries in the incident."The shooting comes just over a month after a gunman opened fire on an outdoor music festival on the Las Vegas Strip from the 32nd floor of a hotel-casino, killing 58 people and wounding more than 500. Trump traveled to Las Vegas several days after to meet with families of victims and first responders.___Associated Press writer Catherine Lucey in Washington contributed to this report.', 'DANANG, Vietnam – President Donald Trump marked his first Veterans Day in office saluting American veterans in Vietnam, home to one of the most polarizing conflicts in U.S. history.Trump on Friday traveled to Danang, Vietnam, site of an American air base during the war, and met with seven vets who had returned to the country where they lost comrades.Thanking the veterans, Trump said: "I got to know them for a few minutes upfront, and they are definitely tough, smart cookies. We like them. I think they like me too."He then encouraged the veterans, organized by a group called The Greatest Generation Foundation, to speak. Several praised Trump, including Max Morgan, whose voice cracked and began to cry as he talked about fallen veterans"From my heart, thank you for your support of the military, and it\'s an honor to be here as one of seven Vietnam veterans representing the 58,000 heroes who never made it home," said Morgan, of Santa Clarita, CA.Trump, who at times appears to struggle with displaying empathy, reached out to hug him. Trump signed a proclamation Friday honoring veterans of the Vietnam War, calling them "the heroes who fulfill your duty to our nation."On Twitter Friday, Trump honored the Marines, saying: "On behalf of an entire nation, Happy 242nd Birthday to the men and women of the United States Marines!"Trump was in Danang as part of a lengthy trip through Asia to attend an international summit. Many government agencies are marking the Nov. 11 holiday a day early because it falls on a Saturday.Like presidents before him, Trump has wrestled with the legacy of Vietnam. He did not serve but received draft deferments, one attained with a physician\'s letter stating that he suffered from bone spurs in his feet.In 2015, Trump derided Vietnam war hero Sen. John McCain, stating his fellow Republican wasn\'t a "war hero" and adding, "I like people who weren\'t captured." McCain spent more than five years as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down over North Vietnam in 1967.Over the decades, presidents have grappled with the conflict and its meaning for the country. President Lyndon Johnson abandoned his re-election quest after an escalation in the war led to more American deaths, while President Richard Nixon faced fierce criticism for expanding the conflict. President Bill Clinton\'s deferment before he entered the Vietnam draft generated considerable heat during the 1992 presidential campaign.More recently, questions about the service of George W. Bush and John Kerry were prominent in the 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns. Bush served in the Texas Air National Guard but faced scrutiny over his status and why he was never deployed overseas. Kerry was a decorated veteran who threw away his medals and testified against the war before Congress. His service record was questioned in campaign ads.', '', '', '                                    Ivana Trump\'s new book, "Raising Trump," is scheduled to be released next week.

Do you?’” “I said ‘Get lost. I love my husband.’ It was unladylike but I was in shock.”Donald Trump’s public affair with Marla Maples spawned the infamous "Best Sex I\'ve Ever Had" headline in the New York Post in 1990. After divorcing Ivana Trump, the future president married Maples in 1993."Raising Trump" is set to be released next week.In the book, Ivana writes glowingly about her marriage to Trump and her prominent role at the Trump Organization. But then she unburdens herself about the heartache that Trump\'s affair with Maples caused her and the couple\'s three children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric.She says Donald Jr. didn\'t speak to his father for a year after the split.“I can only shake my head at how it insane it was," Ivana Trump writes.

Who knows!”Trump said he wanted “to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill.”Schumer said through a spokesman Saturday that Trump "wanted to make another run at repeal and replace and I told the president that\'s off the table." Schumer said if Trump "wants to work together to improve the existing health care system, we Democrats are open to his suggestions."President Donald Trump walks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, to board the Marine One helicopter, Oct. 7, 2017(Associated Press)Trump has suggested before that he would be open to negotiating with Democrats on health care, but there have been no clear signs of a compromise between the two parties.Schumer said a starting point could be negotiations led by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., who have been discussing a limited bipartisan deal to stabilize state-level markets for individual health insurance policies. People covered under the health law represent about half of those who purchase individual policies.Trump irritated GOP leaders in Congress when he reached a deal with Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on a spending bill and the debt ceiling. The president has referred to those two Democrats as "Chuck and Nancy."But the Trump administration announced Friday that it would allow more employers to opt out of no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious or moral objections. The move was one more attempt to roll back Obama\'s health overhaul, prompting Democrats to question whether Trump is committed to avoiding sabotaging the law.Trump floated the potential talks as he approved an emergency declaration for a large part of Louisiana and ordered federal assistance for the state as Hurricane Nate approached the central Gulf of Mexico.The president headlined a fundraiser on Saturday night in Greensboro, N.C., to benefit his Trump Victory joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee. The event was expected to raise $2 million, with donors paying up to $35,000 per couple to serve as co-hosts.The Associated Press contributed to this story.', '\'MediaBuzz\' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the escalating war of words between Republican Senator Bob Corker and President Trump.Well, so much for Republican unity.On the morning that Donald Trump tried to bring his party’s senators together at a White House lunch, a war of words erupted between the president and the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.And by the afternoon, Arizona Republican Jeff Flake blistered Trump from the Senate floor in announcing that he, like Bob Corker, won’t run again.Flake, who faced a tough reelection battle, ratcheted up his rhetoric, saying that "reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior has been excused and countenanced as telling it like it is." He said there was a "flagrant disregard for decency" that came "from the top of our government," and this was "dangerous to a democracy…I will not be complicit or silent."If you take a step back, this is truly extraordinary: Two prominent Republican senators, Flake and Bob Corker, using incendiary language against a president of their own party and deciding to forfeit their jobs. Trump had already dismissed Jeff Flake as, well, a flake.John McCain praised his fellow Arizonan. But the Steve Bannon wing of the GOP will undoubtedly be pleased at getting rid of two Trump critics and trying to replace them with more reliable lawmakers. But the 2018 departures also provide an opening for the Democrats.On a day that was supposed to be devoted to tax reform, Corker hit Trump with so many jabs—on television, on Twitter, on the Hill—that I started losing track. And Trump repeatedly punched back.I know, I know. We’ve already been through a couple of rounds of the great Trump-Corker slugfest, with warnings of World War III and all that. But this has risen to a whole new level.The Corker feud isn’t hard to grasp: These guys don’t like each other, and the Tennessee senator isn’t running for reelection. He made the morning TV rounds.Corker on "Today": The White House should "step aside" on tax reform.Corker on "CBS This Morning": "It appears to be the governing model of this White House to purposefully divide."Corker on CNN: "I don’t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and is debasing our country."Trump on Twitter: "Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn\'t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts."Corker on Twitter: "same untruths from an utterly untruthful president. #AlertTheDaycareStaff."Trump on Twitter: "Sen. Corker is the incompetent head of the Foreign Relations Committee, & look how poorly the U.S. has done. He doesn\'t have a clue as ...the entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us. People like liddle\' Bob Corker have set the U.S. way back."Then TV reporters grabbed Corker in a Senate hallway and cable networks took it live as he continued to trash Trump.For a guy who called the White House an adult day care center, he isn’t acting like the adult in the room.And Trump, as we all know, can’t resist hitting back.All this amounts to a sideshow as the party continues to wrestle with tax reform. But it’s certainly not making that struggle any easier.Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m.). He is the author of five books and is based in Washington.

He had previously worked at The Associated Press, where he won a variety of awards for coverage of Bill Clinton.While only Millsappeared to take pleasure in the awkward image by tweeting it out, it should be noted that The Associated Press, Reuters and AFP published similar photos.The New York Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Brian Flood covers the media for Fox News.

Loser!The anti-Trump host of CNN’s morning show, “New Day,” Chris Cuomo used Trump’s tweet as an opportunity to finagle landing an interview with the president that will probably never occur. Cuomo regularly mocks Trump on social media and the newsman\'s older brother Andrew, the Democratic governor of New York, is known to harbor presidential aspirations. The “New Day” host has also been hostile toward Kellyanne Conway, a key member of the administration who has nonetheless appeared on his show.Hope you are watching @NewDay again this morning. As always, you are welcome to come on and discuss what matters to the American people. https://t.co/JMAEfqkHfrMedia Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor said the media is “obsessed with Trump\'s criticism of their work” and pointed out that former President Obama was handled differently.“Obama started feuding with opposition press during the campaign, kicking off reporters from his campaign plane after their outlets endorsed his opponent. Obama then spent his whole presidency attacking media critics -- CNBC, Fox News and Drudge among them -- yet somehow the major media didn\'t mind,” Gainor told Fox News.“Obama then spent his whole presidency attacking media critics… yet somehow the major media didn\'t mind.”It’s not 100 percent clear who the “loser” is that President Trump was referring to during his early morning tweet, but CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker was presumably on his mind. Zucker’s programming strategy is essentially to attack Trump, and their rocky relationship goes way back.Zucker wasin charge of NBC when Trump’s “The Apprentice”became a hitfor the network. At one point, when NBC\'s prime time lineup was flailing, "The Apprentice" was NBC\'s most successful show and Trump its biggest star. Zucker haseven acknowledged in the pastthat his decision to greenlight “The Apprentice” helped increase Trump’s star power.When Zucker was fired at NBC, he eventually landed at CNN where his anti-Trump game plan has helped both TV ratings and digital traffic at CNN – meaning Trump helped ratings at both of Zucker’s gigs in some capacity. Meanwhile, Trump claims he\'s the reason Zucker got the top NBC job (something Zucker gently refutes) and the president has been clear that he resents CNN\'s constant attacks on him.CNN, once famously known for Ted Turner\'s bare bones"just-the-facts" approach to journalism, has shifted hard left, with its vocal anchors and correspondents sometimes outdoing even MSNBC.Trump calls CNN “fake news” on a regular basis and the network’s senior White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, has emerged as one of the faces of anti-Trump liberal media, relentlessly interrupting press briefings with grandstanding and providing personal opinions about the administration on a regular basis.Trump has literally pointed at Acosta and said, “You’re fake news,” at various press conferences.Zucker’s anti-Trump programming strategy could end up killing an $84.5 billion deal between AT&T and Time Warner, as conflicting reports have comes out regarding whether or not the Department of Justice will tell AT&T that Time Warner must sell CNN in order to approve the $84.5 billion acquisition. There is widespread speculation within the media industry that Zucker will lose his job over the situation.It is actually hard to believe how naive (or dumb) the Failing @nytimes is when it comes to foreign policy...weak and ineffective!Trump had a busy day on Twitter, as he also attacked the “failing” New York Times and pondered if the UCLA basketball players who were arrested for shoplifting in China will thank him for helping with their release.Brian Flood covers the media for Fox News. Follow him on Twitter at @briansflood.', 'WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump plans to deliver a broad and harsh critique of Iran in a speech Friday declaring that the landmark Iran nuclear deal is not in America\'s national security interests, according to U.S. officials and outside advisers to the administration.Trump\'s speech from the White House will outline specific faults he finds in the 2015 accord but will also focus on an array of Iran\'s troubling non-nuclear activities, four officials and advisers said. Those include Tehran\'s ballistic missile program, support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon\'s Hezbollah movement and other groups that destabilize the region.Under U.S. law, Trump faces a Sunday deadline to notify Congress whether Iran is complying with the accord that was painstakingly negotiated over 18 months by the Obama administration and determine if it remains a national security priority. Although Trump intends to say Iran is living up to the letter of the agreement, he will make the case that the deal is fatally flawed and that its non-nuclear behavior violates the spirit of the regional stability it was intended to encourage, the officials and advisers said.The officials and advisers, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly preview the speech, said Trump will not call for a re-imposition of nuclear sanctions on Tehran. He will urge lawmakers to codify tough new requirements for Tehran to continue to benefit from the sanctions relief that it won in exchange for curbing its atomic program. And he\'ll announce his long-anticipated intent to impose sanctions on Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard Corps by designating it a terrorist organization under an existing executive order, according to the officials and advisers.In addition, Trump will ask Congress to amend or replace outright the legislation that currently requires him to certify Iranian compliance every 90 days. Officials have said that Trump hates the requirement more than the nuclear deal itself because it forces him to take a position on what he has denounced as the worst deal in American history every three months. That frequency has also irritated aides who have complained that they are spending inordinate amounts of time on certification at the expense other issues.At the White House, Trump\'s chief of staff, John Kelly, confirmed the president would announce the results of his Iran policy review on Friday but declined to offer any detail. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was calling foreign minister colleagues from the other parties to the deal to brief them on what to expect, the State Department said.But in a possible preview of Trump\'s announcement, CIA Director Mike Pompeo blasted Iran during a speech at the University of Texas, calling Iran\'s Ministry of Intelligence and Revolutionary Guard "cudgels of a despotic theocracy."The IRGC, which is responsible for external operations, is expanding its power across the Middle East, Pompeo said. "Unlike ISIS and its mirage of a caliphate, Iran is now a powerful nation-state that remains the world\'s largest state sponsor of terror."White House aides initially sought a venue for Trump\'s address that would project American power and determination. The shuttered former Iranian embassy in Washington was briefly considered before being deemed inappropriate. Officials also considered the Iwo Jima Marine Corps Memorial, which was ruled out because it is currently being renovated.American allies, who have pressed the White House to remain in the nuclear accord, will be closely watching the president\'s address. Trump wants to impress on the European parties to the accord — Germany, France and Britain — the importance of fixing what he sees as flaws in the nuclear accord and addressing malign behavior not covered in the agreement.The Europeans, along with the other parties, Iran, Russia and China, have ruled out reopening the deal. But some, notably France, have signaled a willingness to tackle unresolved issues in supplementary negotiations. Among those issues are the expiration of several restrictions on advanced nuclear activity under so-called "sunset clauses" that will allow Iran to begin ramping up its enrichment capabilities after 10 years, the end of an arms embargo and the eventual easing of demands for a halt to its missile program.In the speech, Trump hopes to "recruit" the Europeans into joining his broad strategy, particularly by punishing the Revolutionary Guard, which he and his national security team believe is fomenting instability, violence and extremism throughout the Middle East and beyond, according to one official.In anticipation of Trump\'s announcements, Republican legislators have drawn up new versions of the law replacing the current 90-day timetable with "semi-annual" certifications, according to two drafts seen by the Associated Press this week.Both drafts, one from Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker., and one from committee member and harsh deal critic Sen. Tom Cotton, expand the U.S. certification criteria to include items that are also the province of the U.N. nuclear watchdog and require the U.S. intelligence community to determine if Iran is carrying out illicit activity in facilities to which the International Atomic Energy Agency has not had access.The certification would also demand that the intelligence community produce judgments on Iranian behavior not covered by the nuclear deal, including missile testing and development, backing for Hezbollah and Assad and threats to Israel and the Mideast more broadly, according to the drafts.___Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.', '', '                                    Bears Ears National Monument near Blanding, Utah, is one of four monuments recommended for reduction by the Interior Secretary                                                                            (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)                                                                    President Donald Trump is shrinking two national monuments in Utah, accepting the recommendation of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to reverse protections established by two Democratic presidents to more than 3.6 million acres. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he was "incredibly grateful" that Trump called him on Friday to say he is approving Zinke\'s proposal on Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. He and Trump "believe in the importance of protecting these sacred antiquities," but there is "a better way to do it" by working with local officials and tribes, Hatch said. Hatch\'s office said Trump said, "I\'m approving the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase recommendation for you, Orrin." White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders would not confirm that Trump will shrink the Utah monuments, saying she did not want to "get ahead of the president\'s announcement." Zinke recommended that the two Utah monuments be shrunk, along with Nevada\'s Gold Butte and Oregon\'s Cascade-Siskiyou. Zinke\'s recommendation, made public in September, prompted an outcry from environmental groups who promised to take the Trump administration to court to block any attempts to rescind or reduce the monument designations. The two Utah monuments encompass more than 3.6 million acres -- an area larger than Connecticut -- and were created by Democratic administrations under a century-old law that allows presidents to protect sites considered historic, geographically or culturally important. Bears Ears, designated for federal protection by former President Barack Obama, totals 1.3 million acres in southeastern Utah on rugged land that is sacred to Native Americans and home to tens of thousands of archaeological sites, including ancient cliff dwellings and petroglyphs. Grand Staircase-Escalante, in southern Utah, includes nearly 1.9 million acres in a sweeping vista larger than the state of Delaware. Republicans have howled over the monument designation since its creation in 1996 by former President Bill Clinton. Trump ordered a review of 27 sites earlier this year following complaints by Hatch and other Republicans that the 1906 Antiquities Act had been misused to create oversized monuments that hinder energy development, logging and other uses. Trump called the monument designations a "massive land grab" that "should never have happened." The review included sweeping sites mostly in the West that are home to ancient cliff dwellings, towering sequoia trees, deep canyons or ocean habitats roamed by seals, whales and sea turtles. National monument designations add protections for lands revered for their natural beauty and historical significance with the goal of preserving them for future generations. The restrictions aren\'t as stringent as national parks, but some policies include limits on mining, timber cutting and recreational activities such as riding off-road vehicles. No president has tried to eliminate a monument, but they have trimmed and redrawn boundaries 18 times, according to the National Park Service. Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said it was "a disgrace" that Trump was moving to undo Bears Ears, which she described as "the nation\'s first national monument created to honor Native American cultural heritage." Suh called it "a travesty" that Trump was "trying to unravel a century\'s worth of conservation history -- all behind closed doors," adding: "The American people want these special places protected." The Republican-led San Juan County, Utah commission welcomed Trump\'s action on Bears Ears. The three-member panel objected to the monument designation, saying it was too large and could hurt residents\' ability to earn a living from livestock grazing. They contend there are other ways to protect the area and said the monument declaration attracts more visitors who could potentially damage the ruins and rock art. "We take heart in our shared belief that the people of San Juan will continue to take special care of these magnificent lands ... for future generations," the commissioners said in a statement. Davis Filfred, a Navajo Nation lawmaker who supports the monument designation, called Trump\'s action unfair. Tribal groups have vowed to sue over any reduction to Bears Ears, but Filfred said Trump "has been sued so many times already I don\'t know if that means anything to him."

However, he’s now claiming that the first lady, Melania Trump, is a fan of his over-the-top Trump character.Speaking on Monday’s episode of WNYC’s “The Brian Lehrer Show,” the 59-year-old actor made the bold claim that FLOTUS is into both “SNL” and Baldwin’s impression, despite her husband’s very public insistence that it’s bad.“Someone told me, who is friends with someone in the White House, or formerly in the White House, that Melania Trump loves ‘SNL’ and she loves my impersonation,” he said, later alleging that Melania believes his portrayal of her husband of 12 years is right on the money.Melania Trump(Reuters)Unfortunately for the former “30 Rock” star, the first lady’s director of communications, Stephanie Grisham, refuted Baldwin’s claim in an e-mail to Newsweek.“That is not true, which is why Mr. Baldwin has no actual names to go with his bizarre assertion.”As The Washington Post notes, Donald Trump has been very vocal about his distaste for the constant parodies of him from the long-running sketch show, and has even commented on Baldwin’s performance directly on Twitter.“Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable!” he said in December of 2016. “Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can’t get any worse.

Here\'s what declaring it an emergency will do.Calling it a “national shame” and “human tragedy,” President Trump on Thursday declared the opioid epidemic crippling American communitiesa “public health emergency” and pledged federal resources to help combat the growing problem.“Addressing it will require all of our effort, and it will require us to confront the crisis in all of its real complexity,” Trump said during a speech in the East Room of the White House.“As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue,” Trump said. “It is time to liberate our communities from the scourge. ... We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.”Trump spoke to an audience at the White House that included family members of those affected by the opioid crisis, as well as several administration officials and elected leaders.The president, who said “not one part of American society has been spared” from the crisis, stopped short of calling it a national emergency, something he previously promised he’d do. The announcement follows months of debate on how to tackle the problem.\'We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.\'Trump himself has gone on record more than once saying he would declare the crisis a national emergency. Such a designation would allow states to tap into the same federal funds typically reserved for natural disasters like hurricanes through the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.HERE\'S WHAT A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY MEANSInstead, Trump signed a presidential memo that directs acting Health and Human Services Secretary Eric Hargan to declare a public health emergency under the Public Health Services Act -- which directs federal agencies to provide more grant money to combat the epidemic.White House officials say the step helps cut through regulatory red tape and gives states more flexibility in how they use federal funds to fight the problem.The designation will also allow changes such as expanded access to medical services in rural areas.It doesn’t, however, create any additional funding. The emergency declaration will last 90 days but can be renewed.In 2015, 33,091 people died from opioid overdose, while 12.5 million people misused prescription opioids, according to the most recent statistics available from the Department of Health and Human Services. The president on Thursday also revealed plans to take an “evil” opioid off the market immediately as well as the government’s intention to bring lawsuits against some of the drug makers, though he did not provide specifics. He also vowed to crack down on heroin imports from Mexico and fentanyl imports from China.Pharmaceutical fentanyl is an opiate drug that’s up to 100 times more potent than morphine. In the past, drug dealers used it to spike the potency of the heroin they sold but traffickers are now selling fentanyl by itself.Drug deaths involving fentanyl increased nearly 600 percent from 2014 to 2016, The Washington Post reported. There were 582 fatal overdoses linked to the synthetic drug in 2014. Last year, the number jumped to 3,946.Trump also discussed the alcohol addiction that claimed his older brother Fred’s life in 1981.“[Fred] had a problem with alcohol, and he would tell me, ‘Don’t drink, don’t drink,’” Trump said.The president said watching his brother as well as other friends struggle with addiction is what set him on a no-drug, no-alcohol, no-cigarette path.“There is nothing desirable about drugs,” Trump said. “They’re bad.”Trump vowed to tackle the opioid crisis on the campaign trail, but critics claim his administration has been slow to act.Trump created a presidential commission that in August recommended he declare the crisis a national emergency.“Your declaration would empower your Cabinet to take bold steps and would force Congress to focus on funding and empowering the executive branch even further to deal with this loss of life,” the Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis wrote. “It would also awaken every American to this simple fact: If this scourge has not found you or your family yet, without bold action by everyone, it soon will.”However, White House officials told reporters Thursday morning that a national emergency declaration was not necessary in the case of opioids.The public health emergency will "reorient all of the federal government and executive branch resources toward focusing on providing relief to this urgent need.”Past instances of public health emergencies include the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009.Since the commission released its report, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has stepped down from his post while Trump’s pick for drug czar, Rep. Tom Marino, withdrew his nomination.At an event at the Heritage Foundation earlier Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said it’s important to “reestablish the view that people should say no to drugs.”“I do think this whole country needs to not be so lackadaisical about drugs,” he said. “Much of the addiction starts with marijuana. It is not a harmless drug.”', 'WASHINGTON – The Latest on President Donald Trump\'s tweets of anti-Muslim videos (all times local):8:00 p.m.President Donald Trump says in a tweet that British Prime Minister Theresa May should focus not on him but "on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom."Trump\'s comment comes amid criticism, including from May\'s office, of his decision Wednesday morning to retweet a string of inflammatory videos from a fringe British political group purporting to show violence being committed by Muslims.May\'s office said it was "wrong" for the president to have done so.Trump\'s tweet uses the wrong handle to address May.But he\'s telling her: "We are doing just fine!"___6:25 p.m.President Donald Trump is stoking the same anti-Islam sentiments he fanned on the campaign trail.On Wednesday, Trump retweeted a string of inflammatory videos from a fringe British political group purporting to show violence being committed by Muslims.The tweets drew a sharp condemnation from British Prime Minister Theresa May\'s office, which said it was "wrong for the president to have done this."White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump was simply promoting border security and suggested that verifying the content was not a top concern.Trump made anti-Muslim comments one hallmark of his Republican presidential campaign and has previously retweeted inflammatory posts from controversial Twitter accounts including some with apparent ties to white nationalist groups.

"He\'s been terrific," Trump said, in an apparent reference to Xi.Asked about the case Tuesday, China\'s foreign ministry said it had no additional comment. On Monday, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that three American men were being investigated in the eastern city of Hangzhou for alleged theft and that China and the U.S. were in contact over the matter."China will handle this case in accordance with law and protect the lawful rights and interests of the people involved," Geng said.Chinese authorities detained the UCLA freshmen for questioning about allegations of shoplifting before a recent game against Georgia Tech in Shanghai. The UCLA team returned to the U.S. without them on Saturday.The Los Angeles Times has identified the players as Cody Riley, Jalen Hill and LiAngelo Ball — the brother of Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball.Citing a source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation, sports channel ESPN last week reported the players could be Hangzhou for "a week or two" while the situation is resolved. The source told ESPN there is surveillance footage of the players shoplifting from three stores inside a high-end retail center.', 'I Believe Juanita - The New York TimesOn Friday evening the MSNBC host Chris Hayes sent out a tweet that electrified online conservatives: “As gross and cynical and hypocritical as the right’s ‘what about Bill Clinton’ stuff is, it’s also true that Democrats and the center left are overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against him.” Hayes’s tweet inspired stories on Glenn Beck’s The Blaze, Breitbart and The Daily Caller, all apparently eager to use the Clinton scandals to derail discussions about Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for the United States Senate in Alabama who is accused of sexually assaulting minors.Yet despite the right’s evident bad faith, I agree with Hayes. In this #MeToo moment, when we’re reassessing decades of male misbehavior and turning open secrets into exposes, we should look clearly at the credible evidence that Juanita Broaddrick told the truth when she accused Clinton of raping her. But revisiting the Clinton scandals in light of today’s politics is complicated as well as painful. Democrats are guilty of apologizing for Clinton when they shouldn’t have. At the same time, looking back at the smear campaign against the Clintons shows we can’t treat the feminist injunction to “believe women” as absolute.Writing at Crooked.com, Brian Beutler warns that in future elections, right-wing propaganda will exploit the progressive commitment to always taking sexual abuse charges seriously. It’s easy to imagine an outlet like Breitbart leveraging the “believe women” rallying cry to force mainstream media coverage of dubious accusations.The Clinton years, in which epistemological warfare emerged as a key part of the Republican political arsenal, show us why we should be wary of allegations that bubble up from the right-wing press. At the time, the reactionary billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife was bankrolling the Arkansas Project, which David Brock, the former right-wing journalist who played a major role in it, described as a “multimillion-dollar dirty tricks operation against the Clintons.” Various figures in conservative media accused Bill Clinton of murder, drug-running and using state troopers as pimps. Brock alleges that right-wing figures funneled money to some of Clinton’s accusers.In this environment, it would have been absurd to take accusations of assault and harassment made against Clinton at face value. On Monday, Caitlin Flanagan, perhaps taking up Hayes’s challenge, urged liberals to remember some of what Clinton is said to have done. “Kathleen Willey said that she met him in the Oval Office for personal and professional advice and that he groped her, rubbed his erect penis on her, and pushed her hand to his crotch,” Flanagan wrote, recalling the charges Willey first made in 1998. It sounds both familiar and plausible. But Willey also accused the Clintons of having her husband and then her cat killed. Must we believe that, too?Similarly, there are reasons to be at least unsure about Paula Jones’s claim that Clinton exposed himself to her and demanded oral sex. Jones was championed by people engaged in what Ann Coulter once proudly called “a small, intricately knit right-wing conspiracy” to bring down the president. She described “distinguishing characteristics” of Clinton’s penis that turned out to be inaccurate. Her sister insisted to Sidney Blumenthal, then a New Yorker writer, that she was lying. Should feminists have backed her anyway? I’m still not sure, but the evidence was less definitive than that against Harvey Weinstein, Trump or Moore.Of the Clinton accusers, the one who haunts me is Broaddrick. The story she tells about Clinton recalls those we’ve heard about Weinstein. She claimed they had plans to meet in a hotel coffee shop, but at the last minute he asked to come up to her hotel room instead, where he raped her. Five witnesses said she confided in them about the assault right after it happened. It’s true that she denied the rape in an affidavit to Paula Jones’s lawyers, before changing her story when talking to federal investigators. But her explanation, that she didn’t want to go public but couldn’t lie to the F.B.I., makes sense. Put simply, I believe her.What to do with that belief? Contemplating this history is excruciating in part because of the way it has been weaponized against Hillary Clinton. Broaddrick sees her as complicit, interpreting something Hillary once said to her at a political event — “I want you to know that we appreciate everything you do for Bill” — as a veiled threat instead of a rote greeting. This seems wildly unlikely; Broaddrick was decades away from going public, and most reporting about the Clinton marriage shows Bill going to great lengths to hide his betrayals. Nevertheless, one of the sick ironies of the 2016 campaign was that it was Hillary who had to pay the political price for Bill’s misdeeds, as they were trotted out to deflect attention from Trump’s well-documented transgressions.And now they’re being trotted out again. It’s fair to conclude that because of Broaddrick’s allegations, Bill Clinton no longer has a place in decent society. But we should remember that it’s not simply partisan tribalism that led liberals to doubt her. Discerning what might be true in a blizzard of lies isn’t easy, and the people who spread those lies don’t get to claim the moral high ground. We should err on the side of believing women, but sometimes, that belief will be used against us.', 'A Trump for All Ages - The New York Times', 'Reaction from Tom Dupree, former deputy assistant attorney general.Since President Donald Trump took office, he has been consistently strategic in working to dismantle the radical, leftwing legacy of his predecessor.While the mainstream media has fixated on exaggerated day-to-day mini-controversies, the Trump Administration has methodically eliminated job-killing Obama-era regulations, filled judicial vacancies with solid conservatives at an astonishing pace, and accomplished real breakthroughs in trade relations with China and the Middle East.Now, the President is going after another Obama-era creation: the dangerously unaccountable Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).Long time readers of this newsletter know that I have opposed the CFPB on constitutional and economic grounds for years. I’ve written about the agency’s mafia-like tactics as well as the threat its behavior poses to the rule of law. I have even testified before Congress about the danger this agency poses.This CFPB was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and was largely designed by radical Senator Elizabeth Warren when she was an Obama advisor. Since the beginning, it has been used as a political weapon by the far Left as a way to intimidate businesses that the Left opposes ideologically.The CFPB consistently oversteps its bounds. It is prohibited from regulating car deals, yet it does so anyway. It is prohibited from collecting personal data from consumers, yet it does so at a scale that rivals the NSA’s most controversial data gathering operations.Further, the CFPB draws its funding from the Federal Reserve’s operating expenses rather than annual appropriations – making it unaccountable to Congress. The writers of Dodd-Frank also specified that the director could only be removed by the president – and only under specific circumstances. This undermines both congressional and executive powers. Essentially, the bureau can do whatever it wants – without fear of losing its funding or its leadership.The bureau’s creators claim it needed this unique autonomy from Congress and the president so it could operate free of politics. However, it appears what the CFPB really wanted was a shield against conservative politics. The Washington Examiner found that political donations from bureau employees have been overwhelmingly Democratic. Since 2011, 593 CFPB employees have donated a total of $114,859 to Democratic candidates or groups, while only one employee has given to a Republican – $1,000 to Mitt Romney in 2012. In other words, the CFPB is the perfect example of an out-of-control, wholly unaccountable, politically-motivated bureaucracy. It is one of the deepest bogs in the swamp.The best possible evidence of this agency’s assumed autonomy is illustrated by the ludicrous fight that has unfolded over the past few days.Former CFPB Director Richard Cordray announced his resignation the day after Thanksgiving, with eight months left in his term. However, before officially departing Friday, he made his chief of staff, Leandra English, the agency’s deputy director, which under Dodd-Frank, would set her up to become acting director in his stead.However, President Trump exercised his executive power to fill federal vacancies and appointed OMB Director Mick Mulvaney – a fierce critic of the CFPB – as acting director. English is now making an absurd grab for power by suing the Trump Administration. Despite the CFPB’s general counsel acknowledging Mulvaney is the legal acting director, English claims President Trump doesn’t have the authority to appoint him.English’s grandstanding only proves the contemptuous, bureaucratic arrogance of the culture surrounding this deeply flawed federal agency. The Left simply believes the law does not apply to them.Not surprisingly, the national media continues to treat English’s ridiculous claim as legitimate – even after U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly on Tuesday denied her request for a restraining order to keep Mulvaney from leading the agency.In his ruling, Judge Kelly said, “Denying the President\'s authority to appoint Mr. Mulvaney raises significant constitutional questions."This is another fight that President Trump has won – and it couldn’t have happened quickly enough.Congress and the President should now work to abolish the CFPB as soon as possible, or at the very least, bring this rogue agency back under the rule of law.Newt Gingrich is a Fox News contributor.

His latest book is "Understanding Trump."', 'The New Democratic Party - The New York TimesA year ago this week, America made what I believe history will record as one of the greatest electoral mistakes in the life of the nation: It elected Donald Trump president of the United States.It did so while drowning in Russia-produced propaganda, under a torrent of Russia-stolen emails, facing the stiff arm of renewed voter suppression, and on the watch of a splintering and dysfunctional Democratic Party.All of those caveats are valid and necessary, but they don’t undo what has been done. They rightly call into question the legitimacy of Trump’s presidency, but they don’t nullify it.The only remedy is removal, and that’s a very high bar, although recent moves in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation have renewed hopes.How did we get here?This is becoming old saw: Russia stole and published emails and also generated fake news, all in an attempt to hurt Hillary Clinton’s chances of being elected and therefore to aid Trump’s chances. What is new is knowledge of the overwhelming extent of Russia’s meddling and how it was aimed specifically at widening America’s divisions.As Facebook’s general counsel testified to a Senate committee last week, 126 million Americans may have been exposed to Russia-generated content on that platform alone. As a point of reference, only 137.5 million Americans voted in the 2016 election.Russia used American technology and American companies as weapons against American democracy.The Democratic Party, or at least many of its highest-profile figureheads from the last election, is locked in a vicious cycle of re-examinations and recriminations. The latest of those is the controversial new political memoir, “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House,” by Donna Brazile, about serving as acting head of the Democratic National Committee during the last legs of the campaign.The book is dishy on a personal level but damaging on a political level. Maybe that’s the point. As Joy-Ann Reid wrote on The Daily Beast, “Donna Brazile may be burning the village in order to save it.”But at a time when Trump is scrambling for anything at all to distract from Mueller’s plodding — and fruitful — investigation, is it the right time to start a three-alarm?I don’t begrudge anyone the right to tell his or her own story, but my focus now is on protecting the country from Trump, and nothing else.Brazile contended on ABC’s “This Week” that there would be no truly good time for her to release her book, and that people questioning the timing could “go to hell.” The problem is that we’re already in hell and trying to dig our way out, and many of us are crestfallen when any obstacle is added that might impede that effort.A Newsweek cover story last week declared, “Trump is Leading the Most Corrupt Administration in U.S. History, One of First-Class Kleptocrats.” He is a joke on the international stage. He is pushing us closer to an unthinkable nuclear conflict with North Korea. He is inflaming racial tensions by siding with the racists. His Justice Department is chipping away at civil rights. His Environmental Protection Agency is seemingly trying to do everything at odds with protecting the environment. And now Trump and the Republicans want to give the rich a giant wet kiss of a tax break.The reign of Trump is the reign of ruin. That is why the Resistance is needed now more than ever.And that’s the good news. The Resistance is strong and resolute, passionate and focused. The historic Women’s March has continued its work with a convention last month in Detroit. Resistance groups like Indivisible have continued their organizing and pressure. Indivisible now boasts that “across the nation, over 5,800 local groups (at least two in every congressional district) are using the Indivisible Guide to hold their members of Congress accountable.” And, as CNN reported on Saturday, there is an overwhelming surge of Democratic women interested in running for office.More people in polls appear to be waking to the reality that Trump is a walking failure who built his legend and his fortune on the lies that he was savvy and shrewd and a consummate deal maker. They are also waking to the very real possibility that all these Trump campaign contacts with Russians that everyone on the campaign seemed to forget may not be an epidemic of amnesia, but instead a widespread effort to cover something up.Liberals have the will and determination to turn this giant mistake around, to pressure their elected officials or possibly replace them. They have the resolve to resist Trump by every means at their disposal, while clinging to the hope that he might one day be replaced.The only issue I see is that these efforts seem to be operating separately from the national Democratic Party, a dinosaur of bureaucratic machinery in an evolved age of direct democratic action.Liberalism has leapt over the Democratic Party. Liberalism has its eye on a new beginning, while the mainstream party is stuck looking backward and bickering. The Resistance isn’t part of the old Democratic Party; The Resistance is the new Democratic Party, or at least its future.', 'HONG KONG – Some businesses in Asia are bracing for the unexpected as President Donald Trump traverses the region and meets with the leaders of major U.S. trading partners. Exporters are apprehensive, given Trump\'s penchant for unpredictability, his vehement dislike for swollen U.S. trade deficits, and his threats to rip up trade deals.Trump began his tour in Japan, where he vowed to reshape the trading relationship, saying it\'s "not fair and it\'s not open." He arrived in South Korea on Tuesday and will next travel to China, Vietnam and the Philippines, including stops at three regional summits. That allows him plenty of chances to showcase his assertive style and make off-the-cuff remarks that could leave his hosts and adversaries scrambling to react.Here\'s a look at the mood among a few U.S. and Asian businesses watching the trip.___OFF THE SCRIPTTrump\'s tendency to make impromptu announcements and his frequent threats to punish trading partners have brought heightened uncertainty to overseas presidential visits that traditionally are meticulously choreographed, said Rick Helfenbein, president of the Washington-based American Apparel & Footwear Association trade group."We have an unscripted president going into an unscripted environment, so you never know what he\'s going to do," he said.Trump may announce some big deals by U.S. companies selling to China to help lower the trade deficit, said Jake Parker, vice-president of the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing, a group seeking fair access to China\'s market.Or he might opt for a harder line, such as trade investigations that could invite retaliation."Our companies are frankly concerned about the types of retaliation that would come along with a more assertive China strategy," Parker said. There are fears any Chinese government retaliation "would be very visible, and would target high profile U.S. brands that are operating in China.""Our companies frankly don\'t want to be caught in that kind of crossfire," he said.___SUPPLY CHAINSExport manufacturers already are on "high alert" over possible disruptions to their global supply chains because of stalled talks with Canada and Mexico on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement, Helfenbein said. Trump has blasted NAFTA as a job-killer and wants it revamped or else he may pull out.That\'s left companies in North America looking for alternative manufacturing locations, Helfenbein said."Right now what looks stable to them is Asia," Helfenbein said. "If Asia gets disrupted by this president\'s trip then, oh my God. What are these companies going to do? Because that\'s part of their strategic planning and strategic thinking."For some manufacturers, like Hong Kong LED-bulb maker Keyart Industries Ltd., there\'s little to do but wait and see what happens."It\'s out of our control," said General Manager Brian Lau. "We\'re worried but there\'s nothing we can do about it."He said hopefully the "trade is going be there" no matter who is president.Keyart\'s joint venture plant in southern China\'s factory heartland of Guangdong province exports to the U.S. and Europe. For electronic and electrical goods makers, moving operations would be difficult because of China\'s vast and intricate supplier network."Americans don\'t really make these lamps, so where are you going to buy them from?" Lau said. If the U.S. slaps tariffs on Chinese-made goods, "the cost is ultimately going to be put back on customers."___BIGGER WORRIESOther manufactures shrugged off Trump\'s threats, saying they have bigger concerns, such as brutal competition from local rivals."What can he do about it? Business, it recognizes only profit," said Shaun Cai of Ceeport Samaf, a Guangdong toilet maker that exports to the U.S., Australia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.Exchange rates, specifically the dollar\'s weakness against the Chinese yuan over the past year, are another headache."When the rate comes down we get less (yuan from dollars) and we\'re losing money," Cai said. "If it goes down too far we have to ask the client to pay more. We need to raise the price for them and that\'s not good because they won\'t be happy."___KOREAN JITTERSBusinesses in South Korea are watching for remarks by Trump about the South Korea and U.S. free trade agreement, dubbed KORUS. The two sides are negotiating adjustments to the deal, and South Korean companies fret their industries might be singled out."There are worries among some sectors with big exports to the U.S., such as autos, while steel and consumer electronics are more concerned over regulations on imports," said Lee Jong-myoung, a director at the Korea Chamber of Commerce & Industry.Trump\'s other main goal on this trip is mustering support to pressure North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. That raises the chance he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could resume trading insults and threats, escalating tensions and possibly scaring off overseas investors."Lots of foreign investors in our country, they are very sensitive about the North Korean issue," Roy Seo, a salesman at LED lightmaker Prism, said while visiting a recent Hong Kong trade fair. "So if they are worrying about the war crisis or any other events that are going to happen in the near future, I think they\'re going to take out all their money because it\'s too dangerous."___Associated Press writer Youkyung Lee in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report.', 'TOKYO – President Donald Trump can expect a friendly reception in Japan, his first stop on a five-nation Asia trip that kicks off Sunday.He and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe largely see eye-to-eye on how to deal with the vexing problem of North Korea\'s weapons development, even if a solution remains elusive. America\'s trade deficit with Japan could be a point of contention, though Trump has aimed his recent rhetoric on trade at China, not Japan.The two leaders will meet on the golf course Sunday before holding formal talks on Monday. A look at what\'s on tap:NORTH KOREANorth Korea\'s rapid advances in missile development are making the potential threat much more real for both Japan and the United States. As it seeks to send missiles farther, North Korea has test-launched two over northern Japan and into the Pacific Ocean this year. While they were too high to be seen or heard on the ground, the Japanese government set off emergency sirens and warnings advising people to seek shelter. Abe has pushed for stronger U.N. sanctions on North Korea, and joined Trump in saying China should do more to pressure its neighbor. Trump and Abe are likely to agree that what is needed is more pressure, not dialogue, as they have in the past.___TRADEOne of Trump\'s first moves as president was to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that had been signed with 11 other countries after years of tough negotiations. While widely anticipated, it was a blow to Japan and the other TPP members. In line with Trump\'s preference for country-to-country trade deals, Vice President Mike Pence and Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Taro Aso have been leading an "economic dialogue" aimed at forging closer ties. Japan\'s trade surplus with the U.S. is much smaller than China\'s, and Japanese automakers, especially, have sought to mute criticism by setting up shop in the U.S. and hiring American workers. But Trump has complained about a weakening of the yen over the past five years that has aided Japanese exporters and other corporations with significant business overseas.___ABDUCTIONSTrump\'s address to the U.N. General Assembly in September, in which he warned the U.S. might have "to totally destroy North Korea," got attention in Japan for another reason. "We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea\'s spies," he said. In so doing, Trump touched on an issue that Abe has made a priority to resolve: the Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s. Five returned in 2002, but the fate of the others remains unclear. Trump plans to meet with the relatives of some of the abductees while he is in Japan.___FORE!Golf diplomacy has become part of Japan\'s playbook on Donald Trump. Abe made a stopover in New York soon after the U.S. presidential election last November and presented the then-president-elect with a pricey Japanese Honma driver. Trump reciprocated with a golf shirt and other golf-related goods. The two hit the links at Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after a summit meeting in Washington in February. They will be joined by top Japanese pro Hideki Matsuyama on Sunday at the Kasumigaseki Country Club outside of Tokyo. The prestigious club changed its policy to allow women to be full members in March after coming under pressure as the venue for golf at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2020. Japanese TV showed Abe playing golf Friday in preparation for Sunday\'s outing with Trump.', '', 'Fox411: Kathy Griffin is no stranger to being under fire for her jokes that have crossed the threshold from funny to straight up offensiveKathy Griffin can\'t stop whining.In a new YouTube video, the comedian complained about not being able to find work after she says she was blacklisted by Hollywood for posing with a severed, bloodied head of President Trump."I’m getting a lot of online hate from trolls who think I’ve lost my mind.

President Donald Trump sharply increased the amount of money he gave away through his foundation last year as the charity drew scrutiny during the campaign.A 2016 tax return posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar shows that the Donald J. Trump Foundation gave away $3.1 million, more than it did in the prior three years combined. Most of that money came from a fundraiser for veterans held by Trump early last year.Trump drew criticism during the campaign after news organizations raised questions about his foundation’s use of funds and reported that he often did not follow through on promised donations.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman launched an investigation into the foundation last year after reports that Trump used the charity to settle lawsuits, made an illegal $25,000 political contribution to a group supporting Florida’s attorney general, and purchased items such as a painting of himself that was displayed at one of his properties. A tax return made public after the election showed the foundation itself admitted to violating IRS regulations.Trump promised in December to dissolve the charity to avoid conflicts of interest, but Schneiderman has said the charity cannot close while the investigation is going on. A spokeswoman for the Trump Foundation said Monday that the charity is working with the attorney general’s office to close down and will distribute the rest of its money at the “earliest possible time.”The money raised last year went to several veterans’ groups including the Green Beret Foundation and Veterans in Command, which provides shelter for homeless veterans. The foundation also gave to Partners for Patriots, which provides service dogs for disabled veterans, and Racing for Heroes, which uses motorsports as recreational therapy for veterans.Trump has pledged to donate his annual $400,000 salary as president to charity.Major donors to the foundation include Phil Ruffin, the casino billionaire who partnered with Trump on a Las Vegas residential tower that bears the president’s name. He gave $1 million to the charity last year.Another donor is the Daryl and Steven Roth Foundation, which gave $50,000. Steven Roth is CEO of Vornado Realty Trust, which owns two office buildings with Trump.Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, donated $100,000 to the foundation.The Washington Post last year reported that records showed Trump made $8.5 million in pledges to charitable groups in the 15 years before his campaign but paid out only about $2.8 million.Aside from his foundation, Trump donated $1 million to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation, a charity run by a friend.', 'DANANG, Vietnam – Leaders of the countries participating in a Pacific Rim trade pact abandoned by President Donald Trump have agreed to meet and work out details of a deal.Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Friday that he was "reasonably confident" the 11 countries remaining in the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have a basic agreement.His comments to a business conference on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum followed conflicting reports that a basic agreement had been reached.Najib said officials met until 3 a.m. Friday trying to bridge their differences and produce a statement for the leaders of their countries to endorse.', 'Donald Trump\'s Twitter account was deactivated for 11 minutes by Twitter employee on his last day.

Companies sometimes name nominee directors to obfuscate who is really running operations. Jürgen Mossack, founder of the firm, was one of the nominee directors of Process Consultants, Bernstein reported.In 1994, Process Consultants sold the apartment for $355,000 to a woman from Hong Kong, using the Trump Corporation as its broker.While there is no indication that the sale was illegal, the quick turnaround on the condo and the secretive nature of Process Consultants spurred some concern that money laundering may have been involved, the New York Daily News reported.Trump\'s name pops up elsewhere in the Panama Papers, but Bernstein’s find marks the president\'s earliest known appearance.The 2016 leak of the Panama Papers, a trove of nearly 12 million financial documents tracing Mossack Fonseca\'s efforts to help politicians and celebrities shield their money from taxes, led to the removal of Pakistan and Iceland’s prime ministers and numerous high-level investigations around the world.Early in November, Trump\'s Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, was revealed in the so-called “Paradise Papers” to have conducted large business deals with Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s son-in-law.Gregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

The two leaders, who have struck up an unlikely but easy rapport, shared a casual lunch and played nine holes at the Kasumigaseki Country Club, joined by professional golfer Hideki Matsuyama.The low-key agenda was a prelude to the formal talks, a press conference and state dinner planned in Tokyo Monday. Abe will be looking for a united front against North Korea and reassurances that the U.S. will stand by its treaty obligations to defend Japan if attacked.Eager to forge a bond with Tokyo\'s crucial ally, Abe was one of the first world leaders to court to President-elect Trump. He was the first to call Trump after the election, and rushed to New York days later to meet the president-elect and present him with a pricey, gold Honma golf driver. The two men also met on the sidelines of an international summit in Italy this spring and White House officials said Trump has spoken with Abe by phone more than any world leader, aside from British Prime Minister Theresa May.That bond was clear on Sunday, as Trump and Abe exchanged glowing tweets about their game. Trump dubbed Abe and Matsuyama "wonderful people," while Abe called it a "round of golf with a marvelous friend."From the time Marine One landed on the Kasumigaseki Country Club\'s driving range, Abe rolled out little touches to make Trump feel welcome. He presented a hat that had a version of Trump\'s campaign theme, this time reading "Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater." The two passed up the region\'s famed Kobe beef in favor of the American version, which is favored by Trump, a famed picky eater.When Trump hosted Abe in Palm Beach earlier this year, they played at one of Trump\'s Florida golf courses. For that outing, Trump brought along pro golfer Ernie Els, so this time Abe matched him by bringing along Matsuyama, whom Trump described on the plane ride to Asia as "probably the greatest player in the history of Japan." Abe was behind the wheel of a golf cart as the two men were spotted moving from hole to hole, Trump in the passenger seat smiling and waving at those they passed."From the point of view of Abe administration, the personal chemistry that exists between the two leaders is seen as an asset," said Mireya Sollis, chair in Japan Studies for the Brookings Center for East Asia Policy Studies. She said that the Japanese believe it is already "seeing it pay off," including when Trump agreed to meet with the families of Japanese citizens kidnapped by the North Korean regime, an important issue for Tokyo.Ever since Saudi Arabia delivered a lavish welcome on Trump\'s first international trip, leaders have tried to outdo themselves to impress the president, who has proven susceptible to flattery.Before the game, Trump delivered a speech in which he hailed Japan as a "crucial ally" and warned adversaries not to test America\'s resolve."Japan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States and today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations," Trump told American service members at Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo.Though Trump did not mention North Korea by name during the speech, the spectre of its weapons program will loom large throughout Trump\'s five-nation Asia trip. The president warned of the consequences of crossing what he called the "most fearsome fighting force in the history of our world.""Together with our allies, America\'s warriors are prepared to defend our nation using the full range of our unmatched capabilities. No one — no dictator, no regime and no nation — should underestimate, ever, American resolve," he told the troops.And while there is worry in the region about Trump\'s unpredictable response to the threat posed by Kim Jong Un, Trump made clear he did not intend to tone down his bellicose rhetoric — which included dubbing Kim Jong Un as "Little Rocket Man" — even while in an Asian capital within reach of the North Korea dictator\'s missiles."There\'s been 25 years of total weakness, so we are taking a very much different approach" in dealing with the renegade regime in Pyongyang, he said, speaking to reporters on Air Force One.Trump also said it is "expected" that he\'ll meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of an upcoming summit in Vietnam.The easy rapport with Japan could be strained if Trump takes an aggressive approach on trade or the two men disagree on the need for a diplomatic approach to the threat looming in Pyongyang. During his campaign, Trump suggested Japan should acquire its own nuclear weapons to defend itself, hinted the U.S. might not come to the nation\'s defense, and accused Japan of "killing us" on trade. He has dropped that antagonist language almost entirely since the election, but tensions remain.Japan was a chief proponent of the Trans Pacific Partnership, a trade deal Trump pulled out of.Scott Seaman, a director for Asia of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultant organization, noted: "everything is fine with Trump until you tell him no. So far, Abe hasn\'t told him no."___Colvin reported from Tokyo.

We’ve seen lots of pictures of Mr. Trump playing sports. We’ve seen him on the first hole of a country club golf course, squeezed into khakis, the swing and violent follow-through, but golf, though it might not make you a bad person, won’t make you good. It depends entirely too much on honesty, thus serving as a perfect home for a certain kind of mulligan-taking con man.We’ve also seen him playing tennis, and woe, it was an unpleasant sight — the white shorts, though giant, not giant enough, underwear-line as visible as the sun’s corona at the moment of full eclipse. And tennis, with its intersecting lines and angles, its aristocratic air and money green surface, will make you a bad person.I don’t know how closely Mr. Trump even follows baseball, but if he does, he’s probably a Yankees fan — because that franchise, with its pinstripes and nonstop talk of winning, is Donald Trump all over. It’s good for fans but bad for humans, as it teaches the wrong lessons. What we want for a president is a person who grew up in the bleachers of Wrigley Field, learning humility and loss, the fleeting nature of glory.Though the Cubs have clinched the National League Central and are poised to make another playoff run, our character, that old Cubs thing, has not gone away. We are what happened to us, and what happened to us was decades of losing. The team won the World Series in 1908 and did not win it again until last fall. Generations came of age in the 107 years in between, grew up, grew old and were still waiting when they died. The dry spell was said to result from a curse placed on the team by the owner of the Billy Goat Tavern, and we did feel cursed, but blessed too.The wilderness formed our character, turned us into the sort of fans who make the best of a bad afternoon. Even now, with the championship so close behind us, I find myself wondering just how the wheels will come off this time. A Cubs fan will always be a kind of Buddhist. She knows how to enjoy a typical August afternoon, as for her there is hardly ever such a thing as October — only here and now.My father is from New York. I grew up in Chicagoland. Heading home from a Cubs game in 1976, he said: “I want you to make a promise. I want you to promise me you will never be a Cubs fan. I’m a Yankees fan,” he explained. “I expect to win. A Cubs fan expects to lose — he spends half his life looking for a reason to lose. He comes to believe that losing is the natural condition of life, that all human endeavor ends in ruin. He will have a bad existence.”My father was right, and wrong. A Cubs fan does accept and even cherish loss. He understands that winning is overrated, even unreal — that there is no need to get back to Eden because we’ve been in Eden all along. In short, just about every quality that makes Mr. Trump a nightmare in governance could be cured by a few summers at Wrigley.Hubris: This is Mr. Trump in a word. He needs to tell us that his fingers are not only normal in length but exceptional; that he is the best and strongest, a kind of sun god who, if you cross him, can rain down fire. But a Cubs fan knows all such talk is idle, because we are all cursed and history is nothing but a catalog of sure things that failed.Fixation on the short term: Mr. Trump is not a deliberate thinker. If Kim Jong-un says he’s going to shoot a missile at Guam, then doesn’t, Mr. Trump declares victory, even if, all the while, Mr. Kim is building a doomsday laser in his mountain lair. A Cubs fan takes the long view, having learned to think in hundred-year increments — the length between championships. We know time is glacial, that things are moving deep beneath the surface. As the Cubs announcer Jack Brickhouse said, “Everyone is entitled to a bad century.”No sense of history: Mr. Trump is a man who seems to believe he just might run into Frederick Douglass on the lecture circuit. A Cubs fan would never make such a mistake — he is all about history, his team being little more than stories, characters, mystical events. He can tell you about Three Finger Brown, whose right hand yielded never-to-be replicated, nearly-impossible-to-hit curve balls; about the seizures that the pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander, ruined by World War I, suffered on the mound; about the collapse of the ’69 team foreshadowed by the appearance of a black cat one night at Shea Stadium. A Cubs fan knows history is repetition and return, that those who forget it are condemned to repeat it but, even scarier, that those who remember it are also condemned to repeat it.American greatness: Mr. Trump wants to make America Great Again, but does not understand what made it great in the first place. He harkens back to an older America, when most of the leading figures were a single shade, which seems to echo the past of the game, but is a lie. A Cubs fan knows that Chicago, more than any other pro team, was responsible for establishing the color line that existed in the game from August 1883, when Cap Anson, the Cubs player-manager and their first great star, refused to let his team appear on the same field as a black player until April 1947, when Jackie Robinson made his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers. He knows that racism is the original sin of the game, and how a hateful thing can take many lifetimes to live down.Obsession with winning: It’s a big problem for Mr. Trump. The Cubs would have cured him of this affliction. That’s what 107 years in the wilderness will do. It made being a fan of this team special. Wearing a Cubs hat told the world you were holier, not obsessed with victory, having escaped the wheel of profit and loss — your kingdom was not of this world.Some say these qualities will be lost now that the Cubs are champions, swapped for more mundane excellence; that we have nothing left to teach. But that’s not true. Our character was formed a million summers ago, in the caldron of the game’s first afternoons and on the innumerable afternoons that followed. We will never forget the most important lesson: Victory is fleeting; how you play and the respect you show the other players is all that remains when the flags come down.', 'WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Sunday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was "wasting his time" trying to negotiate with North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs, raising speculation about whether Trump could be undermining efforts to maintain channels of communication or somehow bolstering the diplomat\'s hand in possible future talks.It was not immediately clear what prompted Trump\'s tweets, among a series of weekend posts that ranged from hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico to NFL players\' allegiance to the national anthem, and at whom they were aimed: Tillerson, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, those pushing for continued diplomacy, those favoring a military response to repeated provocations.Tillerson had acknowledged on Saturday, after meetings in Beijing with Chinese leaders, that the Trump administration was keeping open direct channels of communications with North Korea and probing the North\'s willingness to talk.He provided no elaboration about those channels or the substance of any discussions. After he left China, his spokeswoman issued a statement saying that North Korean officials "have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearization."And then Trump weighed in the next day with tweets that included his usual personal dig at Kim."I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man ... Save your energy Rex, we\'ll do what has to be done!"Trump offered no further explanation, but last month he told the U.N. General Assembly that if the U.S. is "forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea."Later, after Trump arrived at an international golf competition at a northern New Jersey course, a new tweet appeared: "Being nice to Rocket Man hasn\'t worked in 25 years, why would it work now? Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed. I won\'t fail."To a senior Tillerson adviser, there was no ambiguity in Trump\'s earlier posts."The President just sent a clear message to NK: show up at the diplomatic table before the invitation gets cold," R.C. Hammond tweeted. "Message to Rex? Try message to Pyongyang: Step up to the diplomatic table."U.S.-North Korean communications are long-standing. They include the two nations\' U.N. missions, regular exchanges between senior diplomats, and unofficial discussions between North Korean officials and former U.S. officials. Diplomats say there have been no new channels established recently, or any dramatic shift in Trump administration policy.Some commentators seized on Trump\'s tweets as evidence that he was either undermining Tillerson personally or his diplomacy, or both. Others said the tweets might represent a "good cop-bad cop approach" to North Korea that may or may not be misguided or bear fruit.Still others saw Trump\'s words as an attempt to give Tillerson diplomatic cover and potentially strengthen his hand in persuading North Korea to come to the table by declaring the effort a "waste of time" that the U.S. could abandon at any time in favor of tightening sanctions even further or a military response.Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the U.S. "absolutely" should step up diplomatic efforts. "We\'re moving to a place where we\'re going to end up with a binary choice soon," Corker told NBC\'s "Meet the Press" in an interview before Trump had tweeted."I think Tillerson understands that every intelligence agency we have says there\'s no amount of economic pressure you can put on North Korea to get them to stop this program because they view this as their survival," Corker said.He added: "If we don\'t ramp up the diplomatic side, it\'s possible that we end up cornered."The main goal of the initial contacts through the diplomatic back-channel between the Trump State Department and North Korea\'s mission at the United Nations was the freedom of several American citizens imprisoned in North Korea, although U.S. officials have told The Associated Press there were broader discussions about U.S.-North Korean relations.Those contacts, however, have failed to reduce the deep mistrust between the adversaries.North Korea has in recent months tested long-range missiles that potentially could reach the U.S., and on Sept. 3 conducted its largest nuclear test explosion to date. The standoff has entered a new, more dangerous phase since then as Kim and Trump have exchanged personal insults and threats of war.', '', 'Lawmakers pass a $4 trillion budget bill.Senate Republicans narrowly passed a $4 trillion budget plan Thursday, taking their first big step toward a tax reform package promised by President Donald Trump.Approval of the nonbinding plan allows the Senate to use a special process known as "budget reconciliation" that would forestall a Democratic filibuster."Tonight we completed the first step towards replacing our broken tax code by passing a comprehensive, fiscally responsible budget that will help put the federal government on a path to balance," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to replace a failing tax code that holds Americans back with one that works for them."The Senate plan, approved on a 51-49 vote, calls for $473 billion in cuts from Medicare over 10 years and more than $1 trillion from Medicaid.If fully implemented, the plan would cut spending by more than $5 trillion over the next 10 years, with an average of approximately $540 billion per year over the life of the plan, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the only Republican to vote against the bill, joining all 46 Democrats and two independents."We can’t spend our way to prosperity," Paul said in a statement. "I will fight for the biggest, boldest tax cut we can pass, but I could not in good conscience vote for a budget that ignores spending caps that have been the law of the land for years and simply pretend it didn’t matter."Sen.

Both plans include a provision to permit oil and gas exploration in Alaska\'s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., blasted the GOP framework as "nasty and backwards.""It shifts the burden from the wealthy and puts it squarely on the back of the middle class, and blows a hole in the deficit to boot," Schumer said in a statement.

Despite having the full support of their friends in the media, they have consistently failed to find anything substantive.At first, I assumed the liberal elites were simply driven by their inability to accept that the American people elected Donald Trump as their 45th president. Now, I have another theory: The Trump-Russia story is meant to serve as a pure distraction aimed at masking real corruption by the Clinton political machine.As The Hill reported on Sunday, while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, a Kremlin-linked bank paid her husband, former President Bill Clinton, hundreds of thousands of dollars. Also during her tenure as top diplomat, earlier reports indicate Canadian and Russian business executives directed many millions more to the Clinton Foundation. In fact, citing recently unsealed Federal Bureau of Investigation reports, The Hill described a thorough Russian campaign aimed at gaining access to the Clintons and capitalizing on their influence, while also spying on them to advance a pro-Russia agenda. In 2010, the FBI arrested 10 so-called “sleeper cell” Russian spies who had reportedly become too close to Hillary Clinton.Meanwhile, while serving as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was also overseeing a laundry list of U.S.-Russian initiatives and dealings.Among other things, she served on the Committee on Foreign Investment, where she voted in favor of President Obama’s approval of the sale of Uranium One, a Canadian business, to a state-owned Russian nuclear energy outfit. At the time, the Canadian company controlled 20 percent of the U.S. uranium reserves.Before the sale was approved, a Kremlin-linked bank that supported the deal paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a 90-minute speech in Moscow to promote the Uranium One’s stock. Bill then met personally with Vladimir Putin. All the while, people linked with Uranium One – and its previous incarnation UrAsia – reportedly paid the Clinton Foundation $145 million in donations.You can’t make this stuff up, and while the news media continues to acknowledge the facts, they still claim there is no foul play on behalf of the Clintons in terms of the uranium deal. The Media Research Center found that the ABC, NBC, and CBS evening shows have “spent only 3 minutes and 1 second on the Clinton Foundation scandal in more than two years.”In comparison, another Media Research Center report found that since Inauguration Day evening shows on these three networks have aired “1,000 minutes of coverage discussing Russia’s attempt to boost Trump in 2016, and speculation that Trump’s campaign may have colluded with the Russians in this project.”And remember: The so-called collusion story came out of supposed opposition research we now know was funded by Clinton and her Democrat allies.Thankfully, House and Senate Republicans have now launched new investigations into the Clintons’ ties to Russia – as well as Hillary’s illegal use of a private email server as Secretary of State. The email scandal is now even more significant given that we know that she continued to use a private, insecure email server despite the FBI arresting a ring of Russian agents who were specifically targeting her.As I told Sean Hannity on Monday, I think we are on the edge of the greatest corruption scandal in American history.The first thing Congress should do is demand that every single dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation and its charity initiatives be made public to show exactly where the Clintons derived their money. I suspect there are millions of foreign dollars hidden away in foreign subsidiaries that were never reported in financial disclosures.The truth about the level of foreign donation, influence peddling, and outright corruption involved in the Clinton world could change American politics forever.The great irony of all this though, is that the Clintons started the so-called Russian collusion scandal, and in the end, they may be the ones destroyed by it.Newt Gingrich is a Fox News contributor.

He plans to speak at a rally for Mr. Moore that will also include Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief strategist to Mr. Trump.“I’m honored to have the endorsement of Brexit leader @Nigel_Farage, who’ll join us in Fairhope on Monday,” Mr. Moore said on Twitter.Mr. Farage, the former U.K. Independence Party leader who helped lead the “Brexit” movement, campaigned for Mr. Trump in the presidential election and was the first foreign politician to meet with him after he won. As president-elect, Mr. Trump suggested that Britain appoint Mr. Farage as its ambassador to the United States, an idea that was quickly dismissed by the British government.The Alabama race to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions pits Mr. Moore, an evangelical favorite, against Luther Strange, who has the support of Mr. Trump and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. Mr. Strange was appointed to the Senate this year after Mr. Sessions left.The runoff has put the candidates’ supporters into the tricky position of trying not to offend the other side. Mr. Trump has said he would campaign for Mr. Moore in the general election if he wins. And Breitbart News, the far-right website led by Mr. Bannon, cast Mr. Farage’s visit to Alabama on Monday as an effort to deliver a setback to Mr. McConnell, not the president.Mr. Trump has wagered his political capital on Mr. Strange, traveling to Alabama on  Friday to campaign with him and speak at a rally. Establishment Republicans have told Mr. Trump that Mr. Strange would be a more dependable vote in the Senate than Mr. Moore.Even with the president’s support, Mr. Strange trails by single digits, and a loss will raise questions about the reach of Mr. Trump’s influence among the Republican Party’s conservative base.If Mr. Strange succeeds, he will have to defeat a faction of anti-Washington forces aligning with Mr. Moore. In addition to support from Mr. Bannon, Mr. Moore has received endorsements from Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor, and Phil Robertson, the star of the reality show “Duck Dynasty.”Democrats in Alabama are rooting for Mr. Moore, believing that his views on homosexuality and social issues would make him more vulnerable than Mr. Strange in the general election.', 'SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico – Outside of official events, many Puerto Ricans say they won\'t be welcoming President Donald Trump with open arms during his visit to the storm-wracked island Tuesday.People in the U.S. territory were angry or dismissive Monday when asked about Trump\'s description of some Puerto Ricans who have criticized the U.S. government\'s aid after Hurricane Maria as "ingrates" and about his assurances that the relief effort is going well."He\'s a piece of trash," Rachel Cruz, a linguist, said as she head home after buying groceries in the capital, San Juan. "He makes a fool out of himself and a fool out of his country."Cruz said Puerto Ricans are furious with power still cut off on most of the island, schools and many businesses closed, and much of the countryside struggling to find fresh water and food, but she said even the angriest were unlikely to openly insult the man ultimately responsible for helping them."The majority of people here feel that way, but we have to be more balanced because we need help," she said.Even those happy with the federal aid effort for the U.S. territory\'s 3.4 million people said they resented Trump\'s tweets about some Puerto Ricans being lazy and ungrateful."We appreciate all the help that we\'ve received, but his comments are not true," said Nancy Rivera, a private school principal who was out buying bread. "We don\'t deserve that."Rivera and her husband live in the north coastal town of Toa Baja, which was one of the hardest hit by Maria and where dozens of people had to be rescued from rooftops amid widespread flooding. The couple has moved temporarily to their son\'s apartment in San Juan.Angel Tomas Crispin, manager of a convenience store that was doing brisk business as people sought to restock basic supplies, didn\'t have kind words for the president. "Donald Trump is not the solution for Puerto Rico," he said.Crispin said he was angered by Trump\'s recent comments about the island. "All this money he has, and all the education he has, and he\'s ignorant."Noelys Martinez, a call center worker, said she didn\'t think Trump\'s visit would change anything."The lights are not going to come back on because of him," she said as she strolled near a park eating ice cream.Luis Torres, a retiree taking an evening walk with his wife, Marina, said Trump isn\'t welcome."As far as I\'m concerned, he shouldn\'t come," Torres said.His wife nodded aggressively."He has expressed himself in such a disrespectful way. Extremely unnecessary and extremely insensitive," she said. "It\'s very sad."', 'Tax, Lies and Videotape - The New York TimesThis article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox.The standard by which the Trump tax plan should be judged is the standard that the Trump administration itself has set.“There will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said shortly after the election. “My plan is for the working people,” President Trump said yesterday. “I don’t benefit.”None of that is true. It’s the latest disturbing example of politicians telling falsehoods about a proposed policy. Trump has done so repeatedly, and now members of Congress are doing it more often, too. These aren’t mere exaggerations or truth shadings; they are often just lies.“Trump’s tax plan: prioritize cuts for the rich, say he isn’t,” as New York Magazine succinctly puts it.You can read The Times Editorial Board’s analysis — that the plan relies on the discredited notion that tax cuts for the rich help everyone — here.Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center, probably the single best source for tax analysis, writes that the plan “may cut taxes modestly for some middle-income households, but it appears to be a far bigger tax cut for high-income households.”Wealthy households, Gleckman explains, would benefit from individual rate cuts, repeal of both the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax, as well as tax cuts for corporations and “pass-through” businesses (such as sole proprietorships and partnerships).In Fortune, Seth Hanlon points out that this last provision would shower huge benefits on Trump’s family.And the tax cuts for the affluent are so large — trillions of dollars over the coming decade, says Lily Batchelder of N.Y.U. — that they would cause the deficit to soar.James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute writes that “their plan should be a non-starter.” He adds, “It also makes a joke of the GOP’s supposed deficit worries during the Obama years.”As those comments suggest, the plan didn’t even win good marks from many conservatives. National Review’s Ramesh Ponnuru had one of the less harsh takes and argued that the plan would be much better with a large child tax credit.The search now begins for three Republican senators — enough to stop this plan — who are willing to take a stand for the deficit and the middle class.You can watch a video of Trump’s tax speech here.Dr. Enrichment.

Among people who work in politics, Republicans as well as Democrats, it is conventional wisdom that President Trump is staggeringly ill-informed, erratic, reckless and dishonest. (He also might be compromised by a hostile foreign power.) But it’s also conventional wisdom that with few exceptions, Republicans in Congress are not going to stand up to him. America’s nuclear arsenal is in the hands of a senescent Twitter troll, but those with political power have refused to treat this fact as a national emergency. Thus, even though a majority of Americans consider the president unfit for office, a fatalistic sense of stasis has set in.Credit Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, for momentarily snapping us out of it. On Sunday evening, after a Twitter feud with Trump, Corker gave an interview to The New York Times in which he said publicly what Republican officeholders usually say only privately. Trump, Corker told the reporters Jonathan Martin and Mark Landler, is treating the presidency like “a reality show” and could be setting the nation “on the path to World War III.” Corker has previously said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Chief of Staff John Kelly “help separate our country from chaos.” On Sunday, he identified the agent of that chaos. “I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it’s a situation of trying to contain him,” Corker said of Trump.Now that Corker has done the country the immense favor of acknowledging the obvious, the key question is: What’s next? Corker, despite his culpability in helping to legitimize Trump during the presidential campaign and despite waiting until he’d announced his retirement to speak out, has behaved more patriotically than most of his quietly complicit colleagues. But as Trump continues to tweet threats at a war-ready North Korea, it is not enough to simply hope that the president’s minders can stop him from blowing up the world.Corker, after all, is not a passive spectator; he’s the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “The Congress holds the ultimate power for war,” Jerry Taylor, president of the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank, told me. “Though they have more or less delegated that power away to the executive branch, they can take it back.”They could start with a pair of bills introduced by Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey and California Representative Ted Lieu, both Democrats, prohibiting the president from launching a nuclear first strike without a congressional declaration of war. So far, the only Republican to sign on in either chamber is Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina. But given how little faith Senate Republicans have in Trump’s judgment, they have a duty to take up this legislation or develop an alternative. “Increasingly, senators and members of Congress are going to come to the conclusion that there has to be a firewall that is erected so that a single human being cannot impulsively launch nuclear weapons,” Markey told me.Despite its overall record of weakness, Congress has already acted on one occasion to curb Trump’s worst foreign policy impulses. In July, Republicans voted overwhelmingly for a bipartisan bill that, among other things, limited Trump’s ability to unilaterally lift sanctions on Russia. Tying Trump’s hands on nuclear weapons would be a far more aggressive step, but it’s one that members of Congress who are mindful of this moment’s profound peril should take.Of course, “should” is the key word here. There are plenty of things that Republicans should do about Trump, including impeaching him for violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution. We’ve grown so inured to Republican politicians’ persistent refusal to put the welfare of the country above their re-election prospects and lust for tax cuts that complaining about it feels banal and naïve.But Corker’s expression of alarm is a reminder that we are teetering on the cusp of horror. He made it clear that Trump’s tweeted provocations of North Korea are impulsive rather than strategic. “A lot of people think that there is some kind of ‘good cop, bad cop’ act underway, but that’s just not true,” he said. We need to take seriously the possibility that Trump might cavalierly start a war that could kill millions of people. It would be a human calamity of inconceivable, history-bending scale, and it would leave America as a hated global pariah. Now that Corker has admitted that Trump cannot be trusted with the power he holds, he and other Republicans have no excuse not to try to take that power away.Taylor, of the Niskanen Center, is in frequent contact with anti-Trump Republicans, and he senses a growing sense of urgency among them. “Having an unstable narcissist who is ignorant of politics, policy and foreign affairs with the nuclear codes has probably turned them white as a sheet,” he said. “There is some degree of serious responsibility that they fully realize that they hold.” If so, now would be a good time to show it.', 'Trevor Noah Can’t Believe Republicans Still Let Trump Speak - The New York TimesWelcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy.

Al Green\'s resolution is killedThe House of Representatives overwhelmingly rejected an attempt to impeach President Trump after a liberal Texas congressman forced a vote on his effort.Democratic Rep. Al Green, who has repeatedly called for the president\'s removal, introduced two articles of impeachment against Trump on Wednesday.But lawmakers immediately voted to effectively kill his resolution, with 364 voting to table it and 58 Democrats voting to move ahead.In a dramatic speech on the floor ahead of the vote, Green called Trump “unfit” for office and accused him of "high misdemeanors."The symbolic vote had been expected to fail in the Republican-controlled House. It put some lawmakers in competitive districts in a tough spot by forcing them on the record about impeachment.Lawmakers did not actually vote on the actual articles of impeachment, but on a procedural measure that would have led to a vote on them.“As I have said before, this is not about Democrats, it is about democracy,” Green wrote in a memo to his colleagues. “It is not about Republicans, it is about the fate of our Republic. May everyone vote their conscience knowing that history will judge us all.”Green has discussed his intention to impeach Trump since last spring. In October, Green filed impeachment articles that nearly forced a vote -- until House Democratic leaders persuaded him to abandon the effort.At the time, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called the effort "pathetic.”AL GREEN INTRODUCES ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST TRUMPIn his memo to lawmakers, Green didn’t allege “obstruction of justice” or reference the ongoing investigation into the 2016 presidential campaign’s connection with Russia.Instead, Green highlighted Trump’s supposed association with “White Nationalism, Neo-Nazism and Hate,” as well as “Inciting Hatred and Hostility,” as offenses worthy of impeachment.“Friends, whether we like it or not, we now have a bigot in the White House who incites hatred and hostility,” Green wrote in a letter.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has insisted that any impeachment effort should be put on hold until there is evidence of an impeachable offense.Fox News’ Mike Emanuel and Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Alex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

A transcription with a WER of 4.8, for example, is 4.8 percent inaccurate or 95.2 percent correct.Who scored the highest?Nikki Haley came in first, according to Trint, with an accuracy rating of 99.48 percent.Former Secretary Clinton was second, with rating of 99.38 percent, while Louis-Dreyfus "Veep" character, Meyer, came in fourth, scording 98.74 percent.“It’s worth noting that Julia Louis-Dreyfuss is a seasoned actress so it’s not surprising that her speech is clear and clean,” Trint added.FAKE NEWS IS HERE TO STAY, STUDY SAYSWho scored the lowest?Trint said the lowest-scoring politicians had some common speech patterns.Both House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Trump have a tendency to swallow parts of a word when they speak, Kofman told Fox News.In some cases, heavy accents hurt the results. Thanks to Cruz\'s Texas drawl, he ranked 13th place.President Trump ranked 11th at 97.89 percent. “Due to slow and measured way of speaking, President Trump has a far lower total word count than usual for a politician; 380 for this sample, where the average across all speakers is 486,” Kofman said.“Additionally, he has a tendency to swallow some of the prefixes and suffixes of his words; for example, the word ‘incredible’ in the phrase ‘That\'s something. And I\'m honored by your incredible support and grateful for your commitment to our shared cause’ was rendered as ‘credible,\'" Kofman went on to say.Pelosi came in last among the 15 politicians, with a 96.01 percent accuracy, according to Trint\'s findings.Kofman added that the accuracy can also be affected simply by recording quality – which has nothing to do with person’s speech patterns. For example, some errors occurred because the Trint system missed words that were spoken away from the microphone.“Even though Trump and Pelosi ranked lower than others they still come out really well in these samples for the Trint Index,"Kofman said. "Human transcription doesn\'t do much better than that and takes a lot longer and costs multiples more."', 'Moore, Trump and the Right’s New Religion - The New York TimesI have lived my whole life with a Republican Party with which I disagreed, but at least understood.The first election I can remember was the presidential election of 1980. I was 10 years old. I didn’t know much about politics or party platforms. I only knew that the former peanut-farmer president, Jimmy Carter, was running against a former actor, Ronald Reagan.But it was in that election that Jerry Falwell and his Moral Majority reintroduced religious activism into American politics. Speaking at a Dallas convention of Christian fundamentalists, Falwell proclaimed: “During the 1980s, preachers, we have a threefold primary responsibility. No. 1: Get people saved. No. 2: Get them baptized. No. 3: Get them registered to vote.”The religious activism was in many ways a direct response to the strides made in the 1960s and 1970s on racial equality, women’s rights and gay rights.In a way, their driving motivation was to make religious law into American law, really not so unlike the Shariah law they so fear and despise.My brothers and I stayed up late with my mother to watch the returns on election night in 1980. When it was clear that the actor had beaten the farmer, my mother quietly left the room, and an air of solemnity and sadness filled it.For the three decades that followed, I could count on one thing: the conservative right was the religious right. That was its branding, if not always its behavior. It was as if the foot soldiers for the conservative right had read only half of the Bible they thumped. They were harsh and vindictive like the God of the Old Testament, not generous and inclusive like the Jesus of the New Testament.Then there were the hypocrites, condemning sexual liberation while being secretly lascivious, their railing against gays later exposed as a form of gay panic.But now, all the pretense of any “moral” majority and “moral” authority has vanished into the very impulses that fed it: Tribal racial/ethnic anxiety, panic and hostility, patriarchy and sexism, and a perceived threat presented by the full acceptance and inclusion of L.G.B.T. identities.Piety is now postscript. The principal motivation now is anger, fear of cultural displacement, and anxiety about the erosion of privilege and the guarantees it once provided, from physical safety to financial security.You can peg any number of moments in recent history when the objective seemed to change for the members of the religious right, where they swallowed all pride and principle to secure power and vent anger, but for me there is none more glaring than the embrace of Donald Trump.Trump is clearly not a religious man, unless you believe being compulsively devilish is a form of religiosity. He is mean and surly. He is a bully. He is a pathological liar. He cheats. He is an adulterer. He is twice-divorced with children by three different women. He bragged, on tape, about assaulting women. He says he doesn’t think he has ever asked God for forgiveness.Trump was a walking, talking rebuke of everything the Christian right had ever told me that it stood for, and yet Republican voters either held their noses or thrust their fists in the air and voted for him anyway.The anger that gave birth to Trump was a death notice for Republican religious principles. Now, if you ask me what the Republican Party stands for, I’m not sure I can tell you. All I see is regression, wealth worship, nationalism and white supremacy. Maybe that’s it. I no longer see Christ in that equation.In the wake of all that, we now have the former Alabama Supreme Court judge Roy Moore running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican. Moore has been accused by multiple women in Alabama of having inappropriate sexual contact with them when they were still minors and he was in his 30s, working as a district attorney.The accusations are serious and not easily dismissed. And yet Moore has denied them, vociferously and unequivocally. Someone here is telling a vicious lie. It’s a he said/she, she, she, she, she said. Not to mention the people interviewed by The New Yorker who say that Moore was banned from a local mall for harassing girls.What has been most distressing and revelatory is the contortions Moore’s supporters have put themselves in to try to defend him against the allegations.It would be one thing it they were simply saying that they didn’t believe the allegations, but they’re not. They’re also giving “Even if it did happen …” rationales that suggest that pedophilia is acceptable if you are willing and able to advance a certain cultural agenda. It should be noted that the possibility of pedophilia is a common mythology that religious conservatives use as a cudgel against gay people, to justify wanting to deny them equal rights.Not only has Moore’s alleged sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl been illogically likened to the relationship between Joseph and Mary of the Bible, a puke-worthy comparison, but the corrosion of principle and the moral deprivation of the modern right might best be summed up by a tweet written by David Horowitz, author of “The Politics of Bad Faith.” Horowitz wrote:“In my view Moore is guilty as accused. But 1) it happened 30 years ago, & 2) he can’t be removed from the ballot, & 3) electing a Dem strengthens a party that defends these criminals: Obama, the Clintons, Holder, Lynch, Abedin, Cheryl Mills, etc., & their crimes are far, far worse.”If Moore is “guilty as accused,” these people prefer a devil to a Democrat. That’s not about religious rigor, that’s ideological extremism on a Middle Eastern scale. That is a country-ruining worldview. There remains a possibility that Moore, like Trump, could win in spite of the controversy.The “religious right” as an idea is dead. There are religious people, and many are on the right, but the idea of religiosity as an organizing principle for conservatives has passed. Trump helped kill it. This incarnation of conservatism has burned its cross and erected the golden calf of Trumpism in its place.Trump is the right’s new religion.', 'President Trump touts tax reform to tuckers in Pennsylvania.

They want to raise your taxes very, very substantially. I mean, I won\'t even talk about open borders and higher taxes. That\'s not a good combination to get elected. Believe me.”He issued a warning to lawmakers who might oppose his tax reform package.TRUMP: TAX CUTS WILL BE \'ROCKET FUEL\' FOR ECONOMY“I wouldn\'t want to be apolitician against that,” he said. “They are going to have a long,hard winter.”Addressing truckers, Trump spoke in front of an 18-wheeler plastered with text that read “WIN AGAIN” and “Lower taxes. Bigger paychecks. More jobs.”Despite his criticism of Democrats, the president expressed optimism a tax reform bill could get passed.President Donald Trump speaks about tax reform during an event at the Harrisburg International Airport, Wednesday Oct. 11, 2017, in Middletown, Pa. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)“We are going to fight and we are going to get those Republicans and maybe a few of those Democrats to raise their hand, and you\'re going to have so much money to spend in this wonderful country,” he said. “And this great economy. That\'s why we have proposed tax cuts that are pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family and pro-America.”Democrats, like Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, slammed Trump’s proposal ahead of the speech on Wednesday.“Instead of focusing on policies that raise wages and create good-paying jobs for families, President Trump is coming to Pennsylvania to promote a tax plan that raises taxes on the middle class and cuts $1.5 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid to fund tax giveaways for the wealthiest,” Casey said."They don\'t want to do anything productive. They want to raise your taxes very, very substantially"The president has been traveling the country to promote a plan that would dramatically cut corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 20 percent, reduce the number of personal income tax brackets and boost the standard deduction.“We will cut taxes for everyday, hardworking Americans,” Trump said Wednesday.Speaking to the truckers, the president said, “Nothing gets done in America without the hardworking men and women of the trucking industry... When your trucks are moving, America is growing. Do you agree?”He also talked up his infrastructure proposals that have yet to pass in Congress.“My administration is also committed to passing a historic infrastructure package that will generate $1 trillion to rebuild America\'s crumbling infrastructure with a special focus on roadways and highways,” he said. “It is time to take care of our country, to rebuild our communities, and to protect our great American workers. It\'s about time.”Trump is diving back into the tax fight after weeks in which his attention has shifted to rapidly emerging crises — including the mass shooting in Las Vegas and the hurricane recovery effort in Puerto Rico — as well as dramas of his own making, such as his escalating feud with Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and public tension with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.President Donald Trump speaks about tax reform during an event at the Harrisburg International Airport, Wednesday Oct. 11, 2017, in Middletown, Pa. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)Taxes are seen as the chief priority for Republicans hungry for a major legislative achievement. With the 2018 campaign year looming, GOP lawmakers want something to show for their time as the majority party, and tax legislation remains their best hope.Trump has left it up to Congress to fill in many specifics of his plan, which omits details such as the income levels for his new tax brackets.Republicans in Congress aren\'t solidly behind him, with some from high-tax states balking because the framework calls for eliminating the federal deduction for state and local taxes. That deduction is claimed by an estimated 44 million people and costs the government an estimated $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over 10 years.Fractious Republican lawmakers, especially those from New York, New Jersey and California, are wary of the potential financial hit to their constituents. They contend repealing the deduction would subject people to being taxed twice.Fox News’ Kristin Brown and The Associated Press contributed to this report.', '', "President Donald Trump on the opioid epidemic, the border wall and the Russian dossier.President Donald Trump has criticized Russia for hindering U.S. efforts to force North Korea into getting rid of nuclear weapons -- and praised China for its support.Trump told Fox Business’ Lou Dobbs on Wednesday that Russia has been thwarting U.S. efforts to solve the North Korean nuclear issue, which threatens the U.S. and its Asia-Pacific allies.“China is helping us and maybe Russia’s going through the other way and hurting what we’re getting,” the president said about the crisis in the Korean Peninsula, adding that a better relationship with Russia might help to contain the threat.“I think we could have a good relationship” with Russia, he said. “I think that North Korean situation would be easier settled.”Trump reportedly urged Chinese officials to help address the threat posed by the North Korean nuclear program, Reuters reported, because the Asian giant is the only known major ally of Kim Jong Un's communist regime.Trump tweeted Wednesday that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping, discussing issues related to North Korea and trade.Spoke to President Xi of China to congratulate him on his extraordinary elevation.

The New York Times was provided a draft advance copy.1. International Order — the new German-American conflict of interestsOne of the new German government’s premier challenges will be to manage the trans-Atlantic relationship during Donald Trump’s presidency. Its success in this endeavor will be one way to measure its overall performance. We, a group of foreign policy experts from civil society, would like to offer some ideas.The liberal world order with its foundation in multilateralism, its global norms and values, its open societies and markets — is in danger. It is exactly this order on which Germany’s freedom and prosperity depends. The order is being challenged from various directions and sources: rising powers strive for influence; illiberal governments and authoritarian regimes are ascending; anti-modern thinking is gaining traction and influence even within Western democracies; Russia is challenging the peaceful European order; and new technologies are disrupting old economic structures.Lastly, the United States, inventor and — until recently — guardian of the liberal order, currently does not see itself as system guarantor. Donald Trump is the first U.S. president since World War II to fundamentally question the ideas and institutions of the liberal international order. He opposes this order by advocating a system of raw power and national interest. In his alternative system, small and medium sized countries play a role as dependent and secondary actors. Donald Trump is skeptical of any and all of the United States’ commitments to multilateral institutions and norms.With its preference for stable treaty-based alliances and long term, multilateral commitments, Germany sees the current international order as a cornerstone of its foreign policy. For Germany, Donald Trump’s foreign policy creates a previously unknown conflict of interest with its most important ally.Since Germany’s as well as Europe’s security and affluence rest upon the current international order even as President Trump charts a different course for the United States, an increased responsibility falls to the European Union and its member state Germany to safeguard and strengthen the international order.2. A president sui generisIt is impossible to ignore that President Trump was able to attract the support of 60 million voters. It is also true that unilateral foreign policy, protectionist moods, and periodic calls for “America First” policies have a long tradition in the United States. Still, Donald Trump is a president sui generis whose ideas about international order do not fit within the modern American politician tradition. These ideas are supported by few in the United States. His disdain for international alliances and institutions is not even shared by many in the government he leads, much less by those outside of government. Donald Trump’s positions on global order are outside the mainstream of the foreign policy expert community in the United States. It is unclear, maybe even unlikely, that his strategy of undermining the international order will ever succeed in the United States and become his country’s policy.3. Dangerous consequencesSome analysts and political actors in Germany would like to draw far-reaching conclusions from this period of uncertainty about the direction of the United States. They endorse a strategic reorientation for Germany. Some strive to decouple Europe’s foreign and security policy from the United States. Others place their faith in a German-French mini version of Europe. Sometimes, European aspirations only disguise German nationalism as a response to American nationalism. Some recommend that Germany should focus on ad hoc coalitions or maintain equidistance between Russia and the United States. Some even recommend that Germany should go further, and align itself with Russia or China in the future.All of these propositions are costly or dangerous — or both.4. The United States remains indispensableTurning away from the United States would bring insecurity to Germany and ultimately to Europe.The bond with the United States was born from dependence, but it has long been in Germany’s core national interest. Today, no other actor in the world can offer the same advantages to Germany that it gains from its alliance with the United States. No other power takes on such far-reaching security guarantees and offers such comprehensive political resources.As a liberal hegemon, the United States made European integration possible. The majority of the political establishment in the United States continues to see the country as a supporter of European integration – also because it suits its own interest. The country needs allies that share its values and interests.If Germany wants to be an effective actor in Europe, it needs the United States. If the ties to the United States are cut, with them go the reassurance that other European countries need in order to accept a strong Germany in the center of the continent. The more leadership that Germany can and should take on, the closer the coordination must be with the United States.Decoupling from the United States would fundamentally question one of the most important political and cultural achievements of the past 70 years: Germany’s integration in the West.In aligning itself with the West Germany also committed itself to the values of freedom and democracy, and to cooperation with all those who stand for these values. Freedom is the precondition for human beings to lead a self-determined and dignified live. Germany has committed itself to this set of ideas in its constitution, the Basic Law. Its anchoring in the West gave Germany the steadfastness to resist the Communist regimes and make possible Germany and European reunification. A departure from this trans-Atlantic orientation will renew the threat of a special path (Sonderweg) of Germany, it will strengthen nationalists on the left and the right, and it will endanger the peaceful European order.The West, even today, does not exist without the United States, neither as a concept, nor as a political subject America is the anchor of liberal universalism and the open world order. Even if Donald Trump’s presidency carries significant risks for the liberal order, these perils will not diminish if Germany puts its strategic partnership with the United States at stake. A strategic decoupling from the United States would ultimately endanger the liberal international order more than prudent cooperation with a United States whose leadership currently rattles this order. Autocracies such as China and Russia can be important ad hoc partners for single projects; the United States, however, must remain the strategic partner for a democratic and European Germany.The relationship with the United States is a values-based partnership built on our democratic political systems. Even if the current U.S. president challenges significant elements of the political system, the United States remains a democracy. President Trump is not America, nor is the illiberal movement for which he stands a solely American phenomenon. In Europe too it has made its mark. What we see today is not a divergence between Europe and the United States; it is a conflict within the West unfolding on both sides of the Atlantic.Finally, the economic, scientific, and cultural linkages with the United States are far stronger than with any other region in the world. The interplay with the United States remains a central element of Europe’s capacity for innovation.5. Yet, no business as usual So, how do we engage with the United States in times of Donald Trump?Even if turning away from the United States is not a responsible option for Germany, business as usual is not an option with the current presidency either. It would be equally unhelpful to stay silent and look the other way, waiting until this presidency is finally over and a successor occupies the White House. Four or even eight years is too long to sit it out, especially since there will not be a return to the supposed good old times.6. Ideas for a new U.S. StrategyGerman policy now requires something that it did not need before: a U.S. strategy.A responsible policy toward the United States must be long-term and build a bridge into the post-Trump age. This policy must look beyond an exceptional period of U.S. skepticism toward any multilateral commitment. However, Germany must not fall prey to the illusion that there will be a return to the status quo ante following the Trump Presidency. Several political trends in the United States will outlive Trump’s time in office — for example, the demand for more balanced burden-sharing between Europe and the United States within NATO. However, the end of the Trump presidency should be the end of the inner Western conflict about the fundamentals of the world order. Once this fundamental consensus is reestablished policy disagreements can be resolved or bridged more easily and more constructively.This long-term goal must be the point of reference for Germany’s short-term engagement with the Trump administration.In the short term, Germany must learn to distinguish between the problems that are solvable, those that are unsolvable, and those in between that require pragmatic management.It goes without saying that the German government should double down on those policy areas where it finds common ground with the current U.S. administration. But successful relationship management in times of Donald Trump may also require to adjust an increasingly untenable position or — vice versa — to enter into a limited conflict. Finally, we will need to look for partners not only at the highest federal levels, but elsewhere in the administration, in the U.S. Congress, in the states, in civil society, and in business.It will be more important than ever to manage differences responsibly. In its own long-term interest, Germany should attempt to handle these differences with the Trump administration in such a way that does not escalate them or allow them to spiral out of control.Germany should not succumb to illusions: large scale joint projects with the Trump government will have little chance for success in policy areas that are central to President Trump’s populist agenda. Trying to do too much in these key policy areas will only cause new disagreements.In short, Germany’s U.S. strategy must allow for multitasking: to actively pursue key national interests in collaboration with the United States, to moderate conflicts, to avoid unrealistic ambitions, and to thus build a bridge to a better future for trans-Atlantic relations.This nuanced approach will have different consequences for the different policy areas.7. Trade policy — aim only for conflict managementSoberingly, the signs are not favorable for larger projects in several policy areas that would actually be vital, such as trade policy. Despite all controversies, the strategic and economic reasons for a trans-Atlantic free trade agreement (TTIP) have not disappeared since November 2016. Some in Berlin and Brussels hope that one can resurrect TTIP in an adapted version. This idea is illusory, maybe even dangerous. A president who castigates all free trade agreements as unfair toward the United States will not easily compromise in international negotiations. A negotiating failure will be more devastating to the project than a long hibernation.There are signs already that the United States and the European Union might be headed toward trade disputes. The European Union must react to punitive tariffs. But it should do so exclusively in a legal, proportional, and symmetrical manner. Everything else could trigger an unwanted escalation.8. International refugee policy — no chance for a joint visionJoint initiatives regarding international refugee policy do not look very promising either. The global system of protection, however, urgently needs to be reformed to cope with modern conditions. The rights of refugees need to be protected while illegal migration needs to be curtailed, organized trafficking should be combated so that the universal refugee regime is not undermined. Equally important will be a push toward new and improved United Nations’ resettlement programs. However, it appears difficult to imagine that the Trump administration will agree to such initiatives. Consequently, Europe must become active itself here — as best as it can.Therefore, trade and refugee policies fall in the category of currently difficult, hardly resolvable issues. The best we can expect is limited progress, but no large scale initiatives.9. Security policy — strive for progress, also with President TrumpSecurity policy is a different matter. Without the United States there will be no security for and in Germany for the foreseeable future. This applies to territorial as well as alliance defense within NATO, but also to nuclear deterrence, to combating cyber crimes and money laundering, and finally to counterterrorism and the cooperation of intelligence agencies. No single European country, not Germany, not any other country, and not the European Union, can provide the necessary resources to guarantee the continent’s security. Therefore, the existing cooperation must be strengthened. Remaining committed to NATO also provides a way to integrate the United States into the structures of multilateral security policy and may dissuade Washington from going it alone.Alliance defense is the most cost-effective form of defense. Germany should thus take seriously the call for fairer burden-sharing within the alliance. Acting against its own core interest, Germany has not done enough in this respect. Germany still has a long way to go until it’s NATO goals and commitments are met. To be clear: Germany agreed to increase its defense expenditures toward 2 percent of its GDP. Germany should keep its word. To present this commitment as a threat to the military balance in European is to get it backwards. It is precisely our European neighbors and partners that are asking for more German commitment within the NATO framework and within European defense policy.It would be even better if Germany were to invest an extra percentage point of GDP into development assistance, international police operations, UN missions, conflict prevention, and diplomacy. With this linkage, nonmilitary aspects of security would also be upgraded. This would substantially strengthen European defense capabilities within the trans-Atlantic alliance. Germany would do something that is in its own interest and would stabilize the trans-Atlantic alliance at the same time. It would address concerns of the Trump administration and build good will for the time after Donald Trump. The chances of success for this strategy are high: Despite all of the skeptical rhetoric about NATO, the Trump administration has fulfilled America’s NATO commitments so far.Security policy cooperation with the Trump government should be central to Germany and should also include security guarantees for the central and eastern European NATO members, support for an independent Ukraine, as well as the stabilization of the North African coast.In the conflict over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and the uncertainties around future Iran policy, a trans-Atlantic schism should be avoided. We should do whatever possible to convince the Trump administration of joint approaches.10. Energy security policy — giving up Nord Stream 2 is in Germany’s interestThere is one more policy area in which the German government should reconsider its position to open the door for productive cooperation: energy security policy. The United States has identified Nord Stream 2, the planned pipeline running through the Baltic Sea to Russia, as a geostrategic project. They are correct. More important: This pipeline project is not in the joint European interest. Nord Stream 2 contradicts a policy of greater energy independence and undermines the envisaged European Energy Union. We should try to identify a joint approach with our European partners and the United States.11. Climate, energy and digital policy — manage conflicts responsiblyAfter having addressed the solvable issues and set aside the unsolvable issues for now, one will need to turn to those policy areas that require responsible conflict management. It would be useless to try to convince the U.S. administration of the importance of the Paris Climate Agreement, but it is equally wrongheaded to isolate President Trump on international climate and energy policy. Necessary criticism should not turn into dogmatism.Instead, Germany should seek concrete steps forward in climate protection together with the United States. Germany does not need President Trump in order to engage with partners who are interested in climate policy cooperation. A number of states (not just California) and large cities are already rapidly reducing their CO2 emissions. Political, scientific, and technical cooperation with local partners is possible. There is no shortage of potent allies on climate policy in the United States, in the private sector as well as in civil society. Here, the key is to be proactive, to invest money, and to build networks that will endure and outlast the Trump administration.Digital policy is another policy area where confrontation is possible — about regulatory questions as well as about market shares. It is important to identify points of contention as soon as possible and to avoid unnecessary escalation. Sealing off Europe’s and the United States’ digital markets from each other will seriously damage the outlook for jobs and growth on both sides of the Atlantic. European consumer and data protection standards might be able to be maintained globally if they have U.S. support, but certainly not without it.12. Final point — more Europe within the AllianceMaking progress with the Trump administration wherever possible, moderating conflicts and avoiding escalation, expanding the spectrum of trans-Atlantic partners beyond the current U.S. administration — these are all core aims of a U.S. strategy that can preserve the trans-Atlantic partnership with and if necessary against this American President, and function beyond his time in office. The United States has proved its capacity for self-correction repeatedly. America remains the indispensable power for those countries that stand for freedom and democracy and strive for an open world order. But Europe — and thus Germany — must do more to support and preserve these values. More European self-reliance is imperative. It would be an error of historical proportions to play out “more Europe” against the trans-Atlantic alliance. The new German government’s foreign policy will be measured by how clearly it pursues this course.Authors:• Deidre Berger, Ramer Institute, American Jewish Committee, Berlin• James D.

And given Monday’s developments, they’re not the only ones who should be afraid of being ensnared in Mr. Mueller’s spreading net.Both men pleaded not guilty. The crimes they are charged with are very serious — money laundering alone carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison — but on their own they suggest no immediate link to the original subject of Mr. Mueller’s investigation: possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to help swing the election to Mr. Trump, and any subsequent cover-up of that collusion.Mr. Trump was eager to highlight that point, tweeting on Monday morning, “there is NO COLLUSION!”Surprise! Soon after Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates turned themselves in, newly unsealed court documents revealed that another Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the F.B.I. about conversations he had with a professor who had substantial ties to Russian government officials.The professor introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to a woman he claimed was a relative of President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Then in April 2016 he told Mr. Papadopoulos that Moscow had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” Mr. Papadopoulos tried for several months to arrange a meeting between the Trump campaign and the Russians, including Mr. Putin.But in a late-January interview with F.B.I. investigators, Mr. Papadopoulos said that the professor had contacted him well before he joined the campaign and that the professor was “a nothing” who was “B.S.’ing to be completely honest with you.”Mr. Papadopoulos was not telling the truth, as it turned out. He had joined the Trump campaign as a foreign policy adviser in early March 2016, more than a month before speaking with the professor about the “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton. On July 27 of this year, he was arrested, and began cooperating with Mr. Mueller — a carrot-and-stick strategy that Mr. Mueller is most likely to keep using to try to turn other Trump associates. On Oct. 5 Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal officials.The guilty plea is the most direct evidence connecting the campaign to the Russian efforts to help elect Mr. Trump. After days of dishonesty, the White House acknowledged in July that Mr. Manafort and Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had attended a meeting arranged by Donald Trump Jr. with Kremlin-connected intermediaries who said they had dirt on Mrs. Clinton. And the Trump adviser Roger Stone (recently kicked off Twitter for abusive and profane tweets) has acknowledged having contacts with WikiLeaks, which has been a conduit for Russian-hacked emails.And yet the White House’s response Monday was essentially “George who?” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, called Mr. Papadopoulos a campaign “volunteer” who worked in an “extremely limited” role — a characterization that’s hard to square with the fact that Mr. Trump identified him, along with four other people, as a member of his foreign-policy team in March 2016. And then there were the numerous communications between Mr. Papadopoulos and top campaign officials about meeting with the Russians, including one encouraging Mr. Papadopoulos to “make the trip” to Moscow, “if it is feasible.”But back to Mr. Manafort. Mr. Trump tweeted Monday that the allegations in the indictment concern activities from “years ago,” before Mr. Manafort joined the campaign, and complained once again that the investigation was not focused on “Crooked Hillary and the Dems.” Putting aside Mr. Trump’s bizarre fixation with a political opponent he bested nearly a year ago, he’s wrong about the indictment, which explicitly alleges illegal behavior that continued through 2017.Anyway, whether Mr. Trump was aware of any of the specific details in the indictment is beside the point. He certainly must have known what he was getting in hiring Mr. Manafort. A Republican lobbyist and political consultant, Mr. Manafort has a long history of enriching himself working for some of the world’s most unscrupulous and dictatorial leaders, including Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, Jonas Savimbi in Angola and Mobutu Sese Seko of the Democratic Republic of Congo — not a list most American presidential candidates would want to be on. More recently, he helped to elect the pro-Kremlin Viktor Yanukovych as president of Ukraine. In 2014, Mr. Yanukovych fled the country for Russia in the face of street protests, opening the door for Mr. Putin to destabilize the country.The indictment charges that Mr. Manafort used overseas shell companies to launder more than $18 million of the tens of millions of dollars he raked in through his Ukraine work, and used that untaxed money to buy multimillion-dollar properties, luxury cars and fancy suits. Mr. Gates, a former protégé of Mr. Manafort’s, was charged with laundering more than $3 million. Both men were also accused of lying to bookkeepers, tax accountants and lawyers as part of their scheme.Mr. Manafort, in other words, embodies the sort of amoral, self-dealing denizen of the swamp that Mr. Trump pledged to drain when he got to Washington. What the president did not anticipate was that Mr. Mueller would be the one doing the draining.', "                                    A piece of cake from the couple's 2005 nuptials is up for bid at a Los Angeles auction house.

Some fear that walking away from the deal could compromise chances of encouraging North Korea to negotiate on its nuclear program.Trump "decertified" the deal Friday, angrily accusing Iran of violating it, and directed the U.S. Congress to make it more stringent.The International Atomic Energy Agency has certified eight times that Iran was living up to its commitments.', '', 'JERUSALEM – The diplomatic adviser of President Mahmoud Abbas says the Palestinian leadership would "stop contacts" with the United States if President Donald Trump recognizes Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital.U.S. officials have said a possible recognition might come this week, prompting mounting Arab and Muslim criticism.Abbas\' aide Majdi Khaldi said on Tuesday the U.S. would lose credibility as a Mideast mediator if Trump goes ahead with the move.East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, is home to major Muslim, Christian and Jewish holy sites.

Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting as a presidential candidate — and his role in drafting a misleading statement about it once he was president and it became public — are key questions for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian interference in the election.Donald Trump Jr. had agreed to the meeting after receiving an email stating that a Russian government lawyer would provide incriminating facts about Mrs. Clinton as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” He has said that no damaging information was delivered.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said after Wednesday’s session that Donald Trump Jr. acknowledged that he had discussed the Trump Tower meeting by telephone with his father on July 10. The congressman said that Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Alan S. Futerfas, asked the committee for more time to answer questions about that conversation because both he and a lawyer for the president were privy to it.Mr. Schiff said that he believed the contents of the phone call should not be kept secret simply because lawyers participated in it. “The presence of counsel does not make communications between father and son a privilege,” he said. He added that he would follow up with Mr. Futerfas about the legal basis for refusing to disclose what was discussed.Republicans on the committee who attended the session, which lasted roughly eight hours, said that they felt that Donald Trump Jr. had been forthcoming.While he refused to recount his conversation with his father, the younger Mr. Trump told the committee about his earlier discussions with the White House adviser Hope Hicks about how to respond to the coming Times article, first published on July 8. His statement said the Trump Tower meeting was primarily about the ability of Americans to adopt Russian children. It made no mention of any promise of incriminating information from the Russian government against Mrs. Clinton.Committee members also questioned the younger Mr. Trump at length about a series of phone calls and email exchanges that occurred several days before the Trump Tower meeting. He said that he was unable to remember a phone call that took place as he was discussing the need for the meeting with a Russian intermediary, according to three people familiar with his testimony, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe closed proceedings.In an email to the younger Mr. Trump, a publicist linked to Aras Agalarov — a Russian real estate magnate who has been honored by the Kremlin — promised damaging information about Mrs. Clinton. Donald Trump Jr. had two phone calls with Mr. Agalarov’s son Emin, each lasting just a few minutes, before the meeting. Between those calls, his phone records show, he either received or placed a third call with an unidentified person whose telephone number was blocked. Mr. Trump testified that he could not remember what the call was about or whom it was with.Mr. Trump was also asked about his private Twitter communications last fall with WikiLeaks, the antisecrecy group whose release of a trove of hacked emails rocked Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. Mr. Trump told the committee that he considered WikiLeaks to be an independent news organization much like CNN or NBC — not an organization that disseminated material provided by the Russian government, as American intelligence agencies later concluded.', 'Democrat says he won\'t attend the Mississippi event because the president is slated to appear.U.S. Rep. John Lewis says he won\'t attend the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, calling it intolerable that President Donald Trump is slated to appear.The Georgia Democrat and civil rights icon made the announcement Thursday afternoon, adding that he would reconsider only if Trump decides not to attend, according to theAtlanta Journal-Constitution.“Right now we’re not going,” Lewis told the newspaper. “But there’s a possibility that the head man may not show up, may cancel.”The lawmaker’s recent comments came one day after he first expressed doubts about appearing on the same program as the president. “I think his presence would make a mockery of everything that people tried to do to redeem the soul of America and to make this country better,” Lewis said in comments on Wednesday.Several prominent Mississippi Democrats say they won\'t attend. Some plan protests. Lewis’ house colleague, Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said he would not attend.In a joint statement, Lewis and Thompson explained their decision."Right now we’re not going. But there’s a possibility that the head man may not show up, may cancel.""Trump’s attendance and his hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed in this civil rights museum. The struggles represented in this museum exemplify the truth of what really happened in Mississippi,” reads the statement. “President Trump’s disparaging comments about women, the disabled, immigrants and National Football League players disrespect the efforts of Fannie Lou Hamer, Aaron Henry, Medgar Evers, Robert Clark, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and countless others who have given they\'re all for Mississippi to be a better place."The White House responded to the statement late Thursday afternoon. “We think it’s unfortunate that these members of Congress wouldn’t join the president in honoring the incredible sacrifice civil rights leaders made to right the injustices in our history,” Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. “The president hopes others will join him in recognizing that the movement was about removing barriers and unifying Americans of all backgrounds.”The Saturday ceremony marks Mississippi\'s bicentennial of admission to the Union. But what was intended as a moment of racial unity and atonement in the state where some four in 10 residents are African-American is descending into racial and partisan strife after Gov. Phil Bryant invited fellow Republican Trump to attend.The NAACP has said Trump should cancel his planned appearance because of his divisive record on civil rights issues.“President Trump’s statements and policies regarding the protection and enforcement of civil rights have been abysmal, and his attendance is an affront to the veterans of the civil rights movement,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson said ina statement on Wednesday. “He has created a commission to reinforce voter suppression, refused to denounce white supremacists, and overall, has created a racially hostile climate in this nation.”', '\'MediaBuzz\' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on Hillary Clinton attempting to turn the Weinstein sexual assault scandal onto President Trump only to have reports bring up former President Bill Clinton\'s scandals.Hillary Clinton is very much on the defensive about Harvey Weinstein.So she’s changing the subject to…Donald Trump.Which is, of course, a classic tactic of deflection that others are trying as well.The former presidential candidate said she was “shocked and appalled” by the mounting sexual assault and harassment allegations against Weinstein, a big-time Democratic donor who threw a fundraiser for her. The movie mogul also donated $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation.Yet it took Clinton nearly six days to be shocked and appalled, even as some of her fellow Democrats were speaking out and returning or donating Weinstein’s donations.My view is that this is the kind of hyper-caution she exhibited during the campaign. Hillary couldn’t figure out what to do about Harvey, so she said nothing until the pressure got too great. And that drew criticism even from many mainstream journalists.On Sunday, Clinton told the BBC’s Andrew Marr that we shouldn’t just focus on Weinstein but “recognize that this behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere, whether it is in entertainment, or politics–after all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office. There has to be a recognition that we must stand against this kind of action, which is so sexist and misogynistic.”Taking a deep breath.First, Trump has not “admitted” to engaging in sexual assault. On the “Access Hollywood” outtakes, made public a year ago, he talked to Billy Bush about grabbing women—but in his apology, Trump said it was just locker-room talk.In the wake of that tape, a number of women accused the candidate of harassing or groping them, allegations that Trump denied. Many in the media thought that would derail his campaign, but it didn’t.It’s worth pointing out, without minimizing those allegations in any way, that five women have now accused Weinstein of rape.And by the way, the Clinton Foundation isn’t returning Weinstein’s 250K, saying the money’s already been spent. (Clinton did tell CNN she might donate a similar amount to charity.)But in decrying sexual assault in the Oval Office, Hillary seems to be airbrushing from history a recent president who did admit having sex with a young staffer in that very space…her husband.Even if you leave aside the allegations involving Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick and others, there is no evading the fact that Bill Clinton lied about his sexual misconduct with Monica Lewinsky.When Marr, to his credit, asked about Trump bringing some of her husband’s accusers to the second debate, Hillary Clinton said “that had all been litigated. That was the subject of a huge investigation as you might recall in the late \'90s and there were conclusions drawn and that was clearly in the past.”So, it’s old news? That’s all she’s got?Trump slapped back with this tweet: “I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020? My answer was, ‘I hope so!’”Clinton is done running for office, as Trump well knows. She’s out there facing questions because of her book tour, and there was no way she could duck the Weinstein mess.But by trying to turn the controversy against Trump, she left herself wide open for questions about the 42nd president, unintentionally turning the focus back to the dark days of impeachment.Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m.).

Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz.', 'TOKYO – President Donald Trump ratcheted up the pressure on North Korea Monday, refusing to rule out eventual military action and declaring that the United States "will not stand" for Pyongyang menacing America or its Asian allies.Trump, on the first stop of his lengthy Asia trip, denounced North Korea as "a threat to the civilized world," and exhorted dictator Kim Jong Un to cease weapons testing like the missiles he has fired over Japanese territory in recent weeks. Though he stood in one of the Asia capitals in range of North Korea\'s missiles, Trump did not modulate his fiery language, declaring that Pyongyang imperiled "international peace and stability.""Some people say my rhetoric is very strong but look what has happened with very weak rhetoric in the last 25 years," said Trump, who stood with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a Monday news conference.Abe, who has taken a more hawkish view on North Korea than some of his predecessors, agreed with Trump\'s assessment that "all options are on the table" when dealing with Kim Jong Un and announced new sanctions against several dozen North Korea individuals.Trump and Abe have struck a strong friendship, forged in meetings, phone calls and on the golf course — a friendship that was on display at a Monday evening banquet that was the final event of Trump\'s visit. In a toast, Trump told the story of how, after he won the election last November, he was bombarded by phone calls from world leaders offering congratulations. Trump said he\'d returned just a few — including one from Abe — who said he wanted to meet with Trump as soon as possible. Trump responded: anytime.Trump, as he told it, wasn\'t aware of the protocol against president-elects meeting with world leaders. By the time Trump called Abe to wave him off, however, Trump said Abe was already on the plane to New York. "So I saw him and it worked out just fine," Trump recalled, saying, from that moment on, they\'d been close.Abe also called Trump his "dear friend" and hailed the benefits of what he called "golf diplomacy."The two men on Monday also put a face on the threat posed by the North, earlier standing with anguished families of Japanese citizens snatched by Pyongyang\'s agents.Trump and first lady Melania Trump stood with nearly two dozen relatives, some of whom held photos of the missing. Seeking to increase pressure on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump pledged to work to return the missing to their families, saying "it\'s a very, very sad number of stories that we\'ve heard."North Korea has acknowledged apprehending 13 Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s, but claims they all died or have been released. But in Japan, where grieving relatives of the abducted have become a symbol of heartbreak on the scale of American POW families, the government insists many more were taken — and that some may still be alive.Trump has delivered harsh denunciations of Kim, belittling him as "Little Rocket Man" but suggested that it would be "a tremendous signal" if North Korea returned the captives.But Trump\'s message on the second day of his five-country Asian tour was overshadowed by another tragic shooting back home.Trump called the Texas church shooting that claimed at least 26 lives "an act of evil," denounced the violence in "a place of sacred worship" and pledged the full support of the federal government. He later suggested that the shooter had mental health issues and waved off a question about gun control, saying of the massacre, "this isn\'t a guns situation."Though Trump and Abe repeatedly touted their friendship, looming disagreements on trade could strain the friendship.Trump complained Monday that Japan had been "winning" for decades and rebuked the current relationship, saying the trade deals were "not fair and not open." He told a group of American and Japanese business leaders: the United States was open for business, but he wanted to reshape the nations\' trade relationship, though he did not say how he would cut the trade deficit with Japan, which totaled nearly $70 billion last year.He also downplayed the potentially contentious nature of the negotiations, though the Japanese government has not shown much appetite for striking a new bilateral trade agreement. Tokyo had pushed to preserve the Trans- Pacific Partnership, which Trump has abandoned."We will have more trade than anybody ever thought under TPP. That I can tell you," Trump said. He said the multinational agreement was not the right deal for the United States and that while "probably some of you in this room disagree ... ultimately I\'ll be proven to be right."Abe, for his part, publicly deflected questions about trade.Trump also pushed Japan to buy more American military equipment after Abe was asked at the news conference about a local news report that Trump was disappointed that Japan had not shot North Korean missiles out of the sky."He will shoot \'em out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States," Trump interrupted.Japan\'s constitution was revised after World War II to include a clause renouncing war and the country only spends about one percent of its GDP on defense, though Abe has slowly tried to remove some of its pacifist constraints.Japan orchestrated a lavish formal welcome for the Trumps, complete with military honor guard and an audience with Japan\'s Emperor Akihito and his wife, Empress Michiko, at the Imperial Palace.As part of the pageantry, Trump and Abe took part in a traditional feeding of koi in a pond Monday. At first, both leaders spooned out small amounts of feed into the pond below. Abe then lightly tossed the remainder of his box into the pond below, while Trump more theatrically dumped the rest of his box down to the fish.Abe laughed.___Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Colvin at http://twitter.com/@colvinj', '                                    Chelsea Handler was blasted for blaming President Trump for the California wildfires.

This past week, Bob Corker, a sitting U.S. Senator, called the White House a home for an addled geriatric, and accused the president of castrating Rex Tillerson, his Secretary of State. Meanwhile, Steve Bannon, Trump’s campaign guru and former senior White House advisor, bet against Trump finishing out his first term, as the head of Breitbart fixed his gaze on the Twenty Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Over in the realm of policy, Trump declared war on ObamaCare, the Iran Deal, the First Amendment and UNESCO. As long as Trump occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, don’t expect this tumultuous cacophony to disappear. It is America’s new normal.Enter “One Nation After Trump: A Guide for the Perplexed, the Disillusioned, the Desperate, and the Not-Yet Deported,” a 352-page prayer and how-to book, written by three members of the D.C. establishment, E.J. Dionne of the Washington Post, Norman Ornstein of the Brookings Institute, and Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institute. “One Nation After Trump” offers a sincere and detailed blueprint for a neo-liberal restoration. And that is its problem. The book fails to adequately internalize the rage that in 2016 overturned America’s post-Reagan status quo. Beyond that, the authors seemingly fail to recognize that politics is transactional, and lack a message and offering powerful enough to lure Obama-Trump voters back to the Democratic column. Most of all, there is an empathy shortage for those who find themselves outside of the Democrats’ current upstairs-downstairs coalition.As Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and former advisor to President Bill Clinton, trenchantly framed things, “If the life expectancy of, say, Somali immigrants in Minnesota suddenly took a dive, Democrats would be falling all over each other trying to ascertain the causes and advocate the cures. We owe white working-class Americans no less.”The book fails to adequately internalize the rage that in 2016 overturned America’s post-Reagan status quo. Yet, “One Nation” does not come close, even as it awkwardly tries. The book contains a detailed discussion of America’s changing demographics, its historic high levels of immigration, and the resulting friction and resentment. A significant portion of Trump voters feels like strangers in their house, and “One Nation” does not satisfactorily address that disconnect. Rather, its authors seems intent on pushing ahead with a prescription of open borders and multiculturalism, the same recipe that made Trump a reality. This approach may sound like sweet music to the chattering class, but is unlikely to impress those voters who cast a ballot for Barack Obama in 2008 or 2012 and then for Donald Trump a year ago.The glaring realities are also that at the end of the day 700,000 white employees lost their jobs as the result of the Great Recession, that white life expectancy outside the reach of high-end America has declined, and that with the exceptions of Maine and Vermont military service is the domain of Red America. As Andrew Sullivan observed in New York Magazine, in recent years the number of deaths attributable to drug overdoses exceeds the annual death rate from AIDS. However, no one is wearing ribbons. The powder that exploded last November was all around.At the same time, polling from Gallup had reflected a pre-election groundswell in Americans’ self-identification as working class. At the turn of the century, only one-third of Americans identified themselves as such. Yet by 2015, the figure had risen to nearly one-half. Fortunately, the number of Americans who see themselves as working class has since receded to pre-recession levels, with only 36 percent calling themselves working class as of June 2017. As the scholar, Barrington Moore Jr., said, “No bourgeoisie, no democracy.”“One Nation” is on more solid ground in identifying the threat that the Trump presidency represents to American norms and institutions. Hardly a day goes by without Trump taking aim at both. An independent judiciary, a functioning diplomatic corps, and a free press have all been Trump targets. Yet, Trump’s core supporters are either undisturbed or are actively rooting for their guy. Clearly, “modern” presidential has more than a few followers.Against this backdrop, it looks like Dionne, Ornstein, and Mann, “One Nation’s” authors, have a lot of persuading to do. Whether they are simply preaching to the choir, or leave a real mark remains to be seen.Lloyd Green is the managing member of Ospreylytics, LLC, a research and analytics firm, was staff secretary to George H.W.

In some ways, he’s a throwback to days when authority and power were exclusively white and male by definition, when displays of masculine entitlement were overt and unapologetic. But he’s also a thoroughly modern man-child, the kind of overgrown adolescent you expect to find on internet forums dedicated to video games or anti-feminism: a tweeter of juvenile threats, a crass name-caller, an id unrestrained. Trump-style masculinity, in other words, is less John Wayne and more Tucker Max — and a revealing insight into American male anxiety.American manhood is reshaping itself in two opposing directions, and both archetypes are ones we’ve never seen before. If Barack Obama embodied the new ideal of the progressive man — a hands-on dad and a self-identified feminist married to a high-achieving woman who was once his boss, who is also well mannered and protective of his family — then Mr. Trump is his antithesis, an old-school chauvinist embracing a new code of adolescent anarchy. He is a paradigm of feckless male entitlement, embracing male power while abnegating the traditional masculine requirements of chivalry, courtesy and responsibility.Almost a year ago, he won the presidential election by presenting this version of aggrieved manhood in opposition to Hillary Clinton’s hand-raising Hermione Granger feminism. White American men loved it.This happened while, in homes across America, the Obama model of manhood had increasingly taken root. Yes, powerful men do abuse their positions to extract sexual services from women or to remind us that no matter how mighty and successful we are, we can be reduced to simple objects of predatory male sexuality. The past few weeks have been a stark reminder that these abuses don’t fall along partisan lines, with the Harvey Weinstein revelations and stories across industries and continents still unfolding in their wake.Most men also continue to fall short when it comes to household responsibilities, and men still tend to out-earn women. But, in much of America, men’s and women’s lives look more similar than they ever have: Women do more work for pay, and men do more care work than they previously have done. Feminists have insisted that women and men alike can and should embody the characteristics we positively associate with both masculinity (power, respect, dependability, providing) and femininity (caregiving, devotion, compassion), and many of our lives have crept closer to this ideal.To Mr. Trump and many of his increasingly nihilistic supporters, this is a threat to their fantasy of masculinity. We could have guessed that men who believe in gender equality would do more housework than men with conservative views, and it is not news that white conservative men overwhelmingly vote Republican. What is different from generations before is that many of the men making up Mr. Trump’s base are less attached to the institutions that offered respect and required responsibility — unions, church, marriage, school, even independent living. In the face of women’s success, many of them have fallen behind on adult obligations and fallen back on misogyny.Many of these men now seek community online. Mr. Trump knows how to speak to them, and he adopted the modern man-child’s medium. When he tweets insults about the stature of those who challenge him — “Liddle Bob Corker” and “Little Marco” Rubio — he’s not just emasculating his tormentors by suggesting that manly authority is tied to height (although he’s doing that, too); he’s adopting the ad hominem rhetorical tactics that are a staple of angry men on Twitter and Reddit.Today, young women are more likely to attend college than young men, while young men are more likely to live with their parents, and it’s not only student loan debt that’s driving them home. Economic shifts that have decreased employment in blue-collar jobs but increased opportunity in female-dominated sectors have had a psychic as well as financial impact. Care jobs are not jobs men are generally willing to take, in part because of the depressed pay, but also because of social constraints: Nursing, elder care and child care are women’s work.A desire to reclaim this psychic masculinity is why Mr. Trump fetishizes a specific (and specifically white) kind of rough-hewed American maleness while embodying an envy-inducing lack of obligation. The white working men of Trump speeches have the kind of dirty-fingernail jobs so revered in the American imagination: coal miners, firefighters, autoworkers. In real life, more Trump voters work in cubicles than in coal mines. But the point was never Mr. Trump’s understanding of reality. It was his grasp of white male aspiration and identity.Mr. Trump’s own life and actions paint an appealing picture of masculine entitlement for those who want power without the shackles of responsibility. He may not be the smartest or most qualified guy in just about any room, but his money allowed him to marry and reproduce with a succession of models, star in a reality television show, live in vulgar gold-plated glory, say whatever offensive thing danced through his brain and still make a successful run for president. It was a plus that in the three Trump marriages, there have been no “power couple” partnerships of equals, just Mr. Trump on “The Howard Stern Show” talking about his wife’s breasts and bragging that he never changed a diaper.Most American men are unable to actually achieve this level of authority minus accountability; as a result, admiration for men like Mr. Trump gets paired with an “if I can’t have it, no one can” nihilism. White male power remains a dominant force in America, but it is no longer the only force that matters. For many men, this is not a leveling of the playing field, but a plundering of what was rightly theirs.Resentful of the changing order of things, some men have simply leaned in to chaos: If the system no longer serves them, it will at least be fun to blow it all up. Which is exactly why the old rules of political engagement don’t work with Mr. Trump or his base.The president is a perfect figurehead for this bizarre moment: a man who carries all of the negative characteristics of stereotypical masculinity while adopting almost none of the virtues, occupying the most powerful and exclusively male seat of power in the nation (and perhaps in the world), who ascended in large part because a yawning fear of female power kept one of the best-qualified candidates in history out of office. He is ego unchecked, narcissism in place of dignity.In a 1961 essay for Vogue, Joan Didion wrote that people with “self-respect have the courage of their mistakes. They know the price of things.” The piece went on to say, “In brief, people with self-respect exhibit a certain toughness, a kind of moral nerve; they display what was once called character.” Character, she wrote, is “the willingness to accept responsibility for one’s own life.”Our current president, who can’t even accept responsibility for his own social media use or admit that all-caps tweeting might suggest he’s angry about continuing criminal investigations and low poll numbers, may indeed be a new low. Mr. Trump has ushered in a fresh era of noxious manhood wherein bullying is conflated with toughness and self-interest is more important than self-respect. But all is not lost. Every generation believes it is uniquely observing diminishing standards of behavior, even while by most measures, life improves.

She\'s since been bombarded by reporters and can\'t leave her house.Scrivener told Britain\'s Press Association that she wanted to stay out of the debate between the UK leader and Trump — but says he should think before tweeting.She says, "Our profiles are completely different. She runs the country, I\'m a mum from Bognor."', 'WASHINGTON – The Trump administration put the Palestinians on notice Friday that it will shutter their office in Washington unless they’ve entered serious peace talks with Israel, U.S. officials said, potentially giving President Donald Trump more leverage as he seeks an elusive Mideast peace deal.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has determined that the Palestinians ran afoul of an obscure provision in a U.S. law that says the Palestine Liberation Organization’s mission must close if the Palestinians try to get the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israelis for crimes against Palestinians. A State Department official said that in September, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas crossed that line by calling on the ICC to investigate and prosecute Israelis.But the law leaves the president a way out, so Tillerson’s declaration doesn’t necessarily mean the office will close.Trump now has 90 days to consider whether the Palestinians are in “direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel.” If Trump determines they are, the Palestinians can keep the office. The official said it was unclear whether the U.S. might close the office before the 90-day period expires, but said the mission remains open at least for now.Even if the office closes, the U.S. said it wasn’t cutting off relations with the Palestinians and was still focused on “a comprehensive peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.” The State Department official said in an email that “this measure should in no way be seen as a signal that the U.S. is backing off those efforts.” The official wasn’t authorized to be identified by name and requested anonymity.The PLO office and the Israeli Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Although the Israelis and Palestinians are not engaged in active, direct negotiations, Trump’s administration has been working all year to broker a peace deal that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Led by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior aide, White House officials have been preparing a peace proposal they intend to put forward at an unspecified time.The Palestinians, though publicly supportive of the U.S. effort, have been skeptical because Trump’s close ties to Israel suggest whatever deal he proposes might be unfavorable to them. The threat of losing their office in the U.S. capital could become another pressure point as the Trump administration seeks to persuade the Palestinians to come to the table.The Palestine Liberation Organization is the group that formally represents all Palestinians. Although the U.S. does not recognize Palestinian statehood, the PLO maintains a “general delegation” office in Washington that facilitates Palestinian officials’ interactions with the U.S. government.The United States allowed the PLO to open a mission in Washington in 1994, a move that required then-President Bill Clinton to waive a law that said the Palestinians couldn’t have an office. In 2011, under the Obama administration, the United States started letting the Palestinians fly their flag over the office, an upgrade to the status of their mission that the Palestinians hailed as historic.Israel opposes any Palestinian membership in United Nations-related organizations until a peace deal has been reached.The Trump administration has not revealed any details about its effort to bring about a peace deal that would ostensibly grant the Palestinians an independent state in exchange for an end to its conflict with the Israelis. But Kushner and other top Trump aides have been shuttling to the region to meet with Palestinians, Israelis and officials from neighboring Arab nations as it prepares to put forward a peace plan.The requirement that the PLO office be closed if the Palestinians back an International Criminal Court move came in a little-noticed provision in U.S. law that says the United States can’t allow the Palestinians to have a Washington office if they try to “influence a determination by the ICC to initiate a judicially authorized investigation, or to actively support such an investigation, that subjects Israeli nationals to an investigation for alleged crimes against Palestinians.”Abbas, the Palestinian leader, said in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in September that the Palestinians had “called on the International Criminal Court to open an investigation and to prosecute Israeli officials for their involvement in settlement activities and aggressions against our people.”The U.S. law says that if the government determines the Palestinians have breached that requirement, it triggers a 90-day review period in which the president must decide whether to let the office stay open anyway. The president is allowed to waive the requirement only if he certifies to Congress “that the Palestinians have entered into direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel.”The provision doesn’t explicitly define what would constitute direct or meaningful negotiations.', '', "                                    U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a joint press conference with South Korea's President Moon Jae-in (not pictured) at the presidential Blue House in Seoul, South Korea, November 7, 2017.

Duke delayed the final decision to learn more about the situation, but extended the status for six months – up until July 2018.Both programs were set to expire in next year in January.The TPS program covers more than 400,000 people from 9 countries that were subject to war or natural disasters and whose citizens came to the U.S – either legally or illegally – and prevents any deportations.The scheme, initially enacted by a presidential decree back in 1990, was meant to be temporary, but both the Bush and Obama administrations extended the program, fearing the countries could not cope if the residents returned to their homelands.Trump ended the permits for Sudan in September and issued a shorter program renewal for almost 60,000 immigrants from Haiti who were allowed to gain the permit following the 2010 earthquake.The Associated Press contributed to this report.", '                                    CNN is boycotting the White House Christmas party for the media, a network spokesperson said on Tuesday.

The number of layoffs is slightly lower than the 275 employees who initially would have been impacted – the company said fewer workers were affected because of voluntary attrition.Employees at the Indianapolis plant reportedly do not feel they have job security."They just don\'t have any faith in this plant staying in Indianapolis,"Robert James, the president of a union that represents plant workers,told The Indianapolis Star.Shortly after Trump’s election, Carrier announcedthat it had reached a deal with the then president-elect to keep approximately 1,070 jobs in Indianapolis for 10 years in exchange for up to $7 million in various incentives.The highly publicized deal, which protected about 730 manufacturing jobs, abruptly reversed the plan Carrier announced in February 2016 to move its factory to Mexico and eliminate nearly 1,400 jobs.Although Carrier employees appeared elated in widely circulated photographs after Trump struck the deal with the company, the mood in Indianapolis has apparently soured as layoffs continue.“Trump came in there to the factory last December and blew smoke up our a---s,” Brenda Darlene Battle, a longtime Carrier employee, toldThe New Yorker. “He wasn’t gonna save those jobs.”But the company said in a statement: “More than 1,100 jobs remain at the Indianapolis facility in keeping with our 2016 commitment.”Gregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

So you have a strange, in fact surreal, situation whereby China is now presenting itself as the guardian of the global economic order."A look at how new approaches from Trump and Xi have countries in Southeast Asia attempting a sometimes awkward balancing act:___TRUMP: "RADICALLY DIFFERENT"Perhaps Trump was always destined to come up short in any Asia comparison with his predecessor, Barack Obama, whose childhood was partly spent in Indonesia and Hawaii.Obama, who hosted Southeast Asian leaders last year in the United States, made much of a supposed "pivot" of U.S. attention back to Asia after what his administration portrayed as years of neglect.The biggest signal that Trump appeared willing to cede ground to China came shortly after his January inauguration, when he withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, saying he preferred one-on-one pacts that brought more benefits to the United States.Obama had presented the deal among Pacific Rim countries, including Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Singapore, as symbolic of U.S. commitment to the region — and a crucial curb of Chinese power.As the remaining TPP countries discuss ways to do the deal without Washington, critics say Trump\'s protectionism will allow China to establish greater inroads.During a recent trip to Washington, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong nicely summarized the dilemma many in the region face because of a "radically different approach" under Trump.The Chinese, Lee said, will pursue their objectives "assiduously, quietly farming away, and they will make friends and influence people whether or not you (the United States) are there, and if you are not there, then everybody else in the world will look around and say, \'I want to be friends with both the U.S. and the Chinese, and the Chinese are ready and I will start with them.\'"Trump is set to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam, where he may offer up a broader Asia policy, and meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in the Philippines.A scheduled meeting with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte could be a good signal on how Trump may be received in the region.Duterte, who rejected Trump\'s White House invitation earlier this year, recently told reporters in the Philippines, a U.S. treaty ally, that he would welcome Trump as "the important leader on this side of the planet."___XI: STANDING "TALL AND FIRM"During his speech last month at the twice-a-decade Communist Party congress, Xi, who has cemented his status as China\'s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, declared that his nation "now stands tall and firm in the East."China\'s judgment that the U.S. is in decline, which can be traced to the onset of the global financial crisis in 2009, "is even more certain today, as it sees U.S. global leadership eroding under President Donald Trump," Bonnie Glaser and Matthew Funaiole, China experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, wrote recently.Part of the explanation for China\'s rise in Southeast Asia is Beijing\'s decision last year to "proactively moderate" its positions on the South China Sea, which it claims nearly in its entirety, said Shi Yinhong, an international relations expert at Renmin University of China.Beijing has also made progress because of what its critics call a willingness to support countries in the region accused of systematic human rights abuse or corruption.China\'s huge shipments of aid and investment to Cambodia help to enable long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen\'s authoritarianism and repression of the press and political opposition.Thailand\'s military rulers, who ousted an elected government in a 2014 coup, have cultivated ties with Beijing as a counterbalance to a disapproving West.Xi\'s biggest move in the region, the "One Belt, One Road" initiative, seeks to link China to Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond with a sprawling network of roads, railways, ports and other economic projects.There have been worries about political and economic interference as Beijing pitches one part of that effort — a high-speed rail system — to Southeast Asian nations.But negotiations in Indonesia and Thailand "notably suggest that rather than acting as a bully and imposing its conditions on host countries, China has actually shown a great degree of flexibility and compromise," according to research and interviews conducted by China experts Agatha Kratz and Dragan Pavlicevic.As Chinese money, influence and political pressure flood the region, many countries struggle with how far into Beijing\'s sphere, and away from Washington, it\'s wise to go. Complicating the debate is strong anti-Chinese sentiment in certain areas.As a result, some countries have reserved judgment on Trump, raising the stakes for his Southeast Asia trip."They hope the Trump administration will be committed more to their region, but they do not want to take a stand or harm their relations with China," Shi said.___Associated Press writers Stephen Wright in Jakarta, Indonesia and Gillian Wong in Beijing contributed to this report.', 'SEOUL, South Korea – Softening his aggressive rhetoric, at least for the moment, President Donald Trump stood on South Korean soil Tuesday and urged North Korea to come to the negotiating table. It\'s time, he said, for the North to "make a deal" to rein in its nuclear weapons program.It was a striking shift in tone for the president, who for months has issued increasingly dire threats to answer any hostile North Korean action with "fire and fury." On Tuesday, his first day on the Korean Peninsula as president, Trump said he\'d seen "a lot of progress" in dealing with Pyongyang, though he stopped short of saying whether he wanted direct diplomatic talks."It makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal that is good for the people of North Korea and for the world," Trump said at a news conference with South Korean president Moon Jae-in. "I do see certain movement."Trump was winding down his visit to Seoul on Wednesday with an address to South Korea\'s National Assembly, where he was expected to outline his view of dangers posed by North Korea\'s nuclear weapons program. The next stop on his five-nation Asian tour: Beijing, where he will press China to constrict the North\'s economic lifeblood.Ever the showman, Trump teased that he had a surprise in store for Wednesday, saying at a Tuesday evening banquet that he had an "exciting day" planned — "for many reasons that people will find out." He did not elaborate.Overall, the president sounded an optimistic note on disagreements with the North, saying confidently, if vaguely: "Ultimately, it\'ll all work out." Whether the shift in rhetoric signaled a change in policy or diplomatic strategy remained uncertain.Mark Fitzpatrick, executive director in Washington for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said it could simply be Trump projecting "what he most recently heard" from Moon and Japan\'s Shinzo Abe."I expect he heard from both Prime Minister Abe and President Moon the need to give diplomacy a chance," Fitzpatrick said. "Of course, it\'s not the first time he has talked about engaging with North Korea. The issue has been one of timing. Now is a good time, during a pause in missile testing."North Korea has fired off more than a dozen missiles this year but none in nearly two months. But analysts caution against reading too much into the pause.There\'s no public sign of any diplomatic progress between Washington and Pyongyang. U.S. officials say the back channel between the State Department and the North Korean mission at the United Nations in New York remains intact, but contacts have not been substantive other than achieving the release of American college student Otto Warmbier in June. He died days after his repatriation to the U.S.Still, Trump\'s conciliatory comments would be welcome in South Korea, where both the government and the wider population have been unnerved by the president\'s threats against the North.Trump did note the United States\' military options, mentioning that three aircraft carrier groups and a nuclear submarine had been deployed to the region. But he said "we hope to God we never have to use" the arsenal. And he accused North Korea\'s Kim Jong Un of "threatening millions and millions of lives, so needlessly."Moon, who has been eager to solidify a friendship with Trump, said he hoped the president\'s visit would be a turning point in the standoff with North Korea.The president began his day with a visit to Camp Humphreys, a joint US-Korean military base where he shook hands with American and Korean service members and ate lunch with troops in a large mess hall. The visit was intended to underscore the countries\' ties and South Korea\'s commitment to contributing to its own defense.When he leaves South Korea, Trump flies to Beijing for what the White House sees as the centerpiece of his five-nation Asia trip.China is North Korea\'s largest trade partner, and Trump is expected to press its leaders to curtail their dealings with Pyongyang and to expel North Korean workers from its borders. Trump has praised China for adopting tough United Nations sanctions against North Korea but has urged it to do more."I want to just say that President Xi — where we will be tomorrow, China — has been very helpful. We\'ll find out how helpful soon," Trump said. "But he really has been very, very helpful. So China is out trying very hard to solve the problem with North Korea."Trump and first lady Melania Trump on Wednesday will meet and have dinner with Xi Jinping and his wife and receive a private tour of The Forbidden City, Beijing\'s ancient imperial palace. White House officials point to the leaders\' successful summit in Florida this spring, an event in part defined by Trump telling his Chinese counterpart about the missile strike he had ordered on Syria while the two men enjoyed chocolate cake. But experts in the region suggest that Xi will have the advantage over Trump."Trump keeps portraying his relationship with XI as great pals but that\'s wildly naive," said Mike Chinoy, a non-resident senior fellow at the US-China Institute at the University of Southern California. "The Chinese have figured out how to play Trump: flatter him. And there\'s nothing the Chinese do better than wow foreign diplomats."___Associated Press writers Matthew Pennington, Ken Thomas and Catherine Lucey contributed from Washington.___Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Colvin at http://twitter.com/@colvinj', "Fox News military analyst Oliver North reacts on 'Fox & Friends.'Amid rising nuclear tensions with North Korea and concern over the potential for war, the top U.S. nuclear commander said on Saturday that he would resist President Donald Trump if he ordered an “illegal” launch of nuclear weapons. Air Force General John Hyten, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), told an audience at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, Canada that he had thought a lot about what to say if he received such an order.“I think some people think we’re stupid,” Hyten said in response to a question about such a scenario, reports Reuters. “We’re not stupid people. We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?”Hyten, who is responsible for overseeing the U.S. nuclear arsenal, detailed the process that would follow such a command.As head of STRATCOM “I provide advice to the president, he will tell me what to do,” he said in his remarks, which were retransmitted in a video posted on the forum’s Facebook page.“And if it’s illegal, guess what’s going to happen? I‘m going to say, ‘Mr. President, that’s illegal.’ And guess what he’s going to do? He’s going to say, ‘What would be legal?’ And we’ll come up with options, of a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that’s the way it works. It’s not that complicated.”Hyten said running through scenarios of how to react in the event of an illegal order was standard practice, and added: “If you execute an unlawful order, you will go to jail. You could go to jail for the rest of your life.”The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Hyten’s remarks.The general’s comments came after U.S. lawmakers, including some Republicans, expressing concern about Trump’s authority to wage war using nuclear weapons.Trump has traded insults with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and threatened in his maiden United Nations address to “totally destroy” the country of 26 million people if it threatened America.Some senators want legislation to alter the nuclear authority of the U.S. president and a Senate committee on Tuesday held the first congressional hearing in more than four decades on the president’s authority to launch a nuclear strike.", "BEIJING – Following President Donald Trump's visit to Beijing, China says it's sending a high-level special envoy to North Korea amid an extended chill in relations between the neighbors over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and missile programs.The official Xinhua News Agency said Wednesday that director of the ruling Communist Party's International Liaison Department, Song Tao, would travel to Pyongyang on Friday to report on the party's national congress held last month.Xinhua made no mention of Trump's visit or the North's defense programs, although Trump has repeatedly called on Beijing to do more to use its influence to pressure Pyongyang into altering its behavior.Song would be the first ministerial-level Chinese official to visit North Korea since October 2015 when Politburo Standing Committee member Liu Yunshan met with leader Kim Jong Un.", 'Donald Trump\'s Twitter account was deactivated for 11 minutes by Twitter employee on his last day.

He\'ll then head to a private golf course for an informal lunch and golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe."It\'s going to be very positive and very historic," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One during the flight from Hawaii. "It\'s grueling, they tell me, but fortunately that\'s historically not been a problem for me. One thing you people will say, that\'s not been a problem."The 12-day, five-country trip, the longest Far East itinerary for a president in a generation, comes at a precarious moment for Trump. Just days ago, his former campaign chairman was indicted and another adviser pleaded guilty as part of an investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russian officials.The trip presents a crucial international test for a president looking to reassure Asian allies worried that his inward-looking "America First" agenda could cede power in the region to China. They also are rattled by his bellicose rhetoric about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The North\'s growing missile arsenal threatens the capitals Trump will visit."The trip comes, I would argue, at a very inopportune time for the president. He is under growing domestic vulnerabilities that we all know about, hour to hour," said Jonathan Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "The conjunction of those issues leads to the palpable sense of unease about the potential crisis in Korea."Trump\'s spontaneous, and at time reckless, style flies in the face of the generations-old traditions and protocol that govern diplomatic exchanges in Asia. The grand receptions expected for him in Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing and beyond are sure to be lavish attempts to impress the president, who raved about the extravagances shown him on earlier visits to Saudi Arabia and France.The trip will also put Trump in face-to-face meetings with authoritarian leaders for whom he has expressed admiration. They include China\'s Xi Jinping, whom Trump has likened to "a king," and the Philippines\' Rodrigo Duterte, who has sanctioned the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers.Trump may also have the chance for a second private audience with Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the sidelines of a summit in Vietnam.He told reporters that the meeting is "expected" to happen and that he "will want Putin\'s help" in dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis. Trump and Putin could cross paths twice during the president\'s lengthy Asia trip: at a summit in Vietnam and later in the Philippines. It was unclear where they would meet.Trump and Putin previously met along the sidelines of a summit in Europe this summer.The White House is signaling that Trump will push American economic interests in the region, but the North Korean threat is expected to dominate the trip. One of Trump\'s two major speeches will come before the National Assembly in Seoul. Fiery threats against the North could resonate differently than they do from the distance of Washington.Trump will forgo a trip to the Demilitarized Zone, the stark border between North and South Korea. All U.S. presidents except one since Ronald Reagan have visited the DMZ in a sign of solidarity with Seoul. The White House contends that Trump\'s commitment to South Korea is already crystal clear, as evidenced by his war of words with Kim and his threats to deliver "fire and fury" to North Korea if it does not stop threatening American allies.The escalation of rhetoric, a departure from the conduct of past presidents, has undermined confidence in the U.S. as a stabilizing presence in Asia."There\'s a danger if there is a lot of muscle flexing," said Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California. "Trump has been going right up to the edge and I wouldn\'t rule out some sort of forceful North Korean reaction to Trump\'s presence in the region," he said.The White House said Trump would be undeterred."The president will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously. That\'s been of great reassurance to our allies, partners and others in the region who are literally under the gun of this regime," White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Thursday. "I don\'t think the president really modulates his language, have you noticed?"At each stop, Trump will urge his hosts to squeeze North Korea by stopping trading with the North and sending home North Korean citizens working abroad. That includes China, which competes with the U.S. for influence in the region and provides much of North Korea\'s economic lifeblood.The White House is banking on the close relationships Trump has established with some Asian leaders to help make his demands more palatable.Officials acknowledge that Trump does not yet have a feel for Moon Jae-in, South Korea\'s newly elected liberal president. But Trump has demonstrated cordial relations with Xi and has struck up a friendship with Abe.While Xi and Abe have recently tightened their control on power, Trump arrives weakened by low poll numbers, a stalled domestic agenda and the swirling Russia probe.Many in the Asian capitals will view Trump warily.His early withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership demolished the Obama administration\'s effort to boost trade with some of the world\'s fastest-growing economies and sustain America\'s post-World War II strategic commitment to Asia.___Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Tokyo and Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report.___Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire', 'BEIJING – Ahead of President Donald Trump\'s visit to Beijing, literary luminaries such as Margaret Atwood and Philip Roth are calling on China to free the widow of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo.A letter issued through the writer\'s organization PEN America asks that China remove restrictions on Liu Xia\'s freedom of movement and allow her to meet freely with family, friends and members of the media.In a news release last week, PEN America Executive Director Suzanne Nossel said the writers hope Trump will "voice the United States\' concern about the inhumane and unjustifiable detention of a poet who has been accused of no crime."Liu Xia has been under unofficial house arrest since Liu Xiaobo was awarded the 2010 prize.

How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue? I would\'ve done same!My meetings with President Xi Jinping were very productive on both trade and the subject of North Korea. He is a highly respected and powerful representative of his people. It was great being with him and Madame Peng Liyuan!"How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue?" Trump went on. "I would\'ve done same!"Trump\'s Twitter posts echoed remarks Thursday, in which he said China "must immediately address the unfair trade practices" that drive a "shockingly" large trade deficit, along with barriers to market access, forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft."But I don\'t blame China," he said. "After all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens?"To applause, Trump said, "I give China great credit."Reacting from afar, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said Trump\'s comments "make the United States look weak and as if we are bowing to China\'s whim. ... Instead of giving China credit for stealing American jobs, the president should be holding China accountable." Menendez, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is on trial for bribery.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered a blunt assessment of China\'s trade surplus with the United States, which in October widened by 12.2 percent from a year earlier to $26.6 billion. The total surplus with the United States for the first 10 months of the year was $223 billion."I think the best way to characterize it is that while we appreciate the long hours and the effort that our Chinese counterparts have put into those trade discussions, quite frankly in the grand scheme of a $300- to $500-billion trade deficit, the things that have been achieved are pretty small," Tillerson told reporters in Beijing.Tillerson also acknowledged there were differences in "tactics and the timing and how far to go with pressure" on North Korea. But he insisted that the two countries shared common objectives."There is no disagreement on North Korea," he said.The comments by Trump and his top diplomat came after lengthy meetings with Xi. The day included announcements that the U.S. and China had signed agreements valued at more than $250 billion for products including U.S.-made jet engines, auto parts, liquefied natural gas and beef.Such contract signings, a fixture of foreign leaders\' visits to Beijing, are intended to defuse complaints about China\'s trade policies.Xi promised a more open business environment for foreign companies in China and said his country was committed to further opening its economy to outside investment."China will not close its doors" and will open them "even wider," he said, pledging that foreign companies in China, including American ones, would find the market "more open, more transparent and more orderly."It is unclear how far China will go to fulfill its pledges. Previous U.S. administrations have hailed market-opening promises only to be left disappointed.Before arriving in China, Trump had delivered a stern message to Beijing, using an address in South Korea to call on China, North Korea\'s biggest trade partner, to do more to confront and isolate the North.Trump on Thursday appeared far more conciliatory, thanking China for its efforts and saying he\'d been encouraged by his conversations."China can fix this problem easily. And quickly. And I am calling on China and your great president to hopefully work on it very hard," Trump said. "If he works on it hard it will happen."Trump also was feted at a state dinner that featured a video montage of the president\'s visit, as well as footage of his granddaughter, Arabella, the daughter of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, singing a traditional Chinese song in Mandarin.On Friday, Trump was scheduled to stop in Da Nang, Vietnam, for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference — the first of multiple summits he\'ll attend on his first trip to Asia as president.He may meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the conference. Tillerson said Thursday the two sides were still discussing whether they had "sufficient substance" to talk about in such a meeting.The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'MANILA, Philippines – President Donald Trump will formally meet his equally bombastic Philippine counterpart, Rodrigo Duterte, on the sidelines of an international summit Monday in one of the most-anticipated moments in the U.S. leader\'s first presidential trip to Asia. Both have tested the bounds of statesmanship with their foul language, devil-may-care verbal harangues against enemies and strongman tendencies.Both rose to power in an era of authoritarian, populist leaders, both have quarreled with the press and both have been condemned for making lewd remarks against women. Duterte\'s bloody campaign against illegal drugs includes widespread accusations of extrajudicial killings, raising global alarm from governments and rights group yet has been praised by Trump.A sampling of what some Filipinos think of their meeting:"These two presidents both have brusque personalities. They are both tactless but, most likely, they will not clash because the twine of their intestines are identical, they will probably have a meeting of minds and even exchange strategies in solving problems." — Marius Daniel Garcia, a 34-year-old hotel guard in Manila.___"The entertainment value is huge but in terms of policy impact, I would have to say, minimal ... Trump doesn\'t have a clear Asia policy yet. It seems to be developing. Right now, they seem to be more concerned with just giving a reassurance to Asia that they are not leaving, that\'s all.

So, Duterte, in many ways, also talks about, you know, \'make Philippines great again\'.

Security Council resolutions and for it to take steps to return to denuclearizatoin talks."We reaffirmed the importance of peace and security in the region and reiterated support for the complete, verifiable and irreversible (denuclearization) of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner," the EAS statement said.Trump attended the ASEAN summit in Manila, the last stop on his five-nation Asia swing, but skipped the expanded gathering with other leaders at the East Asia Summit, where he was represented by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.Ahead of the ASEAN and EAS summits in Manila, the Trump administration lobbied for more joint punitive actions against Pyongyang, including diplomatic sanctions. China, which is also an influential EAS member, however, has called for dialogue with North Korea and urged the U.S. to tone down its rhetoric.In August, Tillerson met his Australian and Japanese counterparts on the sidelines of an annual ASEAN ministerial meeting in Manila where they "condemned in the strongest terms North Korea\'s unlawful pursuit of a nuclear weapons program and unprecedented ballistic missile activity since last year," citing Pyongyang\'s launching of intercontinental ballistic missiles on July 4 and July 28.Trump announced Monday that the U.S. is putting North Korea\'s "murderous regime" on America\'s terrorism blacklist, saying the designation as a state sponsor of terror is long overdue. He promised a new wave of sanctions as part of a "maximum pressure campaign" over North Korea\'s development of nuclear weapons.The North had been designated as such for two decades until 2008, when it was removed in a bid to salvage international talks aimed at halting its nuclear efforts. The talks collapsed soon after.The Trump administration has been pushing foreign countries to reduce economic, diplomatic and other ties to Pyongyang in an effort to further isolate the country and bring it back to the negotiating table.___Associated Press writer Teresa Cerojano contributed to this report.', 'LONDON – The mayor of London has added his voice to calls for President Donald Trump\'s state visit to Britain to be canceled over his retweets of a British far-right group.Sadiq Khan says Trump has promoted "a vile, extremist group" and an official visit by him to Britain "would not be welcomed."Trump\'s retweeting of anti-Muslim videos from far-right group Britain First has been widely condemned in Britain. Prime Minister Theresa May\'s official spokesman said the president was wrong to have done it.In response, Trump urged May to focus on "the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom," rather than on him.Downing St. and the White House both say a state visit by Trump is planned, but no date has been set.', 'Keith Schiller, Trump’s Ex-Bodyguard, Says He Turned Down Offer of Women in Moscow - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump’s longtime bodyguard told congressional investigators this week that someone offered to send five women to Mr. Trump’s hotel room during a 2013 trip to Moscow for the annual Miss Universe pageant.But the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, said he quickly rejected the offer, and testified that he was not aware of Mr. Trump participating in any compromising activity on the trip, according to two people familiar with his testimony.Mr. Schiller spoke during a closed-door session with members of the House Intelligence Committee for nearly three hours on Tuesday. The panel is one of several on Capitol Hill investigating Russia’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 election.The 2013 trip is of particular interest to investigators because it provided the backdrop for one of the most salacious allegations in a dossier of opposition research compiled during the election claiming a broad conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to aid Mr. Trump’s candidacy. One memo included in the file contained an unsubstantiated account of Mr. Trump engaging with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room during that trip.Mr. Schiller, who traveled frequently with Mr. Trump, told investigators that he knew of no such activity during the trip.The offer for women came at a morning business meeting at the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow to discuss the pageant, which was being produced by a company owned by Mr. Trump. Mr. Schiller told investigators that about 15 people had been present for the meeting, including Emin Agalarov, a Russian pop star, and his father, Aras Agalarov, a business tycoon linked to the Kremlin.As Mr. Schiller sat in the back of the room, a man with a foreign accent unknown to him approached the bodyguard with the offer, he said. Mr. Schiller testified he did not treat it seriously and quickly said no thanks, according to one of the people familiar with the testimony, who requested anonymity to discuss answers that had been given behind closed doors.Mr. Schiller said he relayed the story to Mr. Trump when they were returning to his hotel room later that night. The men shared a laugh, he said.Mr. Schiller told investigators that he stood guard outside Mr. Trump’s door after he retired for the night, before eventually leaving to go to sleep himself, the person said.Details of Mr. Schiller’s testimony were earlier reported by NBC News.Stuart A. Sears, a lawyer representing Mr. Schiller, declined to comment.Scott Balber, a lawyer for Emin and Aras Agalarov, said the men were not aware that any such offer had been made to Mr. Schiller.“It is the case that my clients certainly were not involved in that and certainly are not aware that it happened,” Mr. Balber said.A former New York Police Department officer, Mr. Schiller has worked for Mr. Trump since the early 2000s, when he was hired as the head of security at Trump Tower in Manhattan. He accompanied Mr. Trump on business trips and later, crisscrossed the country with him during the presidential race. After Mr. Trump won the presidency, Mr. Schiller followed him into the White House, serving until September as the director of Oval Office operations.Though they spent considerable time asking about the Moscow trip, committee members also queried Mr. Schiller widely about his work with Mr. Trump, asking for details like where he worked in Trump Tower, how he communicated with Mr. Trump and whether he was ever asked by Mr. Trump for advice, according to a Republican official involved in the investigation.', 'SEOUL, South Korea – South Korean police were on high alert in Seoul on Tuesday to monitor protests by both critics and supporters of President Donald Trump as the U.S. leader arrived in the country amid concerns over North Korea\'s nuclear threats.Under the close watch of police, dozens of anti-Trump protesters rallied near the presidential office, holding signs that read "Trump, NOT welcomed!" and "Say no to Trump, say no to war."The demonstrators accused the outspoken president of raising animosity with North Korea and pressuring Seoul to buy more U.S. weapons. They also accused him of pressing Seoul to re-do a bilateral free trade deal between the countries so that it\'s more favorable to the United States."We oppose the visit to South Korea by Trump, who has heightened the fears of war on the Korean Peninsula," said one of the protesters, reading off a released statement. The group, which calls itself the "No Trump Coalition," also plans to protest on Wednesday near Seoul\'s parliament, where Trump plans to make a speech calling on the international community to maximize pressure on North Korea.Trump\'s supporters, many of them conservative older South Koreans, were also planning rallies in nearby streets, reflecting a public deeply divided along ideological and generational lines.More than 15,000 officers will be deployed to provide security during Trump\'s visit and monitor the demonstrations, according to the National Police Agency. Scores of officers in fluorescent green jackets were seen patrolling near the presidential office and U.S. Embassy, while hundreds of buses were used to create tight perimeters in nearby streets.Officers installed steel fences at a large boulevard across the embassy where a protest zone was set. Police had unsuccessfully attempted to block anti-Trump protesters from marching in streets near the presidential palace, with the Seoul Administrative Court ruling that such a ban would infringe on the protesters\' freedom of assembly.Pro- and anti-Trump protesters have been staging dueling but peaceful protests in Seoul in recent weeks ahead of Trump\'s visit. Many South Koreans are concerned that Trump\'s fiery rhetoric on North Korea, which has included threats of military options, is raising the risk of an unwanted war on the Korean Peninsula that could cost thousands of South Korean lives.Others, including older people who tend to be more conservative, are supportive of Trump\'s tough stance against the North, which has been accelerating its nuclear weapons and missile tests in recent months, and accuse liberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in of being too soft on Pyongyang.The conservative Korea Freedom Federation released a statement welcoming Trump\'s visit, which it described as a "God-like move" that would "instantly reverse" the security situation on the peninsula after the allies had been forced to the "defensive" by North Korea\'s weapons tests. However, the group also lamented Trump\'s decision not to visit the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the Koreas during his visit to the South, saying that it might lead North Korea to misjudge that its provocations have hurt the allies\' morale.Meanwhile, in the Philippines, dozens of protesters burned a portrait of Trump in downtown Manila on Tuesday, saying the president, who will join a summit of East Asian leaders next week in the country, is not welcome there. Members of Kadamay, an alliance of urban poor activists, camped out at a bridge near the presidential palace and chanted "Ban Trump in the Philippines!"___Associated Press writer Teresa Cerojano in Manila, Philippines, contributed to this report.', 'WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. and China agree that North Korea cannot just freeze its nuclear weapons program in exchange for concessions and that it must eliminate its arsenal.Trump was restating a long-standing U.S. position but suggested that China now concurred with Washington that a "freeze-for-freeze" agreement was unacceptable.China and Russia have proposed that as a way to restart long-stalled negotiations: that the North could freeze its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for the U.S. and its close ally South Korea stopping regular military drills that Pyongyang considers as preparation for invasion.China has not made a public disavowal of the proposal. China said Wednesday that it would send a high-level special envoy to North Korea amid an extended chill in relations between the neighbors.Trump was speaking a day after he returned from a 12-day trip through Asia that included a state visit to China, where he was hosted by President Xi Jinping."President Xi recognizes that a nuclear North Korea is a grave threat to China, and we agreed that we would not accept a so-called freeze for freeze agreement, like those that have consistently failed in the past," Trump said.He said that Xi pledged to implement U.N. sanctions that aim to deprive North Korea of revenues for its weapons programs "and to use his great economic influence over the regime to achieve our common goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula."China is North Korea\'s traditional ally and accounts for about 90 percent of the isolated nation\'s external trade — including virtually all its oil supplies.Speaking at the White House, Trump cast his Asian sojourn as a "tremendous success," saying the United States was feted by foreign leaders and asserted its strength in the world."America\'s renewed confidence and standing in the world has never been stronger than it is right now," Trump said, detailing his stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.Trump said he had three goals on the trip: to unite the world against North Korea\'s nuclear ambitions, to strengthen alliances in the region and to insist on "fair and reciprocal trade."Trump pledged to work "as fast as possible" to eliminate sizable trade deficits with U.S. trading partners. He said it was "unacceptable" that the U.S. trade deficit with other nations stands at about $800 billion a year and promised to "start whittling that down as fast as possible." He did not say how he planned to achieve that goal.Earlier, Trump used social media to spar with media coverage of his trip.He tweeted criticism at The New York Times. He said the paper "hates" that he has good relationships with world leaders and "they should realize that these relationships are a good thing, not a bad thing." He called the paper "naive (or dumb)" on foreign policy.The president also tweeted Wednesday that he was "forced" to watch CNN during the trip and "again realized how bad, and FAKE, it is."___Associated Press writer Catherine Lucey contributed to this report.', 'Kurt Andersen on Channeling President Trump - The New York TimesSubscribe: iTunes | Google Play MusicKurt Andersen brought a lot of experience to “You Can’t Spell America Without Me,” his new satire about President Donald J.

The booming stock market speaks for itself. President Trump has our economy rolling and now the Senate comes along with "business as usual" tactics to mess things up. Free-market lovers will never stand for this!The version of tax reform legislation unveiled by Senate Republicans on Thursday is another indication that the swamp is alive and well. This is a repeat performance of the failure of Congress to get health care done. The Senate GOP has proposed a version of the tax bill that delays the corporate tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 20 percent until 2019 – contrary to the version supported by House Republicans that would create that desperately needed economic stimulus tax rate cut in 2018.Effectively, the Senate tax bill calls for a slightly lower top tax rate for individuals of 38.5 percent, versus the 39.6 percent in the House bill. The Senate measure also would double the estate tax exemption, but not repeal the tax, as House Republicans proposed.The Senate version keeps the deduction for medical expenses, while the House bill eliminates it.The duration of real estate depreciation will be reduced from 39 years to 25 years. This initiative alone will create another real estate asset bubble like the 1980s, where the rush to invest in real estate was not matched with economic demand. This in turn created a supply-side bubble – not enough tenants to fill the buildings and a subsequent mortgage default, followed by the savings and loan crisis.The scoring of the proposed Senate tax bill shows this will cost the federal government $5.8 trillion in reduced revenue over 10 years, adding to the national debt.The controversy surrounding the blue states state and local tax deduction is also eliminated entirely in the Senate bill. This is contrary to the deal the House put forth after bending to pressure from Republicans from New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California, who raised concerns about losing that deduction for their constituents.Once again, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., capitulated to the needs of a few American taxpayers. Once again, the special interests win, not the American voter.The inability of Republicans in Congress to come to a consensus on a tax bill is reflective of their “repeal and replace” fail during the healthcare bill negotiations.The increasing pressure to deliver a bill the President Trump can sign illustrates just how purposeful Congress is at enabling gridlock. Congress fails to understand that the voter is engaged and is already mobilizing and supporting candidates for the 2018 election cycle who support the president’s agenda.Another failure to deliver a bill that President Trump campaigned for will only result in support for Steve Bannon’s rallying cry for a war on the GOP establishment.President Trump has done an amazing job of growing our economy. Americans were promised cuts that will stimulate economy, tax simplification (the Senate bill is seven layers high!), and equality (the bracketed differences are socialist, not free market!).My guess is that those who fought so hard to elect President Trump will NOT let the swamp get away with this!Dr. Gina Loudon is a frequent commentator on the interplay of psychology and politics on FOX News properties.

Mr. Trump’s two most recent predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, both made a point of avoiding public messages that were likely to be seen as anti-Muslim and could exacerbate racial and religious animosities, arguing that the war against terrorism was not a war against Islam.But Mr. Trump has shown little such restraint, targeting Muslims with a broad brush, including when he claimed on the  campaign trail last year that “Islam hates us” and when he called for a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslims coming to the United States. Since taking office, he has sought to block visitors from select Muslim-majority nations and engaged in a long-distance feud with the Muslim mayor of London, whom he branded weak on terrorism.The messages came at a time when Mr. Trump has been lashing out at an array of perceived adversaries, including the National Football League, CNN, NBC and Democratic leaders. He referred to a senator as “Pocahontas” this week in front of Navajo veterans he was honoring. In a meandering speech in St. Charles, Mo., on Wednesday, Mr. Trump labeled North Korea’s leader a “sick puppy,” asserted that welfare recipients lived better than some people with jobs, noted that his wealthy friends “love their children” and insisted that he did not like some bankers even though he was making their job “easy for them.”Mr. Trump’s unbridled talk of Muslim violence thrilled some conservative supporters who see him as a truthteller breaking from the shackles of political correctness, but it alarmed mainstream political leaders in the United States and Britain, who deemed it reckless and counterproductive.Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who has broken with Mr. Trump, called the postings “highly inappropriate” and added, “I hope he takes them down and doesn’t do it again.”Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who lately has been an ally of the president, said Mr. Trump was “legitimizing religious bigotry” with the Twitter posts. “We need Muslim allies in the war on terror,” he said. “I can only imagine how some of our Muslim allies must feel when the president gives legitimacy to it.”The reaction was sharp in London, where Prime Minister Theresa May, the leader of the Conservative Party, denounced the president for sharing material posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, the ultranationalist group. “It is wrong for the president to have done this,” Mrs. May’s office said in a statement. “Britain First seeks to divide communities by their use of hateful narratives that peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people.”David Lammy, a Labour Party member of Parliament, echoed that on Twitter. “Trump sharing Britain First,” he wrote. “Let that sink in. The President of the United States is promoting a fascist, racist, extremist hate group whose leaders have been arrested and convicted. He is no ally or friend of ours.”Late in the day, Mr. Trump pushed back against the prime minister. “Theresa,” he wrote on Twitter, initially getting her handle wrong, “don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.”Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, defended the president’s tweets, saying he was talking about the need for national security and military spending.“The threat is real,”  she told reporters. “The threat needs to be addressed. The threat has to be talked about, and that’s what the president is doing in bringing that up.”Some activists on the right expressed appreciation for the blunt talk about the threat from Islamic extremists. “It’s a pretty major undercurrent for all of American politics since 2001, as it should be,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates less immigration. “That’s not news. He just expresses that stuff in the most unfiltered, guy-ranting-in-the-bar” way.The first video distributed by Mr. Trump to his nearly 44 million followers on Wednesday showed a teenage boy attacking another and was presented as footage of a “Muslim migrant” beating a Dutch boy.But according to local officials, both boys are Dutch. The clip was taken in Monnickendam, a small town in the North Holland province of the Netherlands, in May and shows a teenager punching and kicking another boy holding a crutch. Marleen van Fessem, a spokeswoman for the local public prosecutor’s office, confirmed the 16-year-old boy who was arrested after the video came to light was “born and raised in the Netherlands.”The Embassy of the Netherlands in Washington then chided Mr. Trump. “Facts do matter,” it replied to the president on Twitter.The two additional videos were taken in 2013, one in Syria, the other in Egypt, and are provided with no explanation of the political turmoil taking place in those countries at the time, and with no details on the extremist affiliations of one of the men in the video.The president’s decision to share them was in keeping with his habit of disseminating information he has not verified even as he attacks news organizations for producing “fake news.” Two White House aides, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Mr. Trump found the videos himself. Aides said they believed he spotted one on the Twitter feed of Ann Coulter, the conservative commentator.In an email later in the day, Ms. Coulter said that while she was still “annoyed” that Mr. Trump had not yet built the border wall he promised, “I LOVE the president’s tweets!” Responding to the British criticism, she said, “Maybe between blathering about the values of ‘tolerance and respect,’ poor Theresa May might want to ask herself whether the Muslims the U.K. is importing at breakneck speed share these ‘values of tolerance and respect.’”Britain First was partly founded in 2011 by James Dowson, a far-right activist who left the group in 2014 and supported Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. The organization calls itself a “patriotic” political party, but has been criticized by human rights activists as an extremist group that seeks to bait Muslims.Ms. Fransen, who has previously been charged in Britain with “religious aggravated harassment,” thanked Mr. Trump for promoting her message. “I’m facing prison for criticising Islam,” she wrote on Twitter. “Britain is now Sharia compliant. I need your help!”In the United States, Mr. Trump’s tweets were welcomed by a former Ku Klux Klan leader, David Duke, who wrote on Twitter: “Thank God for Trump! That’s why we love him!”But they undercut efforts by Mr. Trump’s own administration to dispel the impression that he is anti-Muslim. Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, had expressed hope that his success at building alliances with leaders from Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations in recent months had put that perception behind them, according to White House officials.James K. Glassman, who as under secretary of state under Mr. Bush was charged with promoting American ideals around the world, said Mr. Trump was “simply playing into the hands of terrorists.”“New recruits are attracted not by some phony version of Islam,” he said, “but by adolescent fantasies of sado-masochism and power and by the idea of being part of a global conflict that’s transfixed and frightened the rest of the world. The president’s retweet just reinforces the narrative. Not good.”Craig M. Considine, a lecturer at Rice University and the author of several books on Muslims in the West, called the tweets an effort to stir up intolerance of Muslims in Western countries and build a case for driving them out. “He’s playing on this fear, whipping up the fear,” Mr. Considine said. “It is completely reckless.”', 'Economist Stephen Leeb shares his take.DANANG, Vietnam – In a major breakthrough, trade ministers from 11 Pacific Rim countries said they reached a deal Saturday to proceed with the free-trade Trans-Pacific Partnership deal that was in doubt after President Donald Trump abandoned it. A statement issued in the early hours Saturday said an accord was reached on "core elements" of the 11-member pact. The compromise was delayed by last-minute disagreements that prevented the TPP leaders from meeting to endorse a plan on Friday. "Ministers are pleased to announce that they have agreed on the core elements of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership," the 11 nations said in a statement. It said that the ministers maintained "the high standards, overall balance and integrity of the TPP while ensuring the commercial and other interests of all participants and preserving our inherent right to regulate, including the flexibility of the parties to set legislative and regulatory priorities." In January, Trump pulled out of the deal that was championed by his predecessor Barack Obama. Leaders of the 11 countries remaining in the TPP had been due to meet and endorse a deal worked out in last-minute talks overnight. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said earlier Friday that the 11 leaders had to postpone their meeting on the sidelines of the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Danang, Vietnam. Abe spoke after meeting with Canadian Prime Ministers Justin Trudeau, who had said days earlier that Canada would not be rushed into an agreement. The TPP member countries are trying to find a way forward without the U.S., the biggest economy and, before Trump took office, one of its most assertive supporters. Trump has said he prefers country-to-country deals and is seeking to renegotiate several major trade agreements to, as he says, "put America first." Trump reiterated his markedly different stance on trade before the 21-member APEC summit convened late Friday with a gala banquet. The U.S. president told an APEC business conference that "we are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore." He lambasted the World Trade Organization and other trade forums as unfair to the United States and reiterated his preference for bilateral trade deals, saying "I am always going to put America first." Trump said he would not enter into large trade agreements, alluding to U.S. involvement in the North American Free Trade Agreement and the TPP. In contrast, Chinese President Xi Jinping told the same group that nations need to stay committed to economic openness or risk being left behind. The Chinese president drew loud applause when he urged support for the "multilateral trading regime" and progress toward a free-trade zone in the Asia-Pacific. China is not part of the TPP. APEC operates by consensus and customarily issues nonbinding statements. TPP commitments would eventually be ratified and enforced by its members. But even talks this week on a declaration to cap the APEC summit had to be extended for an extra half day as ministers haggled over wording. It\'s unclear what the exact sticking points were, but officials have alluded to differences over the unequal impact more open trade has had on workers and concerns over automation in manufacturing that could leave many millions in a wide array of industries with no work to do. As a developing country with a fast-growing export sector, this year\'s host country, Vietnam, has a strong interest in open trade and access for its exports to consumers in the West. The summit is an occasion for its leaders to showcase the progress its economy has made thanks largely to foreign investment and trade. Danang, Vietnam\'s third largest city, is in the midst of a construction boom as dozens of resorts and smaller hotels pop up along its scenic coastline. APEC\'s members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam.', "Fox News military analyst Oliver North reacts on 'Fox & Friends.'Amid rising nuclear tensions with North Korea and concern over the potential for war, the top U.S. nuclear commander said on Saturday that he would resist President Donald Trump if he ordered an “illegal” launch of nuclear weapons. Air Force General John Hyten, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), told an audience at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, Canada that he had thought a lot about what to say if he received such an order.“I think some people think we’re stupid,” Hyten said in response to a question about such a scenario, reports Reuters. “We’re not stupid people. We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?”Hyten, who is responsible for overseeing the U.S. nuclear arsenal, detailed the process that would follow such a command.As head of STRATCOM “I provide advice to the president, he will tell me what to do,” he said in his remarks, which were retransmitted in a video posted on the forum’s Facebook page.“And if it’s illegal, guess what’s going to happen? I‘m going to say, ‘Mr. President, that’s illegal.’ And guess what he’s going to do? He’s going to say, ‘What would be legal?’ And we’ll come up with options, of a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that’s the way it works. It’s not that complicated.”Hyten said running through scenarios of how to react in the event of an illegal order was standard practice, and added: “If you execute an unlawful order, you will go to jail. You could go to jail for the rest of your life.”The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Hyten’s remarks.The general’s comments came after U.S. lawmakers, including some Republicans, expressing concern about Trump’s authority to wage war using nuclear weapons.Trump has traded insults with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and threatened in his maiden United Nations address to “totally destroy” the country of 26 million people if it threatened America.Some senators want legislation to alter the nuclear authority of the U.S. president and a Senate committee on Tuesday held the first congressional hearing in more than four decades on the president’s authority to launch a nuclear strike.", 'AMMAN, Jordan – Britain\'s prime minister is holding talks with a key pro-Western Arab ally, as she is embroiled in a row with President Donald Trump over his perceived stoking of anti-Islam sentiments.Theresa May was meeting on Thursday with Jordan\'s King Abdullah II at the end of a Mideast tour meant to bolster ties with the region before Britain leaves the European Union.The king champions religious tolerance and is a key partner in the battle against Islamic militants.Trump sparked outrage Wednesday when he retweeted inflammatory videos from a fringe British group purporting to show violence by Muslims.May\'s office rebuked Trump, saying he was "wrong" to have done so. Trump countered that May should instead "focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom."', 'China Has Donald Trump Just Where It Wants Him - The New York TimesYANGON, Myanmar — President Trump is incidental to China’s ambitions, a mere blip on a 33-year plan.

By 2035 China will be a “global leader in innovation,” showing “solid progress” toward “prosperity for everyone.” By 2050, China will be a “global leader in terms of composite national strength” and a “great, modern socialist country.”Xi gave Trump a warm welcome this week, said the Pacific was big enough for both nations and offered business agreements. Trump made nice and suggested that China and the United States could solve “almost all” of the world’s problems, “and probably all of them.” This was the noise. The real story is growing Chinese strength, steady Chinese purpose aimed at midcentury dominance and erratic American outbursts suggestive of a petulant great power’s retreat.China is busy. It has the reserves, the surpluses and the growth to shape the world. More important, it has the pride and the confidence to think long term. America First, Trump’s ugly slogan, reeks of retrenchment. By contrast, Xi’s One Belt, One Road initiative is an enormous infrastructure project designed to use Chinese money and technology to reconnect the old Silk Road and tie nations to China. In scope and value it dwarfs the Marshall Plan, the postwar reconstruction program for Europe that was a farsighted expression of American confidence almost 70 years ago.Xi’s speech to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China marked his apotheosis. He has joined the pantheon along with Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. His thought is now dogma. His China has entered a different phase. Having grown independent and then rich, it is now “becoming strong.”To what end will the strength be used? China, Xi said, “offers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.” A new era has begun “that sees China moving closer to center stage.”There could scarcely be a more explicit offer of China as an alternative, single-party, authoritarian model to the liberal democratic system of the United States (of which Trump has been such a feeble advocate). China is now “actively pursuing almost an ideological competition with the United States,” said Yun Sun, a senior associate at the Stimson Center. Xi’s speech was “a declaration of the Chinese saying that we have won this game, we are winning this game.”They are, for now. The Chinese gambit — in the past, China has been reticent about offering itself as a global paradigm — comes at a moment of American democratic fracture. It’s a good moment for Beijing to talk of arriving “center stage.” Trump does not really have ideas. He has impulses (like his dangerous infatuation with Saudi Arabia).On his Asian swing, the president spoke of pursuing a “free and open Indo-Pacific region” built around democracies including India, Japan and Australia. This was the right thing to say to counter China. Hundreds of millions of Asians outside China don’t want to find themselves obliged to study Xi Jinping Thought. They prefer liberalism to Leninism.Xi Jinping Thought calls for building the Chinese military into “world-class forces that obey the party’s command, can fight and win.” It portrays the leadership of the Communist Party as “the defining feature” of Chinese society.So Trump’s commitment to Indo-Pacific freedom is significant. It’s also dubious. Trump likes surpluses, hates deficits. It’s not clear whether any Trump strategy can get beyond such zero-sum rabble-rousing.Around Asia, the last thing countries want is to have to choose between China and the United States. From Singapore to Myanmar, they know that America is the only possible balance to China. If China is money and investment, the United States is security and freedom. The Chinese-American relationship is what the regional order depends on.Those Chinese targets for 2035 and 2050 presuppose one essential thing: regional stability. That’s the headline, not Trump’s machinations. A second Korean War would be a nuclear war. This is the last thing China wants.The second-to-last thing is the end of the North Korean regime and a united Korean Peninsula at its border, allied to the United States. China’s rise to dominance is predicated on stability until that dominance is achieved. Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, must be managed in this context.Therefore, China will try to squeeze Kim, not to the point of denuclearization (let alone collapse) but to the point where he does not further provoke the United States or Japan. The question is whether Kim is controllable.The other question is whether Trump is controllable. Xi projects the image of a reliable partner committed to an open, stable trading system. Trump, meanwhile, goes on walkabout with the Saudis.For now, a conventional Saudi-backed war in Lebanon against Iranian-backed Hezbollah is more likely than nuclear war with Pyongyang. These things happen when an America-First American president can’t think beyond next week (or money).', 'BEIJING – The Latest on President Donald Trump\'s trip to Asia (all times local):5:30 p.m.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says that when it comes to making progress on trade discussions with China, the accomplishments so far are "pretty small."Tillerson spoke to reporters as Trump was wrapping up his second and final day in China.

Trump began revisiting one of his deepest public humiliations: the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape of him making vulgar comments about women.Despite his public acknowledgment of the recording’s authenticity in the final days of the presidential campaign — and his hasty videotaped apology under pressure from his advisers — Mr. Trump as president-elect began raising the prospect with allies that it may not have been him on the tape after all.Most of Mr. Trump’s aides ignored his changing story. But in January, shortly before his inauguration, Mr. Trump told a Republican senator that he wanted to investigate the recording that had him boasting about grabbing women’s genitals.“We don’t think that was my voice,” Mr. Trump told the senator, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Since then, Mr. Trump has continued to suggest that the tape that nearly upended his campaign was not actually him, according to three people close to the president.As the issue of sexual harassment has swept through the news media, politics and entertainment industries, Mr. Trump has persisted in denying allegations that he, too, made unwanted advances on multiple women in past years. In recent days, he has continued to seed doubt about his appearance on the “Access Hollywood” tape, stunning his advisers.More generally, Mr. Trump’s views on the issue have changed depending upon the political party involved. He has praised women for coming forward after accusations were made against a Democrat, Senator Al Franken of Minnesota. But in the case of Roy S. Moore, a Republican candidate for Senate from Alabama, Mr. Trump has said he believes Mr. Moore’s denials that he behaved inappropriately with teenage girls, and he has effectively endorsed Mr. Moore’s candidacy.Mr. Trump’s falsehoods about the “Access Hollywood” tape are part of his lifelong habit of attempting to create and sell his own version of reality. Advisers say he continues to privately harbor a handful of conspiracy theories that have no grounding in fact.In recent months, they say, Mr. Trump has used closed-door conversations to question the authenticity of President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. He has also repeatedly claimed that he lost the popular vote last year because of widespread voter fraud, according to advisers and lawmakers.One senator who listened as the president revived his doubts about Mr. Obama’s birth certificate chuckled on Tuesday as he recalled the conversation. The president, he said, has had a hard time letting go of his claim that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. The senator asked not to be named to discuss private conversations.Mr. Trump’s journeys into the realm of manufactured facts have been frequent enough that his own staff has sought to nudge friendly lawmakers to ask questions of Mr. Trump in meetings that will steer him toward safer terrain.To the president’s critics, his conspiracy-mongering goes to the heart of why he poses a threat to the country.“It’s dangerous to democracy; you’ve got to have shared facts,” Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said in an interview on Tuesday. “And on so many of these, there’s empirical evidence that says no: You didn’t win the popular vote, there weren’t more people at your inauguration than ever, that was your voice on that tape, you admitted it before.”Mr. Flake, who is not running for re-election, said in the interview that he was about to begin a series of speeches on the Senate floor outlining his concerns about Mr. Trump. The first, he said, will be dedicated to what Mr. Flake called the president’s disregard for the truth.Many Republican lawmakers — not wanting to undermine the party’s fragile negotiations over a much-sought tax overhaul — declined to talk on the record about Mr. Trump’s pattern of plunging into what one senator called “his rabbit holes.” But the president’s success last year has also left some in his party in awe of his achievement and uneasy about angering his base of supporters.“This guy got $2 billion of earned media in the primary, and he won an election that nobody thought he was going to win,” said Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, alluding to the monetary equivalent of what Mr. Trump garnered in news media coverage. “This is a guy who is doing things that are totally unprecedented.”Mr. Perdue, who like the president is a former business executive, did not defend Mr. Trump’s untruths but said that other historical figures had their flaws, too.“He’s nobody’s choir boy, but neither were people like Winston Churchill, for example,” said the senator. “This guy, I think, is a historic person of destiny at a time and place in America when we’ve got to make a right-hand turn here.” Asked if the truth still matters, Mr. Perdue said: “Oh, absolutely. Facts are what you base decisions on.”But Mr. Trump seems to not want to fully accept those facts that are embarrassing or inconvenient.In October 2016, when The Washington Post first emailed Mr. Trump’s aides about the dialogue from the “Access Hollywood” tape, Mr. Trump said the words described by the newspaper did not sound like things he would say, according to two people familiar with the discussions. However, when an aide played the audio after the newspaper posted it online, Mr. Trump, who had been preparing for his second presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, did not deny it.“It’s me,” he told people in the room as he listened. Yet after The New York Times published an article last weekend revealing that the president had questioned the authenticity of the recording, White House aides refused to answer questions about whether Mr. Trump still believes it was him on the tape.The White House declined to comment for this article, pointing instead to comments that Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, made on Monday.“He’s made his position on that clear at that time, as have the American people in his support of him,” Ms. Sanders said at the White House daily news briefing. She did not offer any direct answers when pressed further about the matter.Mr. Trump’s friends did not bother denying that the president was creating an alternative version of events. One Republican lawmaker, who asked not to be identified, said that Mr. Trump’s false statements had become familiar to people over time. The president continues to boast of winning districts that he did not in fact win, the lawmaker said, and of receiving 52 percent of the women’s vote, even though exit polls show that 42 percent of women supported him.Mr. Trump has a long history of stretching facts, predating his presidency. He has claimed his signature building, Trump Tower in Manhattan, was several stories taller than it actually is. In his first book, “The Art of the Deal,” he conceded to employing what he called “truthful hyperbole.”“I’m not a presidential historian, but I think many other presidents have written and shaped their own myths,” said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media, who spent part of Thanksgiving weekend with Mr. Trump at the president’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.“Look at what happened with John Kennedy,” Mr. Ruddy added. “If you read Theodore White’s books on it, he was given a story line about Camelot. I don’t think President Trump has gone that far — he’s not describing this as Camelot.”', '                                    Donald Trump makes a point during the CNN Republican presidential debate at the Venetian Hotel & Casino on Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2015, in Las Vegas.

His role appears to be simple, as Clapper attacks Trump on a regular basis in segments that can be replayed across CNN platforms throughout the day. Meanwhile, Obama-era CIA Director John Brennan appears to be angling for a job at the anti-Trump network, as he recently claimed to be proud when personally attacked by the president, who called him a political hack.(The Associated Press)Clapper once said Trump’s access to the nuclear codes is “pretty damn scary” and has question his “fitness to be in this office.” Clapper’s latest obsession is Trump’s recent conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which the media turned into a microcosm of its obsession over all-things Russia.Trump recently told reporters that Putin told him he “absolutely did not meddle in our election” and “he did not do what they are saying he did."“It\'s a boom market on TV for anyone who wants to take a swing at the president.”Trump was simply repeating what Putin told him, but the mainstream media quickly criticized the president for appearing to accept Putin\'s assurances. Trump was forced to clarify his remarks, saying he believes that Putin “feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election,” not that the White House actually believes him.Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor said the “easiest route to appearing on TV -- especially anti-Trump CNN” is to bash the president.“It doesn\'t matter what you will say. All that matters is the target. Everything else you have done, everything that might discredit you will likely be downplayed or forgotten,” Gainor told Fox News. “It\'s a boom market on TV for anyone who wants to take a swing at the president.”Trump eventually blasted former intelligence officials who have attempted to dissect every syllable of his comments about Putin, calling them “political hacks,” but Brennan took it as a compliment."He was referring to us as political hacks because he was trying to delegitimize the intelligence community assessment," Brennan said. "Considering the source of the criticism, I consider that criticism a badge of honor.”Clapper and Brennan appeared together Sunday on CNN"s "State of the Union" for a 16-minute interview seemingly designed to fire up anyone who thinks Russia’s alleged election interference isn’t in the news enough these days. Clapper and Brennan told host Jake Tapper that Russians don’t have good intentions when it comes to the United States and essentially mocked Trump because he didn’t publically call Putin a liar.(The Associated Press)"The threat posed by Russia, as John just said, is manifest and obvious. To try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding, and in fact, poses a peril to this country,” Brennan said.Clapper claimed that the Chinese and Russians think they can “play” Trump, while Brennan complained that Trump would attack his critics on Veteran’s Day and even said the president is “intimidated” by Putin. Clips from the "State of the Union" interview were replayed throughout the day on CNN and are embedded in a variety of the network’s digital content.CNN is clearly proud of its ability to get former intelligence chiefs to criticize the president, as the network’s website featured two headlines -- leading the homepage political section – with quotes from Clapper and Brennan nearly 24 hours after the joint interview.Brian Flood covers the media for Fox News.

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was caught on a hot mic Friday telling a Republican mayor that "if we become the party of Roy Moore and Donald Trump, we are toast."Flake made the comment to Mesa, Ariz. Mayor John Giles following a town hall event at which Giles had asked Flake about the possibility of running for president in 2020."Can we start the presidential campaign today?" Giles asked Flake during the event, to scattered laughter from the audience.Flake, who announced last month he would not run for re-election to the Senate in 2018, made the "toast" comment to Giles after the event had ended. It was picked up by his lapel mic and recorded by Phoenix TV station ABC15.In response, Giles told Flake, "I am not throwing smoke at you but ... think how much fun it would be just to be the foil, you know, and to point out what an idiot this guy is," apparently referring to Trump."Anyway," Giles added, "hope you do it."No news here. I\'ve been saying this to anyone who will listen https://t.co/50klmeSm5aFlake, a longtime critic of the president, shrugged off the remark Saturday afternoon, tweeting "No news here. I\'ve been saying this to anyone who will listen."In a Senate floor speech announcing that he would not seek a second term, Flake criticized Trump for engaging in "reckless, outrageous, and undignified behavior." He also accused the Republican Party of having ""given in or given up on the core principles in favor of a more viscerally satisfying anger and resentment ... but anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy."Flake has also been unsparing in his criticism of Moore, the Republican candidate in next month\'s Alabama Senate special election.On Monday, after several women came forward to allege sexual misconduct by Moore, Flake said he would "run to the polling place" to support Democrat Doug Jones if he was an Alabama voter. Flake also said that he would vote to expel Moore from the Senate should the Republican candidate win the Dec. 12 election.Flake has also criticized Moore in the past for stating that Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., should not be seated in Congress because Ellison is a Muslim."When a judge expressed his personal belief that a Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith, it was wrong," Flake said last month. "That this same judge is now my party’s nominee for the Senate should concern us all. Religious tests have no place in the United States Congress."In response, Moore campaign adviser Brett Doster described Flake and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as "agents of destruction within the Republican Party."They assassinate conservatives like Roy Moore so they can work with the liberal elite to protect their big government trough," Doster told Fox News late Saturday. "The people are tired of being told they are ignorant for demanding reform, and that’s why they will elect Roy Moore in 3 weeks."Fox News\' Dan Gallo contributed to this report.', 'MANILA, Philippines – President Donald Trump has offered to mediate in South China Sea disputes and his Chinese counterpart played down concerns over Beijing\'s military buildup and the prospects of war in the contested waters.Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke separately about the territorial rifts ahead of an annual summit of Southeast Asian nations and the U.S., China and other global players in Manila, where the disputes are high on the agenda.Trump says "I\'m a very good mediator," but his offer faces many obstacles: for one, China doesn\'t want the U.S. meddling in the disputes and has balked at the U.S. Navy\'s incursions into what Beijing considers its territorial waters in the South China Sea.Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte says Xi assured him of China\'s peaceful intentions.', 'MADRID – Former Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa has called on his successor Lenin Moreno to explain to his country why he met with the indicted former campaign chairman for U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this year."If they keep it secret it\'s because they are hiding something," Correa said in an interview Saturday with The Associated Press in Madrid.Paul Manafort was recently indicted in the U.S. on money laundering charges and other counts and went to Ecuador May 9, according to a U.S. court filing.Moreno\'s office declined to comment when contacted by the AP.Correa said he was not aware of the May trip and only found out about it in the press some days ago.

Another Labour legislator, Chuka Umunna, said Trump\'s invitation to visit Britain "should be withdrawn."Prime Minister Theresa May announced in January that Trump had accepted an invitation for a state visit to Britain. Almost a year later, no date has been set, and opponents of Trump have vowed to stage large protests if he does come.Founded in 2011, Britain First opposes multiculturalism and what it calls the "Islamization" of Britain. Small but publicity-savvy, it has staged direct-action protests at mosques and is active on social media. The group regularly posts inflammatory videos purporting to show violence by Muslims, without context or supporting information.Fransen, 31, was convicted last year of religiously aggravated harassment after hurling abuse at a Muslim woman wearing a hijab. She currently faces four other counts of harassment and a separate charge of hate speech.Trump\'s retweets were a major publicity boost for the group, whose own Twitter account is followed by about 24,000 others.Fransen tweeted "God bless you Trump! God bless America!" in capital letters to her followers, whose number grew by several thousand to about 60,000 in the hours after the boost from the president.British authorities have warned about a growing threat from violent far-right extremism, and recently charged the leader of another white supremacist group with plotting to kill a lawmaker.In June 2016 Labour lawmaker Jo Cox was shot and stabbed to death by Thomas Mair, who shouted "Britain first" as he attacked her.The legislator\'s widower, Brendan Cox, tweeted Wednesday: "Spreading hatred has consequences & the President should be ashamed of himself."London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a Muslim who has been the target of inaccurate criticism by Trump about his supposedly lax approach to extremist violence, also criticized the president."Britain First is a vile, hate-fuelled organization whose views should be condemned, not amplified," Khan said.', 'JERUSALEM – The Latest on President Donald Trump\'s expected recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital on Wednesday (all times local):9:40 a.m.Turkey\'s prime minister says President Donald Trump\'s expected recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital will make the region\'s problems "unresolvable."U.S. officials have told The Associated Press the announcement would come on Wednesday and would include instructions for the State Department to begin moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.Prime Minister Binali Yildirim spoke about the possibility at a news conference with South Korean officials in Seoul.Yildirim said it was vital for the Middle Eastern region and for global peace that Trump not make such an announcement.Jerusalem is sacred to Christians, Jews and Muslims and is a contentious part of Israel-Palestinian negotiations.The prime minister said a declaration could cause religious clashes and destroy efforts toward formation of a Palestinian state.___9:15 a.m.President Donald Trump will recognize Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital despite intense Arab, Muslim and European opposition to a move that would upend decades of U.S. policy and risk potentially violent protests.U.S. officials say Trump will also instruct the State Department on Wednesday to begin the multi-year process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city.The officials said numerous logistical and security details, as well as site determination and construction, will need to be finalized first. Because of those issues, the embassy is not likely to move for at least 3 or 4 years, presuming there is no future change in U.S. policy.The U.S. officials spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity Tuesday because they were not authorized to publicly preview Trump\'s announcement.', 'John Roberts reports from Manila, PhilippinesWhen President Donald Trump met with his counterparts from Australia and Japan on Monday in Manila, two other countries were on the leaders\' minds -- China and North Korea.The meeting among the U.S. president, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signaled their growing concerns about China\'s power in the Indo-Pacific region -- and the potential threat that North Korea poses to its neighbors.Trump and Turnbull have used the five-day ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) summit in the Philippines to rally other countries to impose tougher sanctions against the rogue North Korean regime. Monday’s meeting was supposed to be bilateral, but it was altered at the last minute to include the Japanese leader.“We’ve got the same values and the same focus,” Turnbull said about the meeting with Trump and Abe, adding that the North Korean missile crisis dominated the conversation, according to the Australian. The prime minister said the three countries were focused on stopping North Korea’s “reckless provocation.”“Peace and stability have underpinned the prosperity of billions of people over many decades and we\'re going to work together to ensure we maintain it,” he added.Trump said progress has been made in trade talks -- a signature issue for the president, who campaigned heavily on his so-called “America First” agenda.“We’ve made some very big steps in respect to trade” as a result of meetings during his Asian trip, he told reporters.Meanwhile, Trump promised that there will be a "major statement" from the White House on Wednesday, possibly about trade and North Korea.“We have deficits with almost everybody.

The team is in charge of responding to alerts of offensive tweets, bad behavior, etc.During his last day on the job, Duysak said, someone had reported Trump’s account. So as his final act as a Twitter employee, he decided to start the process of deactivating the account before he signed off for good.Duysak said he didn’t think much of it until several hours later, when he learned what happened to the president\'s account and that a media uproar followed. Bypassing mainstream mediaTrump has consistently used Twitter to bypass the mainstream media and reach his 43.6 million followers directly, sometimes with content that some consider inflammatory.On Wednesday, Trump faced backlash for retweeting several videos that appeared to show Muslims committing acts of violence, with British Prime Minister Theresa May among the critics.However, Trump seemed to ignore the criticism telling May in a tweet “don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.”Trump’s large social media presence was a crucial tool during his presidential campaign and a platform he acknowledged played a role in his election victory, the Washington Post noted. \'Full internal review\'.@Theresa_May, don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.

Fox News\' Brooke Singman and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.', 'WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is allowing more employers to opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious or moral objections, issuing new rules Friday that take another step in rolling back the Obama health care law.Employers with religious or moral qualms will also be able to cover some birth control methods, and not others. Experts said that could interfere with efforts to promote modern long-acting implantable contraceptives, such as IUDs, which are more expensive.The new policy was a long-anticipated revision to Affordable Care Act requirements that most companies cover birth control as preventive care for women, at no additional cost. That Obama-era requirement applies to all FDA-approved methods, including the morning-after pill, which some religious conservatives call an abortion drug, though scientists say it has no effect on women who are already pregnant.As a result of the ACA, most women no longer pay for contraceptives. Several advocacy groups immediately announced plans to try to block the Trump administration rule. "We are preparing to see the government in court," said Brigitte Amiri, a senior attorney for the ACLU.Catholic bishops called the administration\'s move a "return to common sense."Trump\'s religious and moral exemption is expected to galvanize both his opponents and religious conservatives who back him, but it seems unlikely to have a major impact on America\'s largely secular workplaces."I can\'t imagine that many employers are going to be willing to certify that they have a moral objection to standard birth control methods," said Dan Mendelson, president of the consulting firm Avalere Health.That said, Mendelson said he worries the new rule will set a precedent for weakening ACA requirements that basic benefits be covered. "If you look at it as a public health issue, it is a step in the wrong direction, and it weakens the protections of the ACA," he said.Tens of thousands of women could be affected by Trump\'s policy, but the vast majority of companies have no qualms about offering birth control benefits through their health plans. Human resource managers recognize that employers get an economic benefit from helping women space out their pregnancies, since female workers are central to most enterprises.The administration estimated that some 200 employers who have already voiced objections to the Obama-era policy would qualify for the expanded opt-out, and that 120,000 women would be affected.However, it\'s unclear how major religion-affiliated employers such as Catholic hospitals and universities will respond. Many Catholic hospitals now rely on an Obama-era workaround under which the government pays for the cost of birth control coverage. That workaround can continue under the new rules.Since contraception became a covered preventive benefit, the share of women employees paying with their own money for birth control pills has plunged to 3 percent, from 21 percent, according to the latest Kaiser Family Foundation figures."It was really important for women to have a choice of the full range of contraceptive methods that were FDA-approved," said Alina Salganicoff, director of women\'s health policy for the Kaiser foundation. "This will now make it up to the employer whether or not to cover contraception, and whether to cover all methods."Salganicoff said she\'s concerned about coverage for implantable devices that are more expensive but also much more effective. "It opens up a lot of opportunities for employers to make choices about the coverage that women have right now," she said.The Trump administration\'s revision broadens a religious exemption that previously applied to houses of worship, religion-affiliated nonprofit groups and closely held private companies. Administration officials said the new policy defends religious freedom. In addition to nonprofits, privately held businesses will be able to seek an exemption on religious or moral grounds, while publicly traded companies can seek an exemption due to religious objections."No American should be forced to violate his or her own conscience in order to abide by the laws and regulations governing our health care system," Health and Human Services spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said in a statement.The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops welcomed the administration\'s decision."Such an exemption is no innovation, but instead a return to common sense, long-standing federal practice, and peaceful coexistence between church and state," Cardinal Daniel N. DiNardo, the group\'s president, said in a joint statement with Archbishop William E. Lori of Baltimore, head of its religious liberty committee.Officials also said the administration is tightening oversight of how plans sold under the health law cover abortion. With limited exceptions, abortions can only be paid for through a separate premium collected from enrollees.Doctors\' groups that were instrumental in derailing Republican plans to repeal the health law expressed their dismay.The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said the new policy could reverse progress in lowering the nation\'s rate of unintended pregnancies."HHS leaders under the current administration are focused on turning back the clock on women\'s health," said the organization\'s president, Dr. Haywood Brown.The new rules take effect right away.___Crary reported from New York.

Bob Corker, R-Tenn., on Friday appeared open to the idea of challenging President Donald Trump in the 2020 GOP primary.But while speaking to reporters at the64th annual Governor’s Conference on Economic and Community Development, Corker said it was “way, way too early" to decide whether to compete for the Republican presidential nomination, USA Today reported.“So the only thing that I’m thinking about right now over the next 14 months truly is doing the best job I can as a senator,” Corker said. “You know, I don’t know what I’m doing next Sunday.”The notion that Trump will be impeached is unrealistic, Corker said, even as some media reports speculated he was building a case for the president\'s removal from office.Corker added that he was wary of contemplating a presidential run because of how it would affect his current responsibilities."I think that if you even begin thinking those things, everything you do becomes viewed through a different lens," he said.Corker, who has announced that he will not seek a third Senate term in 2018, has long feuded with the president. After the deadly violence at protests in Charlottesville, Va., in August, Corker said that Trump had demonstrated neither the “stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful."On Oct. 8, after Trump tweeted that Corker was a “negative voice” who lacked “the guts to run” for reelection without the president’s endorsement, Corker likened the White House to an “adult day care center.” Later that day, Corker told the New York Times that Trump was setting the U.S. “on the path to World War III.” The president hit back, calling the senator a “lightweight” who "couldn\'t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee."Corker again excoriated the president Tuesday, tweeting that he was “utterly untruthful” and vowing he would not support Trump in any future campaign.But Corker acknowledged his attacks on Trump might not be endearing him to many of his constituents. In a survey conducted this month, Corker’s disapproval rating had soared to 41 percent in Tennessee, marking a 14-point increase since last spring. Meanwhile, Trump’s approval rating in the state has held steady at approximately 50 percent."We were surprised that it hadn\'t dropped further than it did," Corker said of his approval rating.The Associated Press contributed to this story.Gregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

So therefore ain\'t no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!"I received voicemails after LeBron tweeted that were some of the most vile, disgusting, racist," Gilbert told CNBC Friday. "There\'s an element of racism that I didn\'t even realize existed in this country this much." Gilbert said he had not told James about the voicemails. He called the comments unnerving. "And you could hear it in their voice -- the racism," Gilbert said. "It wasn\'t even really about the issue, and that\'s what really got me, because they went to who they really are, some of them." Earlier this week, James said he did not regret his comment about Trump. "Me and my friends call me that all the time," James said during a news conference prior to the opening of Cleveland\'s training camp. "I\'m not his friend, though. He\'s not my friend. No, when I woke up and saw what he said about Steph Curry. First of all, it\'s so funny because it\'s like you inviting me to your party, right? As a matter of fact, it\'s not like you invited me. "It\'s almost, like, \'Hey, I\'m not going to be able to make it. I\'m not coming,\' and then you would be like, \'LeBron, guess what? You\'re not invited.\' I wasn\'t coming anyways, so that was funny to me when I woke up and saw that. So, my first initial response was, you bum." James also commended NFL players for protesting after Trump said owners should fire any players who kneel during the national anthem. Gilbert and James have patched up a complicated relationship. Gilbert infamously wrote a letter to Cleveland fans criticizing James for leaving as a free agent in 2010. The owner was later fined $100,000 after he accused James of quitting in the playoffs during an interview with The Associated Press. Gilbert\'s ties to Trump would seem to create another problem. Gilbert, however, said in statement this week that he supports both political parties. Gilbert\'s Quicken Loans mortgage lending company donated $750,000 to the president\'s inauguration party. "Our interests are in the policies at the federal level, and not the politics surrounding the elections," he said. "We have often supported both political parties in the same election so that we have the ability to impact positive change, regardless of who occupies the offices.

The plan also would reduce the number of personal income tax brackets and boost the standard deduction."A family can get and a business can get ... as much as a 40% tax reduction," Trump promised. "It\'s the largest tax reduction in the history of our country."When asked if he was confident the plan would pass the Senate, Trump responded that " I can’t imagine the largest tax cut for people in our history not passing" before asking rhetorically, "I mean, who\'s going to vote against this?"The president noted that his tax plan had forced his drive to repeal and replace ObamaCare to take a backseat, but claimed "I actually think, right now, we have the votes" to pass a plan. Trump also leveled criticism at Republican senators who balked at previous ObamaCare repeal plans."Two people decide they want to do something for whatever reason, and in some cases it is grandstanding," Trump said. "Now, all of a sudden, you don’t have health care. But we’re going to get it anyway."Trump also criticized the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, calling it "one of the most incompetently drawn deals I\'ve ever seen.""They got a path to nuclear weapons very quickly and ... $1.7 billion in cash," Trump said. "You know how many airplane loads that must be? Did you ever see a million dollars, like a promotion, where they have a million dollars in $100 bills? It\'s a lot ... So, this is the worst deal. We got nothing."The president reportedly will declare Iran to be not in compliance with the nuclear agreement in a major policy address later this week.Trump also lashed out at the ongoing investigation over Russian actions during last year\'s presidential election, calling it "an excuse used by the Democrats when they lost the election.""They sat in a room and they said, \'Wow, we look bad.\' The morning after, in fact it\'s been written about in various books, or a book, but they said, \'Why did you lose the election?\'" the president said.

Russia!\' It wasn\'t Russia, it was a bad candidate."', '', 'Trump, Chieftain of Spite - The New York TimesIt must be cold and miserable standing in the shadow of someone greater and smarter, more loved and more admired. It must be infuriating to have risen on the wings of your derision of that person’s every decision, and even his very existence, and yet not be able to measure up — in either stratagem or efficacy — when you sit where that person once sat.This is the existence of Donald Trump in the wake of President Barack Obama. Trump can’t hold a candle to Obama, so he’s taking a tiki torch to Obama’s legacy. Trump can’t get his bad ideas through Congress, but he can use the power of the presidency to sabotage or even sink Obama’s signature deeds.In fact, if there is a defining feature of Trump as “president,” it is that he is in all ways the anti-Obama — not only on policy but also on matters of propriety and polish. While Obama was erudite, Trump is ignorant. Obama was civil, Trump is churlish. Obama was tactful, Trump is tacky.There is a thing present in Obama and absent from Trump that no amount of money or power can alter: a sense of elegant intellectualism and taste.The example Obama set makes the big man with the big mouth look smaller by the day. But I believe that this nonadjustable imbalance is part of what has always fueled Trump’s rage against Obama. Trump, who sees character as just another malleable thing that can be marketed and made salable, chafes at the black man who operated above the coarseness of commercial interests and whose character appeared unassailable.America — even many of the people who were staunch opponents of Obama’s policies — admired and even adored the sense of honor and decency he brought to the office. Trump, on the other hand, is historically unpopular, and not just in America. As The Pew Research Center pointed out in June: “Trump and many of his key policies are broadly unpopular around the globe, and ratings for the U.S. have declined steeply in many nations.” Trump is reviled around the globe and America’s reputation is going down with its captain.All of this feeds Trump’s consuming obsession with undoing everything Obama did. It is his personal crusade, but he also carries the flag for the millions of Americans — mostly all Republicans — who were reflexively repulsed by Obama and the coalition that elected him.Trump has done nearly everything in his power to roll back Obama’s policies, but none are as tempting a target as the one named after him: Obamacare.Republicans — including Trump — campaigned for years on a lie. They knew it was a lie, but it was an enraging one that excited their base: Obama was destroying America’s health care system, but Republicans could undo the damage and replace it with their own, better bill.First, Obama wasn’t destroying America’s health care system. To the contrary, he simply sought to make it cover more people. He moved to take American health care in a more humane, modern and civilized direction, to make it more universally accessible, even by the sick and poor who often took its absence as a given.Second, the Republicans had no replacement plan that would cost less and cover as many or more people. That could not be done. So, their repeal-and-replace efforts failed. But that also meant that Trump’s promise was proven a lie. Trump has no problem lying, but in the end he wants his lies to look plausible.Trump makes assertions for which there is no evidence — either knowingly lying, recklessly boasting or wishfully thinking — then seeks support for those statements, support that is often lacking because the statements are baseless.He violates a basic protocol of human communication: Be sure of it before you say it. His way is to say something wrong, then bend reality to make it appear right. This is why the age of Trump is so maddening and stupefying: He is warping reality.Last week he took more swipes at undermining the A.C.A.: Asking his administration to find ways to increase competition among insurers (a move many worry will move younger, healthier people out of the marketplace) and stopping the so-called “cost-sharing reduction” (CSR) payments — federal subsidies paid to insurance companies to help finance coverage for low-income Americans (a move many believe will send premiums soaring for those people).Trump is doing this even though it will likely wreak havoc on countless lives. He is doing this even though a Kaiser Health Tracking Poll released Friday found that most Americans want Trump and Congress to stop trying to repeal the law, and instead work on legislation to stabilize the marketplaces and guarantee health care to Americans.Furthermore, six in 10 Americans believe Congress should guarantee cost-sharing reduction payments, as opposed to only a third who view these payments as a “bailout of insurance companies,” as Trump has called them. There is no real reason to cut these payments, other than to save face and conceal the farce.Trump isn’t governing with a vision, he’s governing out of spite. Obama’s effectiveness highlights Trump’s ineptitude, and this incenses Trump.', 'The \'Special Report\' All-Star panel weighs in.The controversial dossier containing salacious allegations about President Donald Trump and his possible connections to Russia, including coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, resulted fromfunding by Hillary Clinton\'s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee to the firm Fusion GPS, a source familiar with the situation confirmed to Fox News.Fusion GPS was retained by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the DNC and the Clinton campaign, The Washington Post first reported Tuesday. Fusion GPS then reportedly hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to write the now-infamous dossier.Steele had ties both to the U.S. intelligence community and the FBI.Prior to the firm being retained in April 2016 by Elias and his law firm, Perkins Coie, Fusion GPS’s research had been subsidized by an unidentified Republican during the GOP primary.But the Clinton campaign – and the DNC – saw the research through, funding the firm through the end of October 2016, just days before Trump defeated Clinton in the general election, according to The Post\'s reporting.Steele’s findings and other research were then submitted to Elias via Fusion GPS, The Post reported. The method and the amount of the information that was provided to the campaign and the DNC wasn\'t immediately clear. It also wasn’t known who in those organizations knew about the roles of both Steele and Fusion GPS.Following Trump’s victory, The Post reported, the FBI arranged to pay Steele to proceed with intelligence gathering about both Trump and Russia. That deal was later nixed after the former intelligence officer was identified in news reports.Perkins Coie was paid $5.6 million in legal fees by the Clinton campaign in a time period ranging from June 2015 to December 2016, The Post reported, citing campaign finance records. The DNC also paid the firm $3.6 million for “legal and compliance consulting” going back to November 2015.Sources told The Post that neither the Clinton campaign or the DNC specifically directed Steele’s work, labeling the intelligence officer simply as a Fusion GPS subcontractor.FUSION GPS OFFICIALS TAKE THE FIFTH IN TRUMP DOSSIER INTERVIEW ON CAPITOL HILLFusion GPS has recently been in the spotlight of congressional Republicans as they\'ve tried to get the firm to reveal those who supported Steele’s work.Fusion GPS has refused to do so, citing client confidentiality agreements.Officials with the firm have also invoked their right to refuse to answer questions from the House Intelligence Committee. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., subsequently subpoenaed the firm’s bank records in order to identify the client who subsidized the dossier.Meanwhile, Glenn Simpson, the Fusion GPS founder, already gave a 10-hour interview to the Senate Judiciary Committee.TRUMP DOSSIER FIRM\'S \'SMEAR\' TACTICS UNVEILEDThe report on the dossier\'s funding come just days after the president tweeted about the controversial file.

Capitol Police later announced that Clayton was arrested and charged with “unlawful conduct.”Fox News has learned that Clayton used an outdated visitor’s pass to enter the Capitol through a tunnel connecting the Rayburn House Office building.After clearing the security checkpoint, he made his way outside the Senate chamber, where he blended in with credentialed congressional reporters and stood just feet away from Trump.“This was a failure on multiple levels,” said one senior source with knowledge of the security breach. “There is egg on people’s faces.”Authorities are now reviewing security camera footage to determine the path Clayton took to surpass security and enter the second floor by the Senate chamber. There could be discipline for the officers who didn’t detect the protester, Fox News has learned.“Some heads will roll,” added another security source. Clayton is known for expressing hisanti-Trumpviews by tossing Russia flags. At the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, he spearheaded the distribution of over 1,000 Russian flags with Trump\'s name printed across the middle.Americans Take Action is anti-Trump, with tabs on its website dedicated to his impeachment, “Trump Puppets” and options to “Get Russian Trump Flags.”Clayton spoke with congressional security officials after the incident.The disruption was reminiscent of a 2008 joint-press conference with then-President George W. Bush and then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, where an Iraqi television reporter hurled both of his shoes at Bush. Bush dodged both shoes, and later joked at the incident, saying that all he could “report” was that the shoes were “a size 10.”Fox News\' Brooke Singman, Chad Pergram, Jason Donner and Ben Florance contributed to this report. ', "South Carolina senator comments on the special counsel's investigation.Special counsel Robert Mueller’s charges against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and two other aides mark a new phase in his sprawling investigation into Russia and President Donald Trump. But the president’s supporters on Capitol Hill have said they want all the facts to come in first.There “will be holy hell to pay” if Mueller is dismissed, Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News on Monday, unconcerned about rumblings of the ongoing threat Mueller poses to the president. He said there is zero evidence from the White House that Mueller’s investigation will be stopped or curtailed.Asked to elaborate, Graham continued: “I've heard nothing from the White House to suggest that the president's going to try to replace Mr. Mueller. Zero evidence from anybody I've talked to. It would be wrong to do so unless there were cause.”People familiar with Trump’s thinking told The Associated Press the president has become increasingly concerned that the Mueller probe could be moving to an investigation into his personal dealings.“No politician should ever be afraid of the American legal system working its will,” Graham told Fox News about many of his colleagues’ refusal to comment on the case.White House officials were publicly optimistic about Mueller’s investigation wrapping up swiftly.Many lawmakers noted the U.S. government would continue as normal regardless of the indictments.The agenda of the Trump administration such as health care and tax reform shouldn’t be affected, said Senator John N. Kennedy, R-La., noting that Americans can multitask. “Most Americans do, and I don’t see why we can’t,” he told Fox News.Trump immediately sought to distance himself after Manafort and Rick Gates pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment alleging money laundering, conspiracy and other offenses. Another former aide, George Papadopoulos, was revealed to be cooperating with authorities after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI.Fox News' Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", 'Trump Belittles George Papadopoulos as ‘Low Level’ Adviser - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump on Tuesday tried to diminish the significance of a former foreign policy adviser who admitted to lying to the F.B.I. about how, during last year’s presidential campaign, he sought to meet with Russians offering “dirt” on Hillary Clinton based on purloined emails.In his first comment on this aspect of the case being developed by the special counsel investigation, Mr. Trump did not deny that the foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, worked to collaborate with Russia. He simply brushed off his significance and focused on the fact that Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. to cover up the contacts with Russia.“Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.As for the indictment of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the president repeated that the crimes alleged took place outside the context of the election contest.As he has repeatedly in recent days, Mr. Trump sought to turn attention to Democrats, pointing to the resignation of Tony Podesta, the powerhouse Democratic lobbyist who also faces scrutiny by Mr. Mueller and whose brother, John D. Podesta, was Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman.“The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm,” Mr. Trump wrote. “What he know about Crooked Dems is earth shattering. He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. Fake News weak!”Mr. Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, were charged in a 12-count indictment with a series of money laundering, tax evasion and foreign lobbying crimes stemming from work for pro-Russian political leaders in Ukraine. While the crimes alleged began years before Mr. Trump’s campaign, the indictment asserted that Mr. Manafort’s scheme to defraud continued through last year until early this year.Mr. Papadopoulos was named by Mr. Trump in March 2016 as one of five foreign policy advisers. While the president and his team now seek to minimize Mr. Papadopoulos’s importance, at the time Mr. Trump described him in flattering terms. “He’s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy,” he told The Washington Post.According to a statement of offense signed as part of his guilty plea, Mr. Papadopoulos admitted that he spent months last year cultivating contacts in an effort to arrange meetings between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russian government officials.Mr. Papadopoulos said a London-based professor with extensive Russian contacts introduced him to a woman described as “Putin’s niece” and told him the Russians had “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton based on “thousands of emails” of hers. (The woman was not actually related to President Vladimir V. Putin.)The professor, identified on Monday by a Senate aide as Joseph Mifsud, told Mr. Papadopoulos about the emails in April 2016, three months before WikiLeaks released nearly 20,000 hacked Democratic emails. Mr. Papadopoulos kept senior campaign officials informed about his efforts and they encouraged him but made clear they wanted to keep some distance publicly. “It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal,” a top campaign official wrote in an email at the time.Mr. Papadopoulos was not charged with any crime for making those efforts but instead pleaded guilty to lying to F.B.I. agents about the matter. He was arrested secretly in late July and has been cooperating ever since with the team of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.“George was a low-level volunteer who might have attended a meeting of the foreign policy advisory team, the one meeting that took place but he was not a person who was involved with the day-to-day operations of the campaign, or a person who I recall interacting with on a regular basis at all,” Corey Lewandowski, who ran the campaign before Mr. Manafort, said on the “Today” show on NBC on Tuesday.Mr. Lewandowski said he did not learn about the hacked Democratic emails until they became public. “To the best of my knowledge, absolutely not,” he said. “When I found out about that, I found out about it through public press reports.” He added that he has not spoken with the F.B.I. but would be “happy to do that unequivocally.”Mr. Papadopoulos’s efforts are the second known effort by a member of Mr. Trump’s team to obtain damaging information about Mrs. Clinton from the Russians. Several weeks after the meeting where Mr. Papadopoulos learned about the Clinton emails, Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Manafort and Jared Kushner, the future president’s son-in-law, met with a Russian lawyer after being promised incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton from the Russian government.They said later that the meeting did not yield such information, but the president has defended their decision to take the meeting as a routine opposition research. The original statement to The New York Times by Donald Trump Jr. describing the meeting, crafted with the participation of the president, omitted the promise of damaging information. Mr. Mueller is now looking into that statement.In Moscow’s initial reaction to Mr. Mueller’s indictments, Russian state-run news media and government representatives on Tuesday emphasized that the accusations laid out against Mr. Manafort did not mention Russia. Instead, media reports highlighted that he was accused for his actions in Ukraine. But his work in Ukraine was for the pro-Russian party of President Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was driven out of office by street protests in 2014.Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, called all accusations of Russia’s involvement in last year’s election “laughable, unqualified, groundless and unsubstantiated.”“From what we have read in the media and seen in the statements by participants of this process, so far Russia was not mentioned in any way in the accusations, other countries were,” Mr. Peskov said at his regular news briefing.“Moscow has never felt guilty to feel vindicated now,” Mr. Peskov said. “We were always puzzled about these groundless and unsubstantiated accusations of Russia’s alleged involvement in American elections,” he said. “We have resolutely denied them from the beginning and we deny them now.”American social media companies told Congress on Monday that Russia was prolific in its efforts to reach American voters last year to sow discord. Russian agents published inflammatory posts that reached 126 million users on Facebook, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded over 1,000 videos to Google’s YouTube service, according to prepared remarks obtained by The Times.', '', 'Donald Trump, North Korea, South China Sea: Your Thursday Briefing - The New York TimesGood morning.

(It’s a “Frankenpastry” hybrid that is half croissant, half doughnut.)But the croissant, it turns out, was always a hybrid. According to local lore and “Larousse Gastronomique,” it was created in Budapest in 1686, or Vienna in 1683, to celebrate the defeat of the Ottomans, and was later adopted by the French. The crescent shape, the story goes, was inspired by the Ottoman flag.We asked the head of our Cooking department, Sam Sifton, for a recipe — but it turns out, we’re still working on one. “We haven’t yet developed one that’s really, truly accessible to the home cook,” he told us. “Croissants are hard!”Here’s his advice: “We find the best ones we can at the bakery, eat a few and let the rest go a little stale, so we can use them in Melissa Clark’s incredible recipe for a buttery breakfast casserole.

China is the North\'s No. 1 trading partner and source of aid and diplomatic support.Some U.S. officials say Beijing seems increasingly cooperative with U.S. efforts to force U.N. sanctions upon North Korea as a way to change the North’s behavior, Reuters reported.Trump\'s meeting with Xi in November will be the next test of that cooperation."Our two presidents have developed a very regular and close working relationship," Tillerson told Yang on Saturday, AFP reported. "I know President Trump is very much looking forward to the upcoming summit as is everyone on his team."Yang, who is China\'s most senior diplomat, said Trump\'s trip was of "great importance" for Sino-US relations, the report said.But just how much progress Tillerson can make on North Korea through talks with the Chinese remained unclear, the report said.The secretary of state is “working against the unified view of our intelligence agencies, which say there’s no amount of pressure that can be put on [North Korea] to stop,” Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., told a Senate hearing Thursday.That’s because North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sees nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles as “his ticket to survival,” rather than a bargaining chip, Corker said.Meanwhile, Tillerson was also expected to restate concerns about China\'s massive trade surplus with the U.S. -- $347 billion last year -- and what American companies say are unfair barriers to investment, including pressure to hand over their technology.Washington wants Beijing to make good on its promise to let market forces have a bigger role in its economy, give equal treatment to foreign and Chinese companies and roll back state industry\'s dominance.As for Trump, the president’s planned visit to China in November will come just weeks after Xi is expected to receive a new five-year term as leader of the ruling Communist Party.Since taking office in January, Trump has forged a personal connection with Xi over phone calls and through an April meeting between the two leaders at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.In a prelude to his trip to Beijing, Trump met Thursday with Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong in Washington.The Associated Press contributed reporting to this story.', "HANOI, Vietnam – Vietnam's ruling Communist Party has fired the party boss of the central city of Danang, which will host next month's Asia Pacific summit, which U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to attend.The government said in a statement Friday that the party's elite Central Committee dismissed Nguyen Xuan Anh as city party secretary and removed him from the committee for serious violations and mistakes that damaged the party's image and caused anger among the public and party members.The party's inspection committee said last month that Anh had violated party rules and used a car and two houses belonging to private businesses.The party has stepped up its anti-corruption drive, jailing or arresting dozens of senior officials and executives.", '                                    Elaine Simmons was ordered to remove her "Toot for Trump" sign for violating county codes after someone complained.

Clocks in parts of Australia have moved, too, in the opposite direction.The reason for the shift is contentious and confusing. (It isn’t for farmers, as you may have learned in school.)Historians have traced the notion for daylight saving time to Benjamin Franklin, who realized he was sleeping through some daylight hours while visiting Paris in the 18th century.But the first idea to actually move the clock hands came from William Willett, who unsuccessfully proposed daylight saving time to the British Parliament in 1908. Germany, seeking cost savings during World War I, heard the idea and enacted it in 1915. Three weeks later, the British followed, and other world powers were close behind, including the U.S. in 1918.Despite the common belief that U.S. farmers supported the change, they were actually the strongest lobby against the change because it disrupted their schedules, said David Prerau, the author of “Seize the Daylight.”“I don’t know how that ever became a myth, but it is the exact opposite,” he said.You can find out more about daylight saving time here.Daniel Victor contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

"It\'s quite ridiculous that such a person could become a politician."Ordinary North Koreans normally share only government-approved statements when speaking to foreign reporters, according to AFP.The Associated Press contributed to this story.', 'SEOUL, South Korea – On the surface it seems like more of the same: North Korea responds to another threat by U.S. President Donald Trump by calling him a "deranged" old man who will "pay dearly" for his insults.These words, however, carry the weight of an unprecedented personal rebuke from North Korea\'s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un.Behind Kim\'s colorful language released Friday is a remarkable window into the thinking — albeit filtered through state media — of the leader of a country that, despite opposition by the world\'s sole superpower, stands on the brink of nuclear weapons mastery.Here are five things to know about Kim Jong Un\'s statement:___HE\'S BREAKING GROUNDIt was written in the first person, and issued directly to the international community generally and to Trump specifically.Seoul\'s Unification Ministry, which is responsible for North-South relations, said it was the first time a North Korean leader had addressed the world with such a direct statement.The ministry said neither of the two men to rule North Korea before Kim Jong Un — his father, Kim Jong Il, and his grandfather, national founder Kim Il Sung — issued any similar statements.It could be that Kim felt that a direct, personal response was crucial because of the harshness of Trump\'s comments. The U.S. president vowed to unleash "fire and fury" on North Korea, used the nickname "Rocket Man" for Kim, and at the U.N. on Tuesday threatened to "totally destroy" the North if provoked.___HE\'S ISSUING A WARNINGThe statement suggests more powerful weapons tests are in the works.North Korea\'s foreign minister seemed to confirm this on the sidelines of a global U.N. meeting in New York, telling reporters that Kim\'s comments could mean that North Korea will conduct an H-bomb test in the Pacific, according to South Korea\'s Yonhap news agency.Ri Yong Ho added that no one knows for sure, and Kim would make any decisions on such a test, which would be viewed as massively provocative by Washington.Analysts in Seoul also saw the statement as a warning that more tests, possibly of the country\'s developmental intercontinental ballistic missiles, should be expected.___HE\'S PLAYING THE STATESMANBelieve it or not, Kim\'s statement actually used gentler language than his propaganda specialists have favored in the past.Granted, he called Trump a "mentally deranged U.S. dotard" (a word to describe a fragile elderly person) and a "frightened dog."But this is a far cry from North Korea at its worst.North Korea has previously embraced racist, sexist and just plain rude statements about its enemies. It repeatedly called one past South Korean leader "rat faced." It has said that the South\'s first female president, Park Geun-hye, was a "crafty prostitute" and suggested ex-President Barack Obama was her pimp. It also called Obama a "monkey."Trump will surely not appreciate the language, but it\'s a far cry from North Korean anger at full force. That suggests Kim could be trying to take a more statesmanlike path than his state media.___HE FEELS JUSTIFIEDKim says Trump\'s threats only emphasize that North Korea has been justified in its pursuit of nuclear missiles.North Korea has long said that its weapons tests are necessary because of U.S. hostility, which for Pyongyang includes the nearly 80,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan and South Korea.Each Trump threat plays into this narrative.Here\'s the key line in Kim\'s argument: "His (Trump\'s) remarks which described the U.S. option through straightforward expression of his will have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last."__HE\'S INSULTEDKim seemed to take umbrage that Trump was personally insulting him. After all, he typically leaves the threats to his propaganda mavens and lower-level officials.Kim essentially says that he expected better of Trump. Because the U.S. president was speaking publicly on the world stage at the U.N., Kim thought he\'d resort to "stereo-typed, prepared remarks a little different from what he used to utter in his office on the spur of the moment.""But, far from making remarks of any persuasive power that can be viewed to be helpful to defusing tension, he made unprecedented rude nonsense one has never heard from any of his predecessors," Kim continued.Kim offered some unsolicited advice to Trump as well. He advised the president "to exercise prudence in selecting words and to be considerate of whom he speaks to when making a speech in front of the world."He added that "Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world."In a country where Kim\'s word is law, the message seems clear: This will not stand.', 'JERUSALEM – If President Donald Trump moves to scuttle the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, Israel\'s nationalist government can be expected to be the loudest — and perhaps only — major player to applaud.But the true picture is more complicated than what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might portray: There is a strong sense among his own security establishment that there are few good alternatives, that the deal has benefited Israel, and that U.S. credibility could be squandered in the turbulent Middle East in ways that could harm Israel itself.That is not to say that Israel\'s respected security chiefs are all pleased with every aspect of the Iran deal. But after Netanyahu declared at the United Nations last month that it was time to "fix it or nix it," the prevailing attitude among security officials seems to be that fixing it is the best way to go."It seems to me that the less risky approach is to build on the existing agreement, among other reasons because it does set concrete limitations on the Iranians," said Uzi Arad, a former national security adviser to Netanyahu. "It imposes ceilings and benchmarks and verification systems that you do not want to lose. Why lose it?"Israel considers Iran to be its greatest foe, citing its decades of hostile rhetoric, support for anti-Israel militant groups and its development of long-range missiles. Israeli decision-makers see a nuclear-armed Iran as an existential threat.With Iran believed to be rapidly closing in on developing nuclear weapons, then-President Barack Obama led a coalition of world powers, including Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China, to the nuclear agreement in 2015. The deal offered Iran relief from crippling economic sanctions in exchange for strict limits on its nuclear program.As the deal was being finalized, Netanyahu frantically tried to block it, claiming it did not go far enough. Among his concerns: clauses that will lift the restrictions on Iran next decade, quick relief from sanctions, an imperfect system of inspections and the failure to address Iran\'s other belligerent behavior such as missile tests and involvement in regional conflicts. Netanyahu\'s opposition was so intense that he delivered a speech to the U.S. Congress railing against the emerging deal in early 2015, setting off a crisis in relations with Obama that never healed.On the campaign trail last year, Trump frequently criticized the Iran deal and vowed to rip it up if he was elected. In his own speech to the U.N. last month, Trump called it "one of the worst and most one-sided transactions" in U.S. history. Netanyahu said he had never heard a "bolder or more courageous speech" at the U.N.Following up on his U.N. performance, Trump is scheduled to deliver a speech Thursday in which he is expected to "decertify" the nuclear deal by claiming that Iran has not upheld the spirit of the agreement.This would not immediately pull the U.S. out of the deal. Instead, it would kick it over to Congress, which will then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. If that happens, Iran has threatened to walk away.Most of Trump\'s top national security aides do not want to dismantle the nuclear deal, and America\'s European allies have also urged the Trump administration not to walk away.Netanyahu\'s office said he discussed the matter of decertification with Trump when they met last month, but gave no further details. But he is likely to praise any move toward scrapping the nuclear deal.In an opinion column published in The New York Times last week, Michael Oren, Netanyahu\'s former ambassador to Washington and now a deputy minister for diplomacy, argued that decertification would not be the disaster that critics have predicted.He said if the deal is ultimately canceled, it should be replaced by "crippling sanctions." If retained, he said it should be improved to include stricter inspections of suspect nuclear sites, harsh penalties for violations, and eliminating the "sunset clause" that will gradually end the deal."Either way, revisiting the agreement will send an unequivocal message to the world," Oren said. "It will say that the United States is truly unwilling to accept a nuclear Iran — not now, not in a decade, not ever."As Trump\'s decision nears, however, a number of prominent security experts in Israel are publicly and privately advocating that the deal be left intact and its shortcomings addressed separately.These experts say that the U.S., in consultation with Israel, should work with its allies to engage Iran on their many concerns. Simply walking away would hurt American credibility and put it at odds not only with Iran, but with its partners who remain committed to the deal."You cannot reverse that easily without paying a price," said Arad, Netanyahu\'s former security adviser. "It would simply be a suboptimal and riskier route to go. So I say build on it, reinforce it, enforce it and address other issues without causing kind of self-inflicted losses in the process."Arad said that while there is a healthy debate over how to move forward, he believes that based on his discussions with both retired and active security officials, the prevailing view among experts on the issue is that the deal should be preserved.Top military officials, for instance, say that Iran has scrupulously upheld its commitments in the deal. This calm on the nuclear front has allowed them to focus on their other concerns about Iranian behavior, most critically its involvement in neighboring Syria and its support for the powerful Lebanese militant group Hezbollah."The Iran deal is a deal that contains both problems and shortcomings, but its advantages outweigh the weaknesses by far," said Efraim Halevy, a former director of the Mossad intelligence service.Yaakov Amidror, another former national security adviser to Netanyahu, said he did not think that scrapping the deal is even possible, given the position of America\'s partners. "What should be done is to enhance it. Make it a much better agreement," he said.Yoel Guzansky, a former Iran specialist on the Israeli National Security Council, said that sending the deal to Congress is a "hasty" decision that could backfire.He said the best way to gain leverage over Iran and alter its behavior is through concerted international action. Working together, he said, the international community could pursue various options, including diplomacy, a U.N. resolution or even threatening military action."We need to build an international coalition, which we lack right now. No one except Trump and Netanyahu, with all due respect, is supporting this move right now," said Guzansky, a senior fellow at INSS, a prominent Israeli think tank. "I really hope the two gentlemen have a program."Chemi Shalev, a columnist with the Haaretz daily, said Netanyahu was playing with fire by pushing Washington to break an agreement."Washington\'s signature on any accord will be significantly devalued, and its demands for new agreements with Iran, North Korea or for Middle East peace would henceforth be greeted with polite mockery," he said.Dan Shapiro, who served as Obama\'s ambassador to Israel when the deal was negotiated, said the lack of alternatives and the uncertainty that canceling the deal would bring are causes of great concern to the Israeli security establishment."They don\'t know what will happen if the deal unravels, but it\'s much more likely that they\'re going to be faced with their decision point on Iranian nuclear capability much sooner without the deal than with it," he said.___Associated Press writer Ian Deitch in Jerusalem contributed.', "Why aren't missiles and military sites part of the current deal?President Donald Trump followed up his Iran speech announcing that he would not be certifying the Iran nuclear deal by also making clear his administration stood in solidarity with ordinary Iranians. Just two days later, thousands of Iranians marched against the regime over charges of corruption. Some experts say the protesters were newly emboldened by Trump’s speech.Speaking exclusively to Fox News before the protests, Maryam Rajavi, the head of that country’s most visibly active opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), said that Trump’s new policy toward Iran gives ordinary Iranians hope.“The Iranian people welcome a new approach by the U.S. government, recognizing the suffering of the Iranian people under the regime, ending years of misguided policy and siding with the Iranian people in their desire for regime change and the establishment of freedom and democracy,” she said in a recorded statement from her exiled headquarters near Paris.Rajavi is seen by some Iran watchers as one someone the White House should be engaging with on Iran’s future.Heshmat Alavi, an Iranian political and rights activist said that Rajavi enjoys vast support in Iran.“Mrs. Rajavi is the voice of a very restive society, described as a ‘powder keg’ by many, seen so vividly in the growing protests by the younger generation, women and most recently by thousands of investors across the country who have trusted their life savings into government institutions, only to be robbed of all their assets,” he said.Alavi said dissent against the clerical regime is growing especially given recent allegations that the regime took investors for their lifesavings.TRUMP DECERTIFIES IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL“Sunday afternoon Tehran witnessed a demonstration by thousands of people chanting, ‘We don’t want a government of sheikhs,’ expressing their dissent with the ruling regime in its entirety,” he said.Walid Phares, a Fox News national security and foreign policy expert, said that while the Obama administration abandoned Iranian protesters in 2009, preferring to engage with the regime, President Trump has a different goal.“This narrative is rekindling hopes among young Iranians that the new administrator is changing the tone. Interestingly President Trump spoke of the Iranian people and how it is oppressed by the regime just few days ago. With satellite TV and social media, millions of Iranians captured the new messaging. Did that influence the several demonstrations that took place over the past weekend in Tehran and other locations —highly possible. Iran civil society is moving again and they know there is a different White House,” Phares said.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a veteran Middle East analyst close to the White House told Fox News that the Trump administration wants the Iranian people to know they are targeting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC) and not the people.“They know Iran is a rich and ancient civilization and that the Iranian people were the first victims of the regime. They’re not going to make excuses for the IRGC regime like the Obama team did. That was a huge part of President Trump’s speeches at the U.N. and last week.”Trump also designated the IRGC for its terrorist activities in last week’s speech on Iran.In her comments to Fox News, Rajavi called for regime change and for governments to recognize her group as a more enlightened replacement to the regime.“It is imperative that the National Council of Resistance of Iran be recognized as the democratic alternative to the terrorist dictatorship ruling Iran. Such recognition would rectify decades of a misguided U.S. policy regarding the Iranian people,” she continued.“Dissent has grown significantly among the Iranian people, especially among women and young people. Regime change by the Iranian people and resistance is within reach,” she told Fox News.So far it is believed that the Trump administration has not reached out to any of the Iranian opposition groups. Most of that outreach ended with the Obama administration because of its intense focus on Obama’s quest to make a deal with the Iranian regime.Ben Evansky reports for Fox Newson the United Nations and international affairs.He can befollowed@BenEvansky", 'Donald Trump, Remembrance Day, Climate Talks: Your Monday Briefing - The New York Times(Want to get this briefing by email?

Sad!1) You must have my smash hit of a Broadway show confused with your  presidency-- which IS a total bomb and WILL indeed close early. NOT SAD https://t.co/URgXgzWWVkMoore\'s show, "The Terms of My Surrender," ended its 13-week run Oct. 22. The website BroadwayWorld.com reported that it took in $4.2 million at the box office, less than half of its potential take.The show, which combined Moore\'s autobiography with calls for political action against Trump and other Republicans, was a critical disappointment as well. The New York Times described "Terms of My Surrender" as "shaggy and self-aggrandizing.""You don’t have to disagree with Mr. Moore’s politics to find that his shtick has become disagreeable with age," wrote reviewer Jesse Green, who compared the show to "being stuck at Thanksgiving dinner with a garrulous, self-regarding, time-sucking uncle."Moore has been an outspoken critic of Trump. In August, Moore led the show\'s audience to Trump Tower to protest the president\'s reaction to deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. That same night, he compared the president\'s supporters to accomplices in a rape during an interview with CNN."If you hold down the woman while the rapist is raping her, and you didn\'t rape her, are you a rapist?" Moore said at the time. "Let\'s cut the BS and start speaking honestly."This week, Moore told the Wall Street Journal in an email that the show was "the most artistically gratifying experience of my life" and said there were "talks happening about taking this show on the road."The Associated Press contributed to this report.', '', '', 'Trump Pitches Tax Cuts as ‘Rocket Fuel’ for the Economy - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump took his push for deep tax cuts to a supportive audience of manufacturers on Friday, arguing that reducing levies on businesses will be “rocket fuel” to propel economic growth and ultimately translate to more jobs and better wages for American workers, as well.Still seeking a major first-year legislative victory after the latest failure of his bid to repeal and replace his predecessor’s health care system, Mr. Trump sought to rally business support for his tax package even as special-interest lobbyists already have begun mobilizing to save breaks and provisions threatened by the plan.“Under my administration, the era of economic surrender is over and the rebirth of American industry is beginning,” he said in a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers. “America is winning again and America is being respected again.” Arguing that most manufacturers will see their tax rates fall to levels not seen in many years, Mr. Trump said, “it will be rocket fuel for our economy.”For their part, Democrats hammered away at the plan, contending that it offered little relief for the middle class and would mainly benefit the wealthy, including Mr. Trump himself, who by one analysis could save $1 billion. A new video posted online by the Democratic National Committee summed up its side of the argument with the headline: “Trump’s tax plan = $1 billion for Trump, ‘zero’ for 1/3 of Americans.”The framework crafted by the administration with Republican lawmakers would lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and create a new 25 percent rate for so-called pass-through businesses like partnerships and sole proprietorships that are currently taxed at the rate of their owners.About 95 percent of businesses in the United States are structured as pass-throughs, and they account for most of the corporate tax revenue paid to the government. Businesses would be allowed to deduct the full cost of new equipment in the first year rather than spread it out over time.For individual taxpayers, the plan would collapse the tax brackets to three from seven, lowering rates for many while doubling the standard deduction and increasing the child tax credit. It would eliminate the tax on estates larger than $5.49 million for individuals and about $11 million for couples, while canceling the alternative minimum tax, which is meant to ensure that the wealthiest still pay but has increasingly affected middle-class taxpayers as well. To offset some of the cost, it would cancel deductions for state and local income taxes.Mr. Trump said the net effect would be “a giant, beautiful, massive — the biggest ever in our country — tax cut” and called on business to press Congress to pass it. “With your help and your voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across this land we will bring back our great American dream,” Mr. Trump told the audience of manufacturing executives gathered at a Washington hotel.As he has done before, Mr. Trump exaggerated the economic progress made on his watch. He noted correctly that economic growth reached 3.1 percent in the second quarter of the year, but then asserted that America had not seen such growth in “a very, very long time.” In fact, the economy was growing that fast as recently as the start of 2015 and, since 2009, every year but one saw at least one quarter with even higher growth.But in addressing the manufacturers association, Mr. Trump was preaching to the choir. The group said a survey of its members found that most reported that a package of tax cuts would make them more likely to expand their business, hire more workers and increase wages and benefits. The group’s survey found that over the past nine months, 91 percent felt optimistic about the outlook for their businesses, the highest three-quarter average in its 20-year history.“Today’s tax code lets other countries win, and our workers and our families are paying the price and we have an obligation to speak out,” said Jay Timmons, the association’s president. “It’s time to go big, it’s time to go bold — and manufacturers are grateful to have a president who agrees.”', '                                    FILE - In this March 17, 2017, file photo Ivanka Trump, the daughter of President Trump, and her husband Jared Kushner, senior adviser to President Donald Trump, attend a joint news conference with the president at the White House.

But he stops well short of torpedoing the pact, which was negotiated over 18 months by the Obama administration, European allies and others.Instead, Trump will kick the issue over to Congress, asking lawmakers to come up with new legislation that would automatically re-impose sanctions should Iran cross any one of numerous nuclear and non-nuclear "trigger points," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said in remarks released ahead of Trump\'s announcement.Those "trigger points" would include violations of the deal involving illicit atomic work or ballistic missile testing, support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon\'s Hezbollah movement and other groups that destabilize the region, human rights abuses and cyber warfare, they said.Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to snap the sanctions back into place, modify the law or do nothing. Any decision to re-impose sanctions would automatically kill America\'s participation in the deal.In a White House speech on Friday afternoon, Trump will notify Congress that he is "decertifying" the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, arguing that while Iran is complying with the letter of the agreement, the accord itself is not sufficient to be in U.S. interests."We don\'t dispute that they\'re under technical compliance," Tillerson said. "We\'ve said the agreement has a number of weaknesses in it, and, in fact, one of the weaknesses is the standard to remain in technical compliance is not that difficult, or has not been that difficult for them to meet."In remarks ahead of his address to a group of conservative voters, Trump previewed his position by calling Iran "a terrorist nation like few others" and urged his audience to listen in.Both defenders of the Iran nuclear deal and critics are likely to be displeased by Trump\'s decision. Those who support the deal believe Trump\'s move will badly damage U.S. credibility in future international negotiations, while opponents think he does not go far enough in unraveling the accord.Trump will urge lawmakers to codify tough new requirements for Tehran to continue to benefit from the sanctions relief that it won in exchange for curbing its atomic program, according to Tillerson. And he\'ll announce his long-anticipated intent to impose sanctions on Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard Corps by designating it a terrorist organization under an existing executive order."The reckless behavior of the Iranian regime, and the IRGC in particular, poses one of the most dangerous threats to the interests of the United States and to regional stability," the White House said in a statement. The statement denounced the Obama administration for its "myopic focus on Iran\'s nuclear program to the exclusion of the regime\'s many other malign activities" and said the same "mistakes" would not be repeated.Ali Larijani, Iran\'s parliament speaker, said Friday that any U.S. move against a nuclear deal with Iran would be an "insult" to the United Nations because the U.N. had given the deal its blessing.He added that any revision of the deal would allow Iran to take its own actions, and warned that the U.S. move could destabilize the international situation."We will continue to adhere to our obligations ... for as long as other parties observe the agreement," he said on a visit to Russia.In his speech, Trump also will ask Congress to amend or replace legislation that currently requires him to certify Iranian compliance every 90 days. Officials have said that Trump hates the requirement more than the nuclear deal itself because it forces him to take a position every three months on the deal. That frequency hassend also irritated aides who have complained that they are spending inordinate amounts of time on certification at the expense of other issues.American allies, who have pressed the White House to remain in the nuclear accord, will be closely watching the president\'s address. Trump wants to impress on the European parties to the accord — Germany, France and Britain — the importance of fixing what he sees as flaws in the nuclear accord and addressing malign behavior not covered in the agreement.The Europeans, along with the other parties, Iran, Russia and China, have ruled out reopening the deal. But some, notably France, have signaled a willingness to tackle unresolved issues in supplementary negotiations.Among those issues are the expiration of several restrictions on advanced nuclear activity under so-called "sunset clauses" that will allow Iran to begin ramping up its enrichment capabilities after 10 years, the end of an arms embargo and the eventual easing of demands for a halt to its missile program.In the speech, Trump hopes to "recruit" the Europeans into joining his broad strategy, particularly by punishing the Revolutionary Guard, which he and his national security team believe is fomenting instability, violence and extremism throughout the Middle East and beyond, according to one official.In anticipation of Trump\'s announcements, Republican legislators have drawn up a new version of the law replacing the current 90-day timetable with "semi-annual" certifications, according to drafts seen by the Associated Press this week.Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker said in a statement on Friday that his panel had agreed to fresh certification criteria to include items that are also the province of the U.N. nuclear watchdog and require the U.S. intelligence community to determine if Iran is carrying out illicit activity in facilities to which the International Atomic Energy Agency has not had access.___Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.', '                                    Kirstjen Nielsen would replace White House Chief of Staff John Kelly as secretary of homeland security.

Her departure from the White House would leave Kelly looking to fill another crucial administrative vacancy.Neilsen is an expert in homeland and national security policy. She previously worked as a special assistant to George W.

What he did not do was what many predecessors have done before: highlight human rights abuses while overseas.Duterte has overseen a bloody drug war that has featured extrajudicial killings. He has even boasted about killing people with his own hands. But during brief remarks to reporters, Trump said he and Duterte have "had a great relationship" and avoided questions on whether he\'d raise human rights issues with the Filipino leaders.The White House later said the two leaders discussed the Islamic State group, illegal drugs and trade during the 40-minute meeting. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said human rights came up "briefly" in the context of the Philippines\' fight against illegal drugs. She did not say if Trump was critical of Duterte\'s program.That appeared to conflict with the Filipino version of the meeting. Harry Roque, a spokesman for Duterte, said, "There was no mention of human rights. There was no mention of extralegal killings. There was only a rather lengthy discussion of the Philippine war on drugs with President Duterte doing most of the explaining."Despite all that, the two sides later issued a joint statement saying that "the two sides underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs."On the sidelines of an international summit, Trump looked to strengthen ties with Pacific Rim allies, aiming to strike bilateral rather than multinational trade agreements, and increase pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. He met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and highlighted their two nations\' "deeper and more comprehensive" ties, looking to strengthen a relationship that is vital to the U.S. vision of an Indo-Pacific region that attempts to de-emphasize China\'s influence.He jointly met with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, with whom he had a contentious phone call last winter, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who hosted the president in Tokyo earlier in the trip. Trump raved about his accomplishments on his five-nation journey, particularly on trade and on North Korea, which the White House has suggested may be designated a state sponsor of terror.Trump said he would wait until his return to Washington on Wednesday to elaborate with a "major statement" on those two topics but hinted at progress while in Manila."We\'ve made some very big steps with regard to trade — far bigger than anything you know," Trump told reporters, pointing to business deals forged between U.S. and foreign companies."We\'ve made a lot of big progress on trade. We have deficits with almost everybody. Those deficits are going to be cut very quickly and very substantially," Trump said."Except us," Turnbull chimed in, to laughs."You\'re the only one," Trump responded. Trump also said the trip had been "very fruitful" for the United States and pointed to the warm welcomes he had received in capitals like Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing."It was red carpet like nobody, I think, has probably ever received," Trump said. "And that really is a sign of respect, perhaps for me a little, but really for our country. And I\'m really proud of that."Trump met privately with Turnbull later Monday. But his interactions with Duterte drew the most scrutiny.Advisers had said that while Trump was always unlikely to publicly chastise Duterte, he might offer criticisms behind closed doors. Trump would hold his tongue in public to avoid embarrassing Duterte, whom he is urging to help pressure North Korea and fight terrorism, and to avoid pushing him into the arms of China. Duterte has seemed less committed to the strategic partnership with the U.S.Duterte\'s war on drugs has alarmed human rights advocates around the world who say it has allowed police officers and vigilantes to ignore due process and to take justice into their own hands. Government officials estimate that well over 3,000 people, mostly drug users and dealers, have died in the ongoing crackdown. Human rights groups believe the victim total is far higher, perhaps closer to 9,000.The opening ceremonies of the Association for Southeast Asian Nations conference began with pageantry, including a group photo of the leaders and the summit\'s traditional handshake. That cross-body handshake, during which each leader shakes the opposite hands of those next to him or her, briefly baffled Trump, who then laughed as he figured out where to place his arms.___Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Laurie Kellman in Washington contributed to this report.___Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Colvin at http://twitter.com/@Colvinj', "John Roberts reports from the White House on the push to secure 50 votes.Congress returns Tuesday from Thanksgiving recess, giving Capitol Hill roughly 15 days before leaving town until January to get a string of key legislative items, most notably tax reform, to President Donald Trump’s desk by the end of the year.Senate Republicans are considering a trigger that would automatically increase taxes if their sweeping legislation fails to generate as much revenue as they expect. It’s an effort to gain support from deficit hawks who worry that tax cuts for businesses and individuals would add to the nation’s already mounting debt.The effort comes as a second Republican senator, Steve Daines of Montana, announced Monday that he opposes the tax bill in its current form. Previously, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he opposed the bill, leaving Senate Republicans no room for error as they aim to vote on the bill this week.Both senators complained that the tax bill favors large corporations over small businesses.In a Monday morning tweet, the president wrote, “With just a few changes, some mathematical, the middle class and job producers can get even more in actual dollars and savings.”Trump has suggested he'd be open to making unspecified changes to the way millions of “pass-through” businesses are taxed, a sticking point for some lawmakers.Republicans have only two votes to spare in the Senate, where they hold a 52-48 edge and anticipate Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie, if needed.Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said Senate Republicans “intend to get to 50” votes in the chamber. After meeting with Trump on Monday, Hatch called for Senate Democrats to “get off their duffs” and work with Republicans on the bill.Trump is set to meet Tuesday with top Republican and Democratic congressional leaders, which could edge the government closer to a year-end bipartisan fiscal deal — or a federal shutdown.Trump will meet with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., to discuss short-term plans as government funding is scheduled to dry up on Dec. 8.Fights over immigration and health care also are crowding the agenda, asThe Hillpoints out.At present, Congress may spend no more than $549 billion for defense programs and $516 billion for non-defense programs next year, a cut from current levels, The Washington Post reports. The Trump administration is looking to increase defense spending to more than $600 billion, while Democrats are demanding a dollar-for-dollar increase in non-defense spending.The Associated Press contributed to this report.", 'Former interim Democratic National Committee chair\'s allegations that the DNC rigged the nomination for Clinton has exposed the deep schism in the Democratic party that may not heal as midterm elections approach. #TuckerStill reeling from Hillary Clinton’s loss to Donald Trump in last year’s presidential election and wondering how to move forward, the schism within the Democratic Party appears to have widened even more in the wake of the bombshell claims made Thursday by a former interim party boss.The allegations by Donna Brazile not only asserted that the Democratic National Committee helped rig last year’s presidential primary in favor of Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, but also raised a number of troubling questions as the party attempts to regroup ahead of next year’s midterm elections.Are Brazile’s revelations the first shots in a virtual civil war between the Democratic establishment faithful to the Clintons and a growing progressive wing represented by lawmakers like Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren? Is this the final nail in the coffin for Clinton\'s influence within the Democratic Party? Will this scandal linger into 2020 when the party challengesTrump for the White House?“This is standard in politics when you don’t have the presidency because there is nobody in charge of the party,” Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist and Fox News contributor, told Fox News. “You’re going to have an all-out battle and a new voice will eventually emerge.”Finding out who that voice is and when it will emerge appears, for the time being, to be a long way away as the fallout from Brazile’s claims reverberate throughout the Democratic Party."It was obviously a shocking revelation," Sanders\' campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN on Friday. “"It was pretty clear that they were on the Clinton side ... I don\'t think any of us imagined that there was actually a formal arrangement giving the Clinton campaign control of the DNC.”In her new book – excerpts of which were published on Politico – Brazile writes that the DNC signed a joint fundraising agreement document with the Hillary Victory Fund and Hillary for America. It had been signed in August 2015, four months after Clinton announced her candidacy and a year before she officially secured the nomination over Sanders.“The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised,” Brazile wrote. “Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff.”Defenders of Clinton have noted that the Sanders’ campaign also signed its own joint fundraising agreement with the DNC during the campaign season.Brazile took over as the interim DNC chairman in 2016 when Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced out as chairman over emails that indicated the party organization unfairly favored Clinton over Sanders during the primary. DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa, who works under current DNC chairman Tom Perez, told Fox News that the party “must remain neutral in the presidential primary process, and there shouldn’t even be a perception that the DNC is interfering in that process.” But it appears the damage has been done.Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii said Brazile’s revelations confirmed “what many suspected for a long time” and added that the “deep financial debt, closed door decision-making, complete lack of transparency, and unethical practices are now front and center.”Gabbard’s statement was preceded by a video earlier in this week in which she slammed Perez for a recent overhaul of the party’s executive committee, which she said was intended “to cast out those who haven’t fallen in line with the establishment and who are actually demanding real reform.”The DNC shrugged off the qualms of independents & progressives in 2016. Unfortunately, it appears they haven’t learned from their mistakes. pic.twitter.com/8cfzA3hHccMassachusetts’ Warren, who campaigned for Clinton during the presidential campaign and is rumored to be eyeing a run herself in 2020, said “yes” when asked if the campaign was rigged and called it “a real problem.”"But what we\'ve got to do as Democrats now, is we\'ve got to hold this party accountable," she said, according to the BBC.Trump weighed in on social media on the mounting scandal and said the American public “deserves” an inquiry, while lashing out at Clinton in a series of tweets.The real story on Collusion is in Donna B\'s new book.

Why was Larry David making jokes about trying to pick up women at a concentration camp? Who thought it would be a good idea for Alec Baldwin, of all people, to take satirical potshots at Harvey Weinstein?These were just some of the questions raised by this weekend’s head-scratching installment of “Saturday Night Live,” which was hosted by Mr. David and featured Miley Cyrus as musical guest. Even after an extra hour of sleep, we’re still not certain we can adequately answer them.This week’s cold open featured Mr. Baldwin in his recurring role as Mr. Trump, visiting Paul Manafort (played by the “S.N.L.” cast member Alex Moffat), his recently indicted former campaign chairman, while he is under house arrest.“God, you’re screwed,” Mr. Baldwin told him. “You’re so, so screwed. It’s a shame you’re going to prison. Because I was about to give you a huge tax break. According to my tax plan, cut cut cut. Because it was named while I was having a small stroke. Speaking of cuts, do you have a good shiv you can bring with you to prison, Paul? Because after the stuff I’ve said about certain ethnic groups, they are really going to go to town on you in prison.”After a quick cutaway to Melania Trump (Cecily Strong), the sketch returned to the characters of Mr. Trump and Mr. Manafort, who are now standing in a shower.Mr. Baldwin explained he had to make certain that Mr. Moffat wasn’t wearing a wire. “I would never do that with you,” Mr. Moffat said.Mr. Baldwin answered, “That’s what she said. Like, a whole bunch of she’s have said that. Speaking of which, what an idiot that Harvey Weinstein is. He could have gotten away with all of it, if only he’d gotten himself elected president.”It was an awkward juxtaposition, at a time when a growing number of Hollywood figures are being confronted with claims of sexual misdeeds.Mr. Baldwin has lately come under scrutiny for his friendship with the filmmaker James Toback, who has faced widespread accusations of sexual misconduct and abuse. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Mr. Baldwin said he had “no idea” that Mr. Toback had “done anything criminal.” “If that’s true, that’s news to me,” Mr. Baldwin said. “I never had any idea that Jimmy’s appetites took him in that direction.”During a tribute on Thursday at the Paley Center for Media, Mr. Baldwin said, “I certainly have treated women in a very sexist way. I’ve bullied women. I’ve overlooked women. I’ve underestimated women. Not as a rule.”On Saturday, Mr. Baldwin said he would suspend posting at his @AlecBaldwin Twitter account, following criticism of an interview he gave to PBS in which he seemed to blame some of the actresses who have accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct.“You heard the rumor that he raped Rose McGowan,” Mr. Baldwin said in the interview. “You heard that over and over — we heard that for decades. And nothing was done.”He added, “Rose McGowan took a payment of $100,000 and settled her case with him. And it was for Rose McGowan to prosecute that case.”Following that interview, Mr. Baldwin wrote on Twitter, “my heart goes out to all such victims. My goal is to do better in all things related to gender equality. Au revoir.”As for “S.N.L.”, it still had another 85 minutes to go.Mr. David, the creator and star of the HBO cringe-comedy “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” took the stage by joking to the audience, “You tolerate me. You really, really tolerate me.” He then put that proposition to the test with a discomforting monologue that even his cable-TV alter ego would have had trouble getting away with.“A lot of sexual harassment stuff in the news of late,” the real Mr. David said. “And, uh, I couldn’t help but notice a very disturbing pattern emerging. Which is that many of the predators — not all, but many of them — are Jews.”After a long grimace, Mr. David said, “I don’t like it when Jews are in the headlines for notorious reasons. I want, ‘Einstein Discovers the Theory of Relativity.’ ‘Salk Cures Polio.’ What I don’t want? ‘Weinstein Took It Out.’”Mr. David continued to think aloud: “You know, I’ve always, always been obsessed with women, and I’ve often wondered, if I’d grown up in Poland, when Hitler came to power, and was sent to a concentration camp, would I still be checking out women in the camp? I think I would.”He added, “Of course, the problem is, there are no good opening lines in a concentration camp.”Imagining how such an interaction might unfold, Mr. David said, “How’s it going? They treating you O.K.? You know, if we ever get out of here, I’d love to take you out for some latkes. You like latkes? What, what’d I say? Is it me or is it the whole thing? It’s ‘cause I’m bald, isn’t it?”Reprising a recurring role from last season, Mr. David played Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, this time as a contestant on a celebrity edition of “The Price Is Right.”Paired with a baffled civilian contestant (Pete Davidson), Mr. David said, “Thank you, it’s good to be here. I just want to say, this show is a travesty. Consumerism disguised as entertainment. That being said, I do need a new dinette set.”He added, “We’re going to win this thing the Bernie way. Which means if I lose, I’ll bring everyone else down with me.”In a “Weekend Update” deskside segment, Mr. Moffat and Mikey Day played the president’s sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., speaking out against the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into their father’s presidential campaign.While Mr. Moffat clumsily mimed his gestures and body language, Mr. Day explained, “We’d like to make it very clear that our father did nothing wrong. Some people who barely worked for him did. But Dad knew nothing about it. And the same goes for Eric and myself.”Colin Jost, the “Weekend Update” co-anchor, replied, “Well, I definitely believe you that Eric had no idea what was going on.”“Exactly,” Mr. Day said. “And look, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, we barely knew these guys. And as for the last guy, George — ”Mr. Moffat confidently interjected, “Doctor Octopus.”Mr. Day corrected him. “No, buddy, it’s not George Doctor Octopus, it’s George Papadopoulos,” he said.Mr. Day went onto argue that there should instead be an investigation of Mr. Trump’s Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.“As we learned from Donna Brazile,” he said. “Crooked Hillary and company did some shady back room deals with the Russians and tried to rig the election in her favor.”“Just like dad,” Mr. Moffat said.Did you fully grasp the pretaped sketch about the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders (Aidy Bryant), which crosscut between her overseeing a contentious daily press briefing and her fantasizing that she is in a music video, performing Demi Lovato’s “Confident”?

Senior administration officials have said Trump will have specific demands for his Chinese counterpart --- and will be prepared to threaten consequences if China does not abide them.Trump is expected to request that Xi impose limits on oil exports and coal imports with the rogue dictatorship, as well as broader limits on financial transactions with the regime, Reuters reported. China is responsible for more than 90 percent of all trade with North Korea.#Trump\'s Asia trip: Stops in Japan, China and beyond  https://t.co/R6agInXPaKBehind the scenes, Trump may also insist that the Chinese work to convince the North Korean government in Pyongyang to open nuclear disarmament discussions with Washington.But a former U.S. intelligence official who is informally advising the White House on Asia policy told the Washington Times that the administration is not entirely sure what it can accomplish during the president’s visit to Beijing.Experts say it is likely that, even if Trump\'s goals are uncertain of being achieved, the president will rely on various pressure points during his discussion with Xi.One indirect tool at Trump’s disposal, U.S. officials told Reuters, is the threat of imposing further economic sanctions on North Korea. The move could destabilize the already fragile North Korean economy and lead to a surge of poor refugees from North Korea into China, creating a logistical headache and a potential humanitarian crisis for Beijing.The president could also cause problems for Xi by formally investigating Chinese entities who administration officials say strong-arm U.S. companies into divulging proprietary intellectual property. The Washington Times reported that Trump, who first raised the issue with Xi during an August phone call, is prepared to renew the threat during next week\'s meeting.And Trump, who has previously threatened to reduce China’s access to U.S. markets if it does not take a harder line on North Korea, will likely target the trade imbalance between the U.S. and China. China has the largest bilateral trade surplus with the U.S. of any country, by a significant margin.Trump will probably tell the Chinese president, "‘I’m coming after you on trade,’” Christopher Johnson, a China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Washington Times.But Xi has sent signals that he may not be receptive to the White House’s position. After North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un sent Xi a congratulatory message for recently winning a second term as China’s Communist Party leader, Xi called for “stable” relations between the two countries.“I wish that under the new situation the Chinese side would make efforts with the [North Korean] side to promote the relations between the two parties and the two countries to sustainable soundness and stable development,” Xi wrote, according to North Korea\'s state-run Korean Central News Agency. Xi added that China and North Korea should focus on “defending regional peace and stability and common prosperity.”Gregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

Here\'s what declaring it an emergency will do.White House counselor Kellyanne Conway has been tapped as the Trump administration’s opioid czar.Attorney Gen. Jeff Sessions announced Conway’s new role and said the White House “made this [issue] a priority,” the Washington Examiner reported.President Trump declared the nation’s opioid epidemic to be a “public health emergency” in October. He promised to combat the health crisis in a number of ways, including promoting a massive anti-drug campaign.It’s important that the full weight of the federal government – with each Cabinet department determining their role in the crisis – is involved in tackling the epidemic, said Tom Coderre, a former official with the Obama administration’s HHS Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.“The opioid crisis is multi-faceted and multi-dimensional. It’s not like there is a secret weapon out there,” Coderre told Fox News, adding that acting HHS Secretary Eric Hargan will be able to detail exactly what will happen with the declaration. More funds or resources could be allocated to specific states struggling with the crisis.The Center for Disease Controlestimates that 91 Americans die dailyfrom opioid-involved deaths – anda recent studyby Dr. Christopher Ruhm suggests that opioid-related deaths are severely underreported.The public health emergency declaration was a long time coming, experts said. Here\'s what could happen as a result.The commission said that an emergency declaration would persuade lawmakers to allocate more funding to combat opioid addiction.Specific details about Trump’s declaration – and Hargan’s plan – are scarce, including when it comes to additional funding. Coderre, now a senior advisor at the nonprofitAltarum, said HHS could determine what federal funds states already have and possibly allow for more flexibility in spending.With the declaration, officials will be able to more easily deploy state and federal workers, secure grants for unemployed and shift funding from certain programs – such as HIV or AIDs programs – to provide substance abuse treatment for certain individuals.Gary Mendell, founder and CEO of the nonprofit Shatterproof, argued that more funding is needed in order to properly combat the opioid epidemic.“It gives the president and Congress expedited ways to fund what needs to be funded to save the lives of so many every day and mobilizes the Cabinet to attack this issue,” Mendell told Fox News.“People are talking about this more and more, but if the president were to declare this a national emergency, it creates recognition and awareness around the country that this epidemic needs right now."Jessica Hulsey Nickel, president and CEO of the Addiction Policy Forum, praised the declaration in a statement to Fox News Thursday.“Prioritizingthisnational crisis will bring much needed resources to communities, improveaccess to services and facilitate better coordination among governmentagencies. In particular, I am heartened by the decisionto bring all federalgovernment agencies to the table to play a unique role,” Nickel said.By officially declaring the issue an emergency it can raise awareness, the commission said.“It would also awaken every American to this simple fact: if this scourge has not found you or your family yet, without bold action by everyone, it soon will,” the commission said. “You, Mr. President, are the only person who can bring this type of intensity to the emergency, and we believe you have the will to do so and to do so immediately.”Mendell agreed, saying that the crisis needs more “attention and awareness.”“People are talking about this more and more, but if the president were to declare this a national emergency, it creates recognition around the country and awareness around the country that this epidemic needs right now,” he said.When asked why an emergency hadn’t already been declared, Mendell blamed the stigma associated with addiction and mental illness.But the federal declaration of emergency could help change that negative stigma, he said.HHShas issued public health emergency declarationsin the wake of natural disasters as well as the spread of diseases.The agency issued its first declaration for the Zika virus in Puerto Rico in August 2016. It was last renewed in April 2017.Public health emergencies were also declared in New York following Hurricane Sandy in November 2012 and in Missouri following a series of storms and tornadoes in May 2011.This declaration took too long as the number of daily opioid-related deaths has continued to increase, Coderre said.“It took too long to get to where we are today.

It is because Mr. Trump can somehow get away with saying and doing just about anything, and his rabid base doesn’t waver.We now hold celebrities and politicians to a standard of zero tolerance for sexual assault allegations, yet Mr. Trump has skated by, despite several allegations and his own taped admission. He has done the same when it comes to his tax returns, business interests and every other aspect of his questionable character.So if recent history is an indication, even proof of treasonous behavior won’t be enough to end this national embarrassment.GABE DOWNEY FERNDALE, MICH.', 'When Repeal and Replace Fails, Undermine and Undercut - The New York TimesPresident Donald Trump, after failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act in Congress, signed an executive order on Thursday paving the way for cheaper policies with fewer benefits.“I just keep hearing repeal-replace, repeal-replace,” Mr. Trump said in the signing ceremony.', 'BALTIMORE – Another federal judge has halted a proposed transgender military ban, expanding on an initial ruling issued last month against the plan by President Donald Trump\'s administration.In a preliminary injunction issued Tuesday in Baltimore, U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis ruled that transgender service members have "demonstrated that they are already suffering harmful consequences" due to the proposed ban including threat of discharge, stigma and the cancellation or delay of surgeries related to their gender transitions. The six plaintiffs in the lawsuit he reviewed have all been receiving hormone therapy.Trump had announced on Twitter in July that the government would not allow transgender individuals to serve in the military in any capacity. The order was a proposed reinstatement of a longstanding policy that barred transgender people from joining the military and also subjected service members to discharge if they were revealed to be transgender. That policy was changed last year under President Barack Obama.But in a strongly-worded passage from his 53-page decision, Garbis wrote that the "capricious, arbitrary, and unqualified tweet of new policy does not trump the methodical and systematic review by military stakeholders qualified to understand the ramifications of policy change."Last month, another federal judge, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, barred Trump\'s administration from proceeding with the plans to exclude transgender people from military service. She said the administration had provided no solid evidence for why a ban should be implemented. In a court filing Tuesday, the government said it would appeal Kollar-Kotelly\'s ruling.A U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman, Lauren Ehrsam, said officials disagreed with Garbis\' ruling and they are weighing their next steps."(The) plaintiffs\' lawsuit challenging military service requirements is premature for many reasons, including that the Defense Department is actively reviewing such service requirements, as the President ordered, and because none of the plaintiffs have established that they will be impacted by current policies on military service," Ehrsam said in an email.Trump sent an August memo directing the Pentagon to extend indefinitely a ban on transgender individuals joining the military, and gave Defense Secretary Jim Mattis six months to come up with a policy on "how to address" those who are currently serving.A Pentagon spokesman, Mark Wright, said the Tuesday ruling will have no impact on current Defense Department policy."As directed by the DoD guidance, no action may be taken to involuntarily separate or discharge an otherwise qualified service member solely on the basis of a gender dysphoria diagnosis or transgender status," Wright said.The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against the proposed ban in September, cheered the Tuesday ruling. The lawsuit reviewed by the Baltimore judge was filed by the ACLU on behalf of six transgender members of the armed forces."Today is a victory for transgender service members across the country," senior ACLU staff attorney Joshua Block said in a statement. "We\'re pleased that the courts have stepped in to ensure that trans service members are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve."The proposed ban remains unenforceable under the preliminary injunctions.The Trump administration\'s transgender ban was also being argued in federal court in Seattle on Tuesday in a case brought by gay rights group Lambda Legal, with a judge grilling a Justice Department lawyer over the president\'s intent and over how his directive has already affected transgender troops.___Associated Press writers Robert Burns and Jessica Gresko in Washington and Gene Johnson in Seattle contributed to this report.David McFadden on Twitter: www.twitter.com/dmcfadd', 'Operative Offered Trump Campaign ‘Kremlin Connection’ Using N.R.A. Ties - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — A conservative operative trumpeting his close ties to the National Rifle Association and Russia told a Trump campaign adviser last year that he could arrange a back-channel meeting between Donald J. Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, according to an email sent to the Trump campaign.A May 2016 email to the campaign adviser, Rick Dearborn, bore the subject line “Kremlin Connection.” In it, the N.R.A. member said he wanted the advice of Mr. Dearborn and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, then a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump and Mr. Dearborn’s longtime boss, about how to proceed in connecting the two leaders.Russia, he wrote, was “quietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the U.S.” and would attempt to use the N.R.A.’s annual convention in Louisville, Ky., to make “ ‘first contact.’ ” The email, which was among a trove of campaign-related documents turned over to investigators on Capitol Hill, was described in detail to The New York Times.Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign, secured a guilty plea on Friday from President Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, for lying to the F.B.I. about contacts with Moscow’s former ambassador to the United States. But those contacts came after Mr. Trump’s improbable election victory.The emailed outreach from the conservative operative to Mr. Dearborn came far earlier, around the same time that Russians were trying to make other connections to the Trump campaign. Another contact came through an American advocate for Christian and veterans causes, and together, the outreach shows how, as Mr. Trump closed in on the nomination, Russians were using three foundational pillars of the Republican Party — guns, veterans and Christian conservatives — to try to make contact with his unorthodox campaign.Both efforts, made within days of each other, centered on the N.R.A.’s annual meeting and appear to involve Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of the Russian central bank and key figure in Mr. Putin’s United Russia party, who was instructed to make contact with the campaign.“Putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,” the N.R.A. member and conservative activist, Paul Erickson, wrote. “He wants to extend an invitation to Mr. Trump to visit him in the Kremlin before the election. Let’s talk through what has transpired and Senator Sessions’s advice on how to proceed.”It is not clear how Mr. Dearborn handled the outreach. He forwarded a similar proposal, made through Rick Clay, an advocate for conservative Christian causes, to Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and a top campaign aide. Mr. Kushner rebuffed the proposal at the time, according to two people who have seen Mr. Kushner’s email.Mr. Sessions told investigators from the House Intelligence Committee that he did not recall the outreach, according to three people with knowledge of the exchange. Mr. Dearborn did not return requests for comment, and Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer dealing with matters related to the investigations, declined to comment. Repeated attempts to reach Mr. Erickson were not successful.Intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia, on orders from the highest levels of its government, undertook a sophisticated campaign to hack Democratic computers, spread propaganda and undermine the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. The repeated outreach around the N.R.A. convention, where Mr. Trump accepted the group’s endorsement, came just weeks after a self-described intermediary for the Russian government told George Papadopoulos, a campaign aide, that the Russians had “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton. And just weeks later, the president’s eldest son arranged a meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information about the would-be Democratic nominee.“The Kremlin believes that the only possibility of a true reset in this relationship would be with a new Republican White House,” Mr. Erickson wrote to Mr. Dearborn, adding, “Ever since Hillary compared Putin to Hitler, all senior Russian leaders consider her beyond redemption.”Congressional investigators obtained the email as part of their inquiry into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether Mr. Trump’s campaign aided the efforts. It appears to have caught the attention of senators as well. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, penned letters to several Trump campaign foreign policy advisers last week asking for all documents related to the N.R.A., Mr. Erickson, Mr. Torshin, Mr. Clay, Mr. Dearborn and others.Mr. Erickson, a longtime conservative operative who has been involved in several presidential campaigns, presented himself in the email as a well-connected intermediary to the upper reaches of the Russian government. By “happenstance” and the reach of the N.R.A., Mr. Erickson wrote, he had been put in position to “slowly begin cultivating a back-channel to President Putin’s Kremlin” in recent years.“Russia is quietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the U.S. that isn’t forthcoming under the current administration,” he wrote.Indeed, evidence does appear to show deep ties between Mr. Erickson, the N.R.A. and the Russian gun rights community that were formed in the years when many American conservatives, put off by the Obama administration’s policies, were increasingly looking to Mr. Putin as an example of a strong leader opposing immigration, terrorism and gay rights.The N.R.A. was one of Mr. Trump’s biggest backers during the campaign, spending tens of millions of dollars to help elect him.Mr. Erickson has known Maria Butina, a former assistant to Mr. Torshin and the founder of the Right to Bear Arms, a Russian gun-rights group, for several years. Ms. Butina, who helped Mr. Torshin make the request through Mr. Clay, hosted Mr. Erickson at a September 2014 meeting of the group at its Moscow office. And in February 2016, the two incorporated a company, Bridges LLC, together in South Dakota. What the company does is unclear.In December 2015, Mr. Erickson returned to Russia as part of an N.R.A. delegation that included David Keene, the group’s onetime president, top donors and David A. Clarke Jr., the former sheriff of Milwaukee County who became a popular Trump campaign surrogate. At one stop, the group met with Dmitry Rogozin, the deputy prime minister in charge of defense. A photograph from the meeting shows Mr. Torshin was also present.In the United States, the hospitality was returned. Mr. Torshin and Ms. Butina attended the N.R.A.’s annual convention in 2014 and 2015. Ms. Butina told the conservative news site Townhall that she attended the N.R.A. Women’s Leadership Luncheon as a guest of Sandra S. Froman, a former president of the group. And in 2015, she was given a tour of the N.R.A.’s Virginia headquarters.Attempts to contact Ms. Butina were unsuccessful.Mr. Erickson does not explicitly name Mr. Torshin in the email to Mr. Dearborn, but the message appears to refer to him, the people familiar with the communication said. Instead, he describes “President Putin’s emissary on this front,” whose plans match those of Mr. Torshin.Mr. Torshin, he wrote, was planning to attend a reception being planned by Mr. Clay honoring wounded veterans that he expected Mr. Trump would also attend. Mr. Torshin expected to use the reception to “make ‘first contact’ ” with the candidate and present Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, with a gift from the Russian Orthodox Church.According to Mr. Clay, neither Mr. Trump nor his campaign officials attended the veterans’ dinner. The president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and Mr. Torshin did attend a separate N.R.A. dinner that night.Mr. Torshin served in the upper house of the Russian Parliament and was a member of the country’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee, a government body that includes the ministers of defense, interior and foreign affairs and the director of the Federal Security Service, known as F.S.B., the K.G.B.’s successor. He has been a leading advocate of gun rights in Russia and of more closely linking the government and the Russian Orthodox Church.Spanish investigators say that while he was in Parliament, Mr. Torshin laundered money for the Russian mafia through Spanish banks and properties. Mr. Torshin has denied those accusations.', 'WASHINGTON – Defying dire, worldwide warnings, President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke with decades of U.S. and international policy and formally recognized Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital.Despite urgent appeals from Arab and European leaders and the risk of anti-American protests and violence, Trump declared it was time for a new approach to Mideast peace after decades of failure. Calling Jerusalem Israel\'s capital, he argued, was merely recognizing the obvious."We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past," the president said.He also said the U.S. would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable.Ahead of Trump\'s speech, a wide array of world leaders warned that his declaration could severely damage Arab-Israeli peace prospects in a region wracked by instability. They said recognizing Israel\'s claims to the city, however caveated, would infuriate Muslims and potentially spark protests and violence that might further fray American alliances.In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his nation was "profoundly grateful" and Trump\'s announcement was an "important step toward peace."However, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Wednesday that the U.S. shift "is a declaration of withdrawal from the role it has played in the peace process."In Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian protesters burned American and Israeli flags. They also waved Palestinian flags and banners proclaiming Jerusalem as their "eternal capital," language that Israelis similarly use. Even America\'s closest allies in Europe questioned the wisdom of Trump\'s departure from the past U.S. position, which was studiously neutral over the sovereignty of the city."I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel," Trump said in a White House address, calling his decision "overdue" and in America\'s best interests. "This is nothing more or less than the recognition of reality," he said.Trump made no reference to signing a waiver that officials said he would sign delaying any move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Establishing a Jerusalem embassy was a major campaign promise of Trump\'s and one that officials said he had focused on in discussions with top advisers in recent weeks. The waiver means there will be no embassy move for at least another six months.Instead, Trump stressed that he directed the State Department begin the process of moving the embassy as required by U.S. law, however many years that might take. After his speech, he signed a proclamation to that effect.The Trump administration has opted against an earlier plan of converting the existing U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem to an embassy, said a non-governmental expert on the Middle East who consults regularly with the White House. Instead, it\'s looking to construct an entirely new facility over the long term and a U.S. team is examining prospective sites in Jerusalem, said the individual, who wasn\'t authorized to disclose private conversations with U.S. officials and requested anonymity.There was little in Trump\'s statement to encourage the Palestinians. Although he recited the longstanding U.S. position that Jerusalem\'s borders must still be worked out through negotiation, he made no recognition of the Palestinian claims to east Jerusalem. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was expected to deliver a statement later Wednesday after consulting fellow Arab leaders.While Trump for the first time endorsed the concept of an independent Palestine existing alongside Israel, even that idea appeared conditional. He said he would promote the "two-state solution" if both sides agree. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\'s government is dominated by hardliners who oppose Palestinian independence.Trump\'s declaration of Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital is a powerful symbolic step. The United States has never endorsed the Jewish state\'s claim of sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem and has seen the city\'s future as indelibly linked to a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace agreement. Trump\'s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been trying to restart a new peace process.In making his decision, Trump overruled more cautious counsel from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, who expressed concern about endangering U.S. diplomats and troops in Muslim countries, according to officials briefed on internal administration deliberations. Those officials were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity."There will of course be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement — but we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a place of greater understanding and cooperation," Trump said. He said he intends "to do everything in my power to help forge" a peace agreement.Jerusalem includes the holiest ground in Judaism. It\'s also home to Islam\'s third-holiest shrine and major Christian sites, and any perceived harm to Muslim claims to the city has triggered protests in the past, in the Holy Land and beyond. On Tuesday, America\'s consulate in Jerusalem ordered U.S. personnel and their families to avoid visiting Jerusalem\'s Old City or the West Bank, and urged American citizens in general to stay away from places with increased police or military presence.Saudi Arabia\'s King Salman, one of several Arab leaders to speak to Trump this week, warned the U.S. leader Tuesday that declaring Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital "would constitute a flagrant provocation to all Muslims, all over the world." Abbas and Jordan\'s King Abdullah II said they told Trump specifically not to move the embassy. British Prime Minister Theresa May said she planned to call Trump to discuss her country\'s support for a two-state solution.Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian official, said Wednesday that Trump\'s recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital means "the peace process is finished" because Washington "has already pre-empted the outcome." Now, she said, "there is no way that there can be talks with the Americans."___Associated Press writers Josef Federman in Jerusalem; Karin Laub in Amman, Jordan; Josh Lederman in Brussels; Matthew Pennington and Bradley Klapper in Washington; Elaine Ganley in Paris; Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, and Aya Batrawy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.', 'Trump and Flynn and Billy Bush - The New York TimesTo the Editor:Re “Trump Condemns F.B.I. and Comey as Inquiry Grows” (front page, Dec. 4):While the most visible culprit in this continuing train wreck of an administration is Donald Trump, equally complicit are the Republicans.To have the Federal Bureau of Investigation, one of our most stalwart, respected and relied-upon agencies, denigrated without a shred of legitimate substantiation is beyond disgraceful.

Comey, the F.B.I. director; what measures will he now take under much more dire threat? How will the public, public institutions and the media react to his actions?And how will this president with deeply authoritarian tendencies respond to resistance, such as by imposing restraints on the press and public assembly?I don’t think my scenario is the product of paranoid delusion. Donald Trump is a president unlike any who have held the office and from whom no behavior, no matter how unprecedented or unlawful, can be ruled out.DAVID SIROTA, NEW YORK', 'Trump, Taxes and … You Know - The New York TimesEverybody’s talking about taxes this week. Big Republican bill is coming out of the oven. Attention must be paid. Feel free to ask questions.Is it true that Donald Trump Jr. stole his kid’s Halloween candy?Don Jr. tweeted that he was going to take half of his daughter Chloe’s candy and give it to “some kid who sat at home. It’s never to early to teach her about socialism.”The most important thing about that tweet is that Junior misspelled “too.” His dad does that a lot. However, he also seemed to be talking about redistribution of wealth, so I guess it’s fair game for a tax conversation. Except that this is not the right moment to pick on Junior. His mother, Ivana, published a memoir recently that makes it clear this guy had one of the worst childhoods this side of Oliver Twist. His father didn’t want him named Donald Jr. in case he turned into a “loser.” He had to call Ivana in Florida to report he’d found his nanny unconscious in the basement. While he was in school, his father was having a torrid affair that was headlined in the tabloids every single day.So leave Donald Jr. alone. He had a weird upbringing. And maybe 20 years from now, we’ll offer the same sort of amnesty to Chloe. Meantime, about the taxes … Does Donald Trump think tax cuts will be his big first-year moment?For a president, every day is a new challenge to rise to the occasion. If, for instance, a terrorist assault hits an American city, he will want to quickly bring the people together by attacking the city’s U.S. senator and claiming the nation’s system of justice is “a joke.”So while taxes are of course a big presidential priority, it isn’t everything. Whoa, you’re sounding a little bitter there. Sorry. We are talking about taxes and I am not going to be diverted. Just because we have a president who once attempted to give the impression he had visited ground zero on 9/11. Which he referred to as “7/11.”We’re talking revenue here. Let’s get to it. Give me something I can say about taxes that will sound very smart when I have dinner with my relatives over the holidays.I recommend, “What ever happened to carried interest?” That’s a tax loophole much beloved by Wall Street investment managers. Which Donald Trump attacked during the campaign. (“They are paper-pushers. They make a fortune. They pay no tax. It’s ridiculous, O.K.?”)Then, not a word … Wall Street investment managers pay no tax?They generally pay about 20 percent. Which, as Hillary Clinton often pointed out, is less than a lot of nurses pay on their salaries. Poor Hillary Clinton. Sometimes she’d give little lectures at her campaign rallies explaining how carried interest worked so her supporters could understand the details … I am not going to talk about Hillary Clinton with my relatives at dinner. It leads to sobbing and ruined appetites. Sorry. The carried interest reform wasn’t in the initial administration tax proposal, but the White House economic adviser, Gary Cohn, claimed Trump was committed to it. This was the same Gary Cohn who suggested that a $1,000 tax cut would enable average Americans to “buy a new car.”Basically, Donald Trump’s most progressive proposal for taxes seems to have fallen by the wayside. Like an abandoned kitten or the release of his own personal tax returns. The Republicans are always talking about repealing the estate tax. Isn’t that just for superrich people?Well, it is true that estates don’t get taxed unless they’re worth more than $5.95 million, or $10.9 million for a couple. And it is also true that most people with that amount of money have already figured out ways to minimize the bill. And special cases like family-owned farms have been given lots of protections.But getting rid of the estate tax is still an important point of honor for many Republicans. Somewhere tonight there’s a child with a $30 million inheritance who needs our help.What’s the tax cut schedule? Is it happening soon?The House leaders have been flailing away for some time, trying to figure out how to give breaks to corporations, estates worth more than $11 million and people in the top income bracket without making it look as though they’re doing favors for rich people.And that’s actually the easy part. After the House, the Senate Republicans have to come up with a plan that will please 50 members of their party, several of whom regard the president as slightly less inspirational than shingles. I don’t see why we need to talk about taxes now. Nothing will happen for ages. There hasn’t even been a hearing.That’s really sweet of you, imagining there’d be hearings. Congress doesn’t have public deliberation while it’s preparing big bills any more. It’s totally not Age of Trump.Almost as out of date as the idea that a president should call the mayor of a city that’s suffered a terrorist attack on the same day it happened.', 'Strategy Room: Christopher Hale and Kevin McCullough on how the White House will try to convince Congress to back his planAs President Trump takes to Twitter to assail foes and tackle trolls, he can add another nemesis to his list: former Mexican President Vicente Fox.Fox, 75, who served as president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006, has launched a mock 2020 presidential campaign against the sitting U.S. president.In a series of anti-Trump tweets and videos, Fox addresses myriad issues affecting the American people.In a video released Sept. 7, Fox, calling Trump “last year’s rotting Halloween pumpkin,” says: "Donald, every time I make fun of you, which I do a lot, people say, \'Why can\'t you be our president?\' America, I feel your pain. We all do. And that is why today I am proud to announce my candidacy for president of the United States."\'I am proud to announce my candidacy for president of the United States.\'The five-minute video opens with Fox wearing a hat with a vulgar expression, features him holding up his middle finger at times and introduces his campaign mascot: a goat wearing two signs: “Vicente for Presidente!” and “A taco truck on every corner!” The clip also shows a mariachi band crooning about Trump.Fox adds, “if that worn-out baseball glove tightly gripping a turd can be president, then amigos, anyone can.” And “Donald, you suck so much at this job.”Trump seems unaffected by Fox’s trolling. The last time the president tweeted about Fox was on Aug. 31, 2016: “Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the f-bomb.”Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the "f bomb."Fox has repeatedly used the “f-bomb” when blasting Trump’s proposed U.S-Mexico border wall.Shortly after Trump’s inauguration in January, Fox, in another video viewed more than 2 million times, takes on Trump’s wall promise. Fox is shown holding up a sign reading “Mexico will not pay,” then quickly flips it to show, “for the f----- wall.”Continuing to directly address President Trump, Fox challenges “the experts” who say building a wall “would work.” He then launches into a diatribe on how he downloaded a schematic from the dark web that will negate Trump’s wall plans: “It is a ladder, Einstein,” Fox says, while holding a crude drawing of a ladder against a brick wall.“You’re going to build a $25 billion wall that can be defeated by a $25 ladder?” Fox asks. “Be honest, Donald. This wall isn’t going to stop anyone who really wants to cross the border.”Canada, don’t let that moron stop our entire region from thriving. Our well-being is a three way deal. We’re #StrongerTogether, remember?The Super Deluxe videos are reminiscent of skits seen on late-night talk shows.Referring to Trump as a “false prophet,” Fox also slams the president via Twitter on a host of issues, including: ● The U.S. response to Puerto Rico – “They don’t need more of your face nor your words, they need effective aid” and “Puerto Ricans have been American citizens since 1917: true or false? Get it right and earn a toilet paper.”.@realDonaldTrump, you\'re obsessed with Mexico! What have we done to you? One thing is straight: Mexico won\'t negotiate over Twitter.● Gun control – “American people must not be looking over their shoulder for their countrymen”● North Korea – “instigating and provoking war? You better learn diplomacy instead of using the 280 characters”● Vice President Pence’s decision to leave an NFL game when players kneeled during the national anthem – “Pence’s visit to the stadium wasn’t about patriotism, it’s about being so stubborn to prove your point.”', '', "Trump campaign aides charged in special counsel's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.'Monday was not a good day for President Trump, but it was an even worse day for Hillary Clinton. Indictments handed down by Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged Trump’s former campaign chair Paul Manafort and close associate Rick Gates with a slew of white collar crimes, including failure to register as a foreign agent, tax evasion and money laundering, an embarrassment to the president. But, some have described the indictments as weak, since they focus on Manafort making false FARA filings, or not registering as a foreign agent, a charge brought by the government only six times since 1966, and which resulted in only one conviction. Enforcement of the FARA law is generally not rigorous.More important, there was no mention of Russia, or of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Hillary needs Mueller to connect those dots.In Hillary’s world, she campaigned admirably and had the better message; it was Moscow that did her in.Also released Monday was news that a Trump campaign volunteer, George Papadopoulos pled guilty Oct. 5 to lying to federal agents. Papadopoulos was brought aboard the campaign as an expert on Greece, but promoted various unsuccessful attempts to set up a meeting between Donald Trump and Putin. None of his efforts bore fruit; emails suggest he was rebuffed by senior members of the campaign on several occasions. Nonetheless, his plea is viewed as potentially damaging to the Trump camp, since language in the indictment suggests he may have acted as a cooperating witness; in other words, he may have been persuaded in recent months to wear a wire. As someone pretty far down the food chain, it is unclear what information he might provide.None of this will satisfy Secretary Clinton’s desire to blame Vladimir Putin for her astonishing loss to an untutored and underfinanced Donald Trump. She has written extensively about the suspicious regard that Trump voiced for the Kremlin leader during the election, and of the numerous points of contact between members of the Trump entourage and suspected Russian operatives. In Hillary’s world, she campaigned admirably and had the better message; it was Moscow that did her in.That narrative took a hit in recent days as proof emerged that the Clinton campaign itself had indirectly paid Russian sources millions of dollars for salacious and discredited material on Donald Trump. The Clintonistas and the DNC hired Fusion GPS to assemble the notorious Trump dossier, which was created by former British spy Christopher Steele with the apparent help of Kremlin-linked informants.It also came to light recently that the Obama White House was aware of a wide-ranging FBI investigation into Russian efforts to secure uranium reserves in the U.S., involving bribery and racketeering that took place during the early years of the Obama administration.During the same period, Russian interests mysteriously donated millions to a Canadian affiliate of the Clinton Foundation, which Hillary failed to report, and a Moscow bank with ties to Putin also paid Bill Clinton half a million dollars for a speech. In 2010 she, along with the heads of other agencies represented on the CFIUS panel, green-lighted the sale of Uranium One to Russia's Atomic Energy Agency,Rosatom, against the recommendation of national security advisors.Americans are left to wonder…was it Trump that colluded with Russia, or was it Hillary? Did Putin pick sides, or was he out mainly to destabilize our body politic? If it was the latter, he has succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.The investigation into Russian meddling has become a political football, with Democrats using allegations of collusion to discredit Trump’s extraordinary win. Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Mark Warner – they are all-in on the Trump-Russia meme, and notably silent on the recent developments noted above.Meanwhile, the tens of millions of Americans who voted for Donald Trump are angry that his victory has been met with steadfast resistance and obstruction. Democrats (and some Republicans) have thrown up endless roadblocks, among other things delaying the staffing of vital government posts and hindering efforts to fix our collapsing health care system. Trump supporters question the integrity of the FBI, which apparently also paid Fusion GPS, the impartiality of the Mueller investigation and have long since tuned out the biased liberal media.None of this is good for our country. Which is why the sooner the Mueller investigation comes to an end the better. Despite all the sturm und drang about Russian collusion and the dire warnings of Trump incompetence or worse, Americans are the most upbeat they have been in decades, the stock market is soaring and the economy is showing every sign of accelerating.This good news appalls Democrats, who still lack a coherent message that can compete with a strengthening economy. A rising tide tends to lift all boats and drown out the left’s politics of envy; what else do they have?Hillary, in particular, has only excuses. She will continue to hope for proof positive that Donald Trump’s victory was not a victory for putting America first, for strengthening our military, for reestablishing the rule of law and tightening our borders, for rolling back regulations of businesses and making our tax code simpler and fairer. She needs Robert Mueller to prove Trump’s win illegitimate, and the handiwork of Russia.Hillary and her fellow Democrats want the suffocating cloud of suspicion to linger, and, given the enormous resources that Mueller has assembled, they will probably get their wish.Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

(Reuters)                                                                    ANKARA, Turkey – The United States will cut off its supply of arms to Kurdish fighters in Syria, President Donald Trump told the Turkish president on Friday, in a move sure to please Turkey but further alienate Syrian Kurds who bore much of the fight against the Islamic State group.In a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Trump said he’d “given clear instructions” that the Kurds will receive no more weapons — “and that this nonsense should have ended a long time ago,” said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.The White House confirmed the move in a cryptic statement about the phone call that said Trump had informed the Turk of “pending adjustments to the military support provided to our partners on the ground in Syria.”The White House called the move “consistent with our previous policy” and noted the recent fall of Raqqa, once the Islamic State group’s self-declared capital but recently liberated by a largely Kurdish force. The Trump administration announced in May it would start arming the Kurds in anticipation of the fight to retake Raqqa.“We are progressing into a stabilization phase to ensure that ISIS cannot return,” the White House said, using an acronym for the extremist group.The move could help ease strained tensions between the U.S. and Turkey, two NATO allies that have been sharply at odds about how best to wage the fight against IS. Turkey considers the Kurdish Syrian fighters, known by the initials YPG, to be terrorists because of their affiliation to outlawed Kurdish rebels that have waged a three decade-long insurgency in Turkey. Yet the U.S. chose to partner with the YPG in Syria anyway, arguing that the battle-hardened Kurds were the most effective fighting force available.Cavusoglu, who said he was in the room with Erdogan during Trump’s call, quoted the U.S. president as saying he had given instructions to U.S. generals and to national security adviser H.R. McMaster that “no weapons would be issued.”“Of course, we were very happy with this,” Cavusoglu said.Yet for the Kurds, it was the latest demoralizing blow to their hopes for greater recognition in the region. Last month, the Kurds in neighboring Iraq saw their recent territorial gains erased by the Iraqi military, which seized the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and other disputed areas from the Kurdish regional government in retaliation for a Kurdish independence referendum that the U.S. ardently opposed.Trump’s decision appeared to catch both the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department off guard. Officials at both agencies, who would normally be informed of changes in U.S. policy toward arming the Syrian Kurds, said they were unaware of any changes. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.It was unclear whether the Trump administration notified the Kurds of the move before telling the Turks. Nor was it how much significance the change would have on the ground, considering the fight against IS is almost over.The United States has been arming the Kurds in their fight against IS through an umbrella group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which is comprised of Kurdish as well as Arab fighters.But the retreat of IS, which has lost nearly all its territory in Syria, has altered the dynamics in the region and a U.S. defense official said he was unaware of any additional arms scheduled to be transferred to the Kurds, even before the Turkish announcement.Last week, Col. Ryan Dillon, the chief spokesman for the U.S. coalition that is fighting IS in Iraq and Syria, said there has yet to be any reduction in the number of U.S. advisers working with the SDF. His comments appeared to suggest the possibility that changes in the level and type of U.S. military support for the Syrian Kurds could be coming.As the fight against IS has waned in recent months, the U.S. has pledged to carefully monitor the weapons it provides the Kurds, notably ensuring that they don’t wind up in the hands of Kurdish insurgents in Turkey known as the PKK.Both Turkey and the U.S. consider the PKK a terrorist group. But the United States has tried to draw a distinction between the PKK and the Syrian Kurds across the border, while Turkey insists they’re essentially the same.In both Syria and Iraq, the U.S. relied on Kurdish fighters to do much of the fighting against IS, but those efforts have yet to lead to a realization of the Kurds’ broader aspirations, most notably an independent state.Washington’s support for the Syrian Kurds, in particular, has been a major thorn in U.S.-Turkish relations for several years, given Turkey’s concerns about the Kurds’ territorial aspirations. In particular, Turkey has feared the establishment of a contiguous, Kurdish-held canton in northern Syria that runs along the Turkish border.Relations between NATO allies Turkey and the United States have also soured recently over a number of other issues, including Turkey’s crackdown on dissent following a failed coup attempt last year.Ankara has also demanded that the U.S. extradite a Pennsylvania-based cleric that it blames for fomenting the coup, but the U.S. says Turkey lacks sufficient proof.Lederman reported from Washington.

Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI about contacts with Russia\'s ambassador.But stocks recouped the bulk of their initial losses, after U.S. Senate Republicans said they had enough support to pass a sweeping tax overhaul.The Senate news was the latest sign of progress for a tax bill being closely watched by investors, with hopes that significant corporate tax cuts will further fuel Wall Street\'s record-setting rally.“This Flynn thing threw everything for a loop. We had that still against the backdrop of tax reform,” said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.“We are at all-time highs so sometimes when you do get news that’s of a nature where people want to sell, it gets a little bit overdone,” Kinahan said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40.76 points, or 0.17 percent, to 24,231.59, the S&P 500 lost 5.36 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,642.22 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.39 points, or 0.38 percent, to 6,847.59.Steep sell-offs have been a rarity on Wall Street this year. The S&P 500 has closed down by at least 1 percent only four times in 2017.Progress with the tax legislation in the Senate had helped buoy stocks this week, as well as drive a rotation into those areas that seem poised to benefit from lower corporate taxes."We\'ve kind of had a slow-growth economy in the last 18 to 24 months. The market piled into the faster-growing companies out there," said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital in Dallas."Now we have an economy that\'s accelerated in growth...A lot of the stocks that have been ignored in the last couple of years could become bargains," Bradshaw said.The S&P has rallied 18 percent this year, boosted by solid global economic data and strong U.S. corporate earnings. But with investors optimistic about some aspects of Trump\'s domestic agenda, especially tax cuts, news involving his administration has periodically rattled markets."We\'ve kind of gotten used to the drama in the White House," said Rob Stein, CEO of Astor Investment Management in Chicago. "Whether or not they prove that there are Russian relationship ties, that doesn\'t have a long-term effect on the value of the stock market."Indeed, the initial abrupt selloff prompted Wall Street\'s favorite reaction in recent months: "Buy the dip."Energy was the best-performing sector, rising 0.8 percent.

And we laughed along, without a single doubt that this was hypothetical hot air from America’s highest-rated bloviator. Along with Donald Trump and me, there were seven other guys present on the bus at the time, and every single one of us assumed we were listening to a crass standup act. He was performing. Surely, we thought, none of this was real.We now know better.Recently I sat down and read an article dating from October of 2016; it was published days after my departure from NBC, a time when I wasn’t processing anything productively. In it, the author reviewed the various firsthand accounts about Mr. Trump that, at that point, had come from 20 women.Some of what Natasha Stoynoff, Rachel Crooks, Jessica Leeds and Jill Harth alleged involved forceful kissing. Ms. Harth said he pushed her up against a wall, with his hands all over her, trying to kiss her.“He was relentless,” she said. “I didn’t know how to handle it.” Her story makes the whole “better use some Tic Tacs” and “just start kissing them” routine real. I believe her.Kristin Anderson said that Mr. Trump reached under her skirt and “touched her vagina through her underwear” while they were at a New York nightclub in the 1990s. That makes the “grab ’em by the pussy” routine real. I believe her.President Trump is currently indulging in some revisionist history, reportedly telling allies, including at least one United States senator, that the voice on the tape is not his. This has hit a raw nerve in me.I can only imagine how it has reopened the wounds of the women who came forward with their stories about him, and did not receive enough attention. This country is currently trying to reconcile itself to years of power abuse and sexual misconduct. Its leader is wantonly poking the bear.In 2005, I was in my first full year as a co-anchor of the show “Access Hollywood” on NBC. Mr. Trump, then on “The Apprentice,” was the network’s biggest star.The key to succeeding in my line of work was establishing a strong rapport with celebrities. I did that, and was rewarded for it. My segments with Donald Trump when I was just a correspondent were part of the reason I got promoted.NBC tripled my salary and paid for my moving van from New York to Los Angeles.Was I acting out of self-interest? You bet I was. Was I alone? Far from it. With Mr. Trump’s outsized viewership back in 2005, everybody from Billy Bush on up to the top brass on the 52nd floor had to stroke the ego of the big cash cow along the way to higher earnings.None of us were guilty of knowingly enabling our future president. But all of us were guilty of sacrificing a bit of ourselves in the name of success.Ten years later, I did speak up. Soon after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy, I let it be known on “Access Hollywood Live” that I thought this was an absurd idea.In the days, weeks and months to follow, I was highly critical of the idea of a Trump presidency. The man who once told me — ironically, in another off-camera conversation — after I called him out for inflating his ratings: “People will just believe you. You just tell them and they believe you,” was, I thought, not a good choice to lead our country.I tried to conduct a serious interview with him as a candidate; each time I requested one I was turned down.This moment in American life is no doubt painful for many women. It is especially painful for the women who have come forward, at the risk of forever being linked to one event, this man, this president of the United States. (I still can’t believe I just wrote that.)To these women: I will never know the fear you felt or the frustration of being summarily dismissed and called a liar, but I do know a lot about the anguish of being inexorably linked to Donald Trump. You have my respect and admiration. You are culture warriors at the forefront of necessary change.I have faith that when the hard work of exposing these injustices is over, the current media drama of who did what to whom will give way to a constructive dialogue between mature men and women in the workplace and beyond. The activist and gender-relations expert Jackson Katz has said that this is not a women’s issue — it’s a men’s issue. That’s a great place to start, and something I have real thoughts about — but it is a story for another day.Today is about reckoning and reawakening, and I hope it reaches all the guys on the bus.On a personal note, this last year has been an odyssey, the likes of which I hope to never face again: anger, anxiety, betrayal, humiliation, many selfish but, I hope, understandable emotions. But these have given way to light, both spiritual and intellectual. It’s been fortifying.I know that I don’t need the accouterments of fame to know God and be happy. After everything over the last year, I think I’m a better man and father to my three teenage daughters — far from perfect, but better.', "Eric Shawn reports from the United Nations on the president's first address to the General AssemblyEditor's note: The following column first appeared in The Washington Post.When Donald Trump ran for president, he criticized the interventionist policies of his Republican and Democratic predecessors, sparking fears that he would usher in a new era of American isolationism. But at the U.N. this week, Trump laid out a clear conservative vision for vigorous American global leadership based on the principle of state sovereignty.President Donald Trump speaks during the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters, Tuesday, Sept. 19, 2017.(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)Judging from their hysterical reaction, critics on the left now seem to fear he’s the second coming of George W. Bush. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called his address “bombastic.” Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said it represented an “abdication of values.” And Hillary Clinton said it was“very dark” and “dangerous.”This is all the standard liberal critique of conservative internationalism. The left said much the same about President Ronald Reagan.In New York, Trumpcalled onresponsible nation-states to join the United States in taking on what he called the “scourge” of “a small group of rogue regimes that .\u2009.\u2009. respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries.” This mission can be accomplished, Trump said, only if we recognize that “the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.”President Donald Trump addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., September 19, 2017. (REUTERS/Lucas Jackson)He is right. Communism and fascism were not defeated by the United Nations, and global institutions did not fuel the dramatic expansion of human freedom and prosperity in the past quarter-century since the collapse of the Soviet Union. What has inspired and enabled the spread of peace, democracy and individual liberty was the principled projection of power by the world’s democratic countries, led by the United States.This is what is needed today — and what Trump promised in his address. He recast his “America First” foreign policy as a call not for isolationism but for global leadership by responsible nation-states. He embraced the Marshall Plan — the massive U.S. effort to support Europe’s postwar recovery. And he declared that “if the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph” because “when decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.”Trump then used this theme of sovereignty to challenge the United States’ two greatest geopolitical adversaries, China and Russia, insisting that “we must reject threats to sovereignty from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.”The president also had a blunt message for North Korea. He dismissed its leader, Kim Jong Un, as “Rocket Man” and said Kim “is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.” He made clear that “the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” This message rattled some, and that was its intent. During the Cold War, Soviet leaders truly believed that Reagan was preparing for war and might actually launch a first strike. This belief is one of the reasons that a cataclysmic war never took place.President Donald Trump addresses the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly, at U.N. headquarters, Tuesday, Sept. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)If we hope to avoid war with North Korea today, the regime in Pyongyang must be made to believe and understand that Trump is in fact, as he said at the U.N., “ready, willing and able” to take military action. His tough rhetoric was aimed not just at Pyongyang but also at China and other states whose cooperation in squeezing the regime is necessary for a peaceful solution. Those words must be followed by concrete steps short of total destruction to make clear that he is indeed serious and that North Korea will not be permitted to threaten American cites with nuclear annihilation.Trump also put himself squarely on the side of morality in foreign policy and explicitly stood with those seeking freedom around the world. He promised to support the “enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom.” He declared that “oppressive regimes cannot endure forever” and upbraided the Iranian regime for masking “a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy” while promising to stand with “the good people of Iran [who] want change.” He took on Iran’s ally, “the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad” in Syria, whose “use of chemical weapons against his own citizens, even innocent children, shock the conscience of every decent person.”And his best moment came when he turned to what he called the “socialist dictatorship” of Nicolás Maduro, declaring that “the problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented.” Trump promised to help the Venezuelan people “regain their freedom, recover their country and restore their democracy.”This is classic conservative internationalism: a vigorous defense of freedom, a bold challenge to dangerous dictators and a commitment to the principle of peace through strength. No wonder Trump’s critics on the left are so upset.Marc Thiessen is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI).Thiessen served as chief speechwriter to President George W. Bush and to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.", 'Trump Took Office. Stocks Rose. Investors Are Still Worried. - The New York TimesSome of President Trump’s least controversial tweets involve him boasting about the stock market. It has certainly done well since he was elected a year ago, with the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 30 percent in that time.On Thursday, the Dow hit a milestone when it closed above 24,000 for the first time, prompting Mr. Trump to take to Twitter again. “Stock Market hits new Record High. Confidence and enthusiasm abound,” he wrote. “More great numbers coming out!”Few would have predicted a year ago that the market would do so well. Investors who had the fortitude to stay in have benefited mightily by the increase. But the wary ones put their money in more secure assets.Right before Mr. Trump was elected, I wrote a column on what a Trump presidency would mean for the economy. Most of the people I interviewed were nervous, and they were making defensive moves in their investments — away from equities and into hard assets like real estate — or putting plans in place to weather a downturn.Michael Sonnenfeldt, a New Yorker who made his fortune in real estate, is the chairman of Tiger 21, an investment club for very wealthy people. When I talked to him last year, he revealed the uncertainty investors were facing.“The combination of potential interest rate shocks and a China implosion and the geopolitical situations with Russia, China, Iran, the Middle East, ISIS, and the difficult political situation in the U.S. with the most challenging, strangest presidential election we’ve had in our lifetime — it all adds up to many generic concerns,” he said at the time.So how did the market rocket past expectations, and how should investors plan for 2018?Mr. Trump is not unique among presidents for taking credit for a strong stock market and the broader economy. Most do it, if they can — just as surely as they try to skirt responsibility when there is a slump.But the last 12 months of great returns lack the euphoria a person might expect after an increase in the Dow of nearly 30 percent.Advisers say that is because many individual investors remain afraid that the eight-year bull market is going to collapse, while others struggle to separate Mr. Trump’s harsh political language from the strong fundamentals of American companies.Individual investors are still seeking safe havens. One measure is bond funds, assets that help defend against a downturn. According to Yardeni Research, money continues to flow into bond funds.“We’ve had a year of record-low volatility, strong returns and strong macroeconomic indicators,” said Michael O’Sullivan, chief investment officer for international wealth management at Credit Suisse. “But politically — we’re in a political recession. People have difficulty squaring the two.”The firm’s global wealth report, released in November, showed that the world had grown wealthier in the last 12 months and not just at the top of the economic pyramid.“The markets are focused very much on the business cycle, which is picking up,” Mr. O’Sullivan said. “That’s been a positive surprise, given how badly many people would have said the economy would have fared.”In other words, the stock market is rising not because of Mr. Trump but in spite of him.“Our view continues to be that politicians are not as important to investing as they would like investors to believe,” said Richard Bernstein, chief executive and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors, an investment advisory firm. “That’s always been our working model.”Mr. Bernstein said corporate fundamentals remained strong. “Corporate profits remain healthy, liquidity remains abundant, and investors generally remain scared of stocks,” he said.If presidential tweeting has not been driving the stock market, what should individual investors look for in equities? Analysts said investors should start by separating the political noise from the signals companies were sending out.For one, any corporate tax cut is not necessarily a short-term gain for the stock market. Edward J. Perkin, chief equity investment officer with Eaton Vance, said a tax cut could actually result in a short-term drop in stock prices. And the companies that have been driving the stock market’s growth, like health care and technology firms, will not benefit as much from a tax cut as smaller domestic companies that had not been able to take advantage of the loopholes and deductions under the current tax system.Other analysts argue that the prospect of tax cuts ceased being a factor in this rally a few months into Mr. Trump’s presidency, when he and the Republican Congress failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act.“Corporate tax cuts are not priced into the market, because there is still skepticism toward the legislative process,” said John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Financial.For 2018, analysts are predicting that the stock market will continue to do well but with greater swings.“I always love corporate profits,” Mr. Lynch said. “We can all get really geeky with these valuation measurements, but if you think about it, we have record profits growing slightly above historical rates. The Fed is tightening policy, and we’re still growing. That’s a pretty good recipe for equity investors.”Anthony Roth, chief investment officer of Wilmington Trust, said one difference in his strategy was a plan to use more active managers who pick stocks and to cut passively managed index funds. He said Wilmington Trust’s research showed that active managers were outperforming the market as a whole.Or put another way: The skill that an active manager has is valuable in an environment when tweets about politics and people rattle less sophisticated investors.Today, Mr. Sonnenfeldt said, he and the 580 members of Tiger 21, who have an average net worth of about $100 million, have nearly three-quarters of their money in private equity, real estate and publicly traded stocks.Over the last year, he said, the group’s concern has not been with the political environment but with interest rates and wondering how long they will stay as low at they are. The group remains bullish on the advantages that American businesses have, like lower energy and transportation costs, over competitors in other countries.So what could end the stock market’s run?CTBC Bank USA put that question to affluent investors in California, New Jersey and New York, all blue states that would be affected by a loss of deductions for state and property taxes. The poll found that they remained confident about the economic and investment landscape, but that they feared a political threat like a conflict with North Korea or a large terrorist attack in the United States.“The only thing we worry about is this geopolitical risk,” said Noor Menai, president and chief executive of CTBC Bank USA. “Nothing gets amplified. Markets take it in stride.”Yet Mr. Menai said seasoned financial services professionals and institutional investors had a distinct advantage over individual investors.“We’ve been through three crises over the past 25 years, and each time the market has reconstructed itself,” he said. “Over time, the insiders such as me have come to understand what the hype is versus what can happen.”But individual investors do not have that knowledge. They still get scared about investing in a rising stock market because they fear it’s going to collapse. When that happens, said Judith Ward, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price, she asks clients to focus on what they can control.For example, if they are near retirement and cannot weather a 20 or 30 percent drop in their assets, she said, they should invest more conservatively.“There is anxiety and uncertainty about the political climate, but my sense is people are looking at their personal situation and asking how is all of this going to impact them,” she said. And that, she said, can be summed up in one question: “How long can this bull market last?”I’ll bet you won’t find that answer in a tweet.', "TOKYO – Shigeo Iizuka, whose sister was abducted by North Korea and brought to that country 39 years ago, has thanked President Donald Trump for listening to him and other relatives of abductees, and expressed hope that the meeting would lead to a breakthrough on the issue.Iizuka, who is 79, and relatives of seven other abductees met Monday with Trump and sought his help in bringing their loved ones home.Iizuka's sister, Yaeko Taguchi, disappeared in 1978 at the age of 22, leaving behind two small children.North Korea in 2002 acknowledged for the first time abducting 13 Japanese citizens, saying eight of them had died, without providing proof.

Doesn’t Crack Down on Anthem Protests - The New York TimesSOMERSET, N.J. — President Trump on Sunday called for football fans to boycott N.F.L. games unless the league fires or suspends players who refuse to stand for the national anthem, saying that players must “stop disrespecting our flag and country.”“If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our country, you will see change take place fast,” Mr. Trump wrote, on the second weekend morning in a row in which he vented over the issue on social media. “Fire or suspend!”The tweet suggested that the president, who used an expletive on Friday night to refer to players who kneel or sit in protest during the anthem — a practice that took hold last season among some African-American players after Colin Kaepernick, the now-former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, did so to protest racial and social injustice — is bent on deepening a bitter culture-war fight with the N.F.L.Follow our live coverage of N.F.L. protests and reactions here.It is a highly charged debate, with unmistakable racial undertones, pitting advocates of free speech who argue that professional athletes should have a right to use their positions to call attention to social issues against those who contend that refusing to honor the anthem disrespects the military and the nation, and that sports is no place for such displays.In a second posting on Sunday morning, the president suggested that fans were already punishing the N.F.L. to protest players’ behavior, arguing that they were eschewing not only the “boring games,” but also athletes who fall to one knee during the anthem.In fact, the decline in attendance predates the anthem protests, and while N.F.L. television ratings did dip last season, it is unclear whether the protests or other factors, like the presidential election and cord-cutting, caused the drop. Black social media users have also called for an N.F.L. boycott.At a rally on Friday in Huntsville, Ala., the president alluded to some of those factors, saying that the “No. 1 reason” ratings were down “massively” was that “they like watching what’s happening with yours truly.”Mr. Trump first raised the protest issue at the Huntsville rally, where he also suggested that officials who penalize players for hitting too hard during games were “ruining the game.” On Saturday, in a series of early-morning tweets, the president pressed his N.F.L. criticism and took on top basketball players as well, saying he had disinvited the N.B.A. champion Golden State Warriors from a planned White House visit because of their star player Stephen Curry’s public opposition to him.The fight has struck a chord with many of Mr. Trump’s core supporters, some of whom applauded him on social media for his stance. But it drew harsh denunciations from many prominent African-American players, including LeBron James, and an unusually strong rebuke from Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the N.F.L., whose owners include many donors to, and friends of, the president.Mr. Trump struck back at Mr. Goodell on Saturday evening, nearly 12 hours after he had first raised the topic on Twitter, tweeting that the commissioner’s statement was “trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.”“Tell them to stand!” Mr. Trump added.Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, who is a close friend of Mr. Trump’s and who has spent the night at the White House and ridden with him on Air Force One, issued a pointed statement on Sunday in which he said he was “deeply disappointed with the tone of the comments made by the president” at the rally, and defended players’ right to express themselves.“Our players are intelligent, thoughtful, and care deeply about their community, and I support their right to peacefully effect social change and raise awareness in a manner they feel is most impactful,” Mr. Kraft said.On Sunday, White House officials defended the president’s position, arguing that professional athletes had no business expressing their views on the field.“They have the right to have their First Amendment off the field,” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on ABC’s “This Week.” “This is a job.”Marc Short, the president’s legislative director, said that there was a double standard for players who chose to voice their views on the field, and that the president was speaking for the majority of Americans on what sort of expression was appropriate.“There are high school coaches across America today who are punished for leading their players in prayer, and yet, when an N.F.L. player takes a knee, somehow that player is presumed to be a martyr for a social cause,” Mr. Short said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “The president is standing with the vast majority of Americans who believe that our flag should be respected.”', 'Tillerson’s News Conference Only Highlights Strains With Trump - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — Long-simmering tension within President Trump’s national security team spilled into public view on Wednesday as Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson took the extraordinary step of calling a news conference to affirm his support for Mr. Trump, despite what associates describe as his deep frustration with the president and talk of resignation.Mr. Tillerson praised Mr. Trump but did not deny a report that he once referred to the president as a “moron.” Mr. Trump welcomed Mr. Tillerson’s statement of support and declared “total confidence” in his secretary of state.If Mr. Tillerson had hoped to douse questions about how long he would stay, he instead further fueled a debate about his future. Although he insisted he had never considered resigning, several people close to Mr. Tillerson said he has had to be talked out of drafting a letter of resignation on more than one occasion by his closest allies, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff. And they said he has regularly expressed astonishment at how little Mr. Trump understands the basics of foreign policy.A former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, Mr. Tillerson has never found his place as a subordinate to the hard-charging, unpredictable president. He has bristled at being undercut, as he was over the weekend when Mr. Trump publicly said Mr. Tillerson was “wasting his time” by trying to open talks with North Korea. At the same time, Mr. Tillerson has alienated lawmakers, foreign policy veterans and the news media while demoralizing the State Department, and critics inside and outside the White House consider his troubles self-inflicted.The president initially viewed Mr. Tillerson as a granite-jawed cabinet secretary who fit Mr. Trump’s requirement that top advisers look as if they came out of “central casting,” as he has put it. Mr. Trump regularly boasted about hiring the head of the world’s largest corporation — and in the presence of a profoundly uncomfortable Mr. Tillerson, whom the president for months referred to as “Mr. Exxon.”But the deliberate, slow-talking oil executive has little personal chemistry with the quick-talking, impulsive Mr. Trump. Mr. Tillerson has avoided expressing his pique to the president. But aides and Trump associates who have been in the room with them said Mr. Tillerson’s body language, eye rolling and terse expressions left little doubt that he disapproves of Mr. Trump’s approach.Mr. Trump, they said, has noticed how Mr. Tillerson slouches in his presence, particularly when he disagrees with a decision. When overruled, Mr. Tillerson often says, “It’s your deal,” to the president’s irritation, according to two former administration officials.Mr. Tillerson felt compelled on Wednesday to address the internal schism after NBC News reported that he had been prepared to step down this summer until he was talked out of it and that after a meeting of national security officials at the Pentagon he had derided Mr. Trump as a “moron.” Vice President Mike Pence at one point counseled Mr. Tillerson on how to ease tension with the president, according to the report.“There’s never been a consideration in my mind to leave,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters. “I serve at the appointment of the president, and I am here for as long as the president feels I can be useful to achieving his objectives.”Asked directly if he had called Mr. Trump a “moron,” Mr. Tillerson would not say. “I’m not going to deal with petty stuff like that,” he said.When that left the impression that it was true, a State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, appeared before reporters hours later to deny it on his behalf. “He did not say that,” she said.The spectacle left the State Department paralyzed. In the moments leading up to Mr. Tillerson’s statement, hallways in the department’s cavernous headquarters were nearly deserted as diplomats were glued to televisions wondering whether he would join the parade of top Trump administration officials who have resigned.Indeed, the news conference was the latest rupture in an administration consumed by palace intrigue from the start. Just last week, Tom Price resigned as secretary of health and human services after being publicly scolded by Mr. Trump for using chartered flights. Mr. Trump has lost a chief of staff, a national security adviser, a chief strategist, a press secretary and two communications directors. He has fired the F.B.I. director, belittled his attorney general and publicly assailed the deputy attorney general.That turnover is one reason Mr. Trump has not pushed Mr. Tillerson out, according to advisers. Speaking with reporters in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump dismissed the report that Mr. Tillerson considered resigning. “It was fake news,” he said. “It’s a totally phony story.” Asked about the secretary, Mr. Trump said, “Total confidence in Rex. I have total confidence.”But even as Mr. Tillerson denied a rift with the president on Wednesday, he alluded to significant differences over North Korea and Iran. He stressed a peaceful resolution of the nuclear dispute with North Korea and associated himself with Mr. Mattis, who just a day earlier endorsed retaining the nuclear agreement with Iran that Mr. Trump has threatened to rip up.“President Trump’s ‘America First’ agenda has given voice to millions who felt completely abandoned by the political status quo and who felt their interests came second to those of other countries,” he said. “President Trump’s foreign policy goals break the mold of what people traditionally think is achievable on behalf of our country.”Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, expressed hope that Mr. Tillerson would not leave because he serves as a check on instability. “I think Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Mattis and Chief of Staff Kelly are those people that help separate our country from chaos, and I support them very much,” he said.But others said it was time for him to go. “Rex Tillerson has been dealt a bad hand by the Potus & has played it badly,” Richard N. Haass, a State Department official for Republican presidents and now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote on Twitter, using the initials for president of the United States. “For both reasons he cannot be effective SecState & should resign.”Mr. Tillerson has been frustrated for months, not just by Mr. Trump’s unpredictable policy positions but by his provocative leadership style. He publicly distanced himself when Mr. Trump blamed “both sides” for violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., and bristled when the president gave a political speech to the Boy Scouts of America, an organization Mr. Tillerson once headed. NBC reported that he was so offended by the Boy Scouts speech that he threatened not to return to Washington from a visit to Texas.The episode that Mr. Tillerson called a real breaking point, according to associates, came when he was trying to mediate a dispute between the Persian Gulf state of Qatar and its Arab neighbors. The secretary had long told colleagues that relationships he built over decades in business made him uniquely qualified to broker a deal.But he complained bitterly that he was undermined by Mr. Trump and Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whom he accused of siding with the United Arab Emirates. When Mr. Tillerson publicly called for a “calm and thoughtful dialogue,” the president less than an hour later lashed out at Qatar as a financier of terrorism.Mr. Tillerson was also angry with Stephen K. Bannon, then the president’s chief strategist, whom he accused of planting negative news stories, including a report that the secretary had dressed down a White House official, Johnny DeStefano, in the West Wing. During that same meeting, Mr. Tillerson groused to White House officials about Mr. Trump’s tweets, describing them as counterproductive to his efforts at diplomacy, according to a person with direct knowledge.His aides also have been looking over their shoulders at Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations, who is seen as a probable replacement if Mr. Tillerson leaves. R. C. Hammond, Mr. Tillerson’s spokesman, told NBC that Mr. Pence had asked Mr. Tillerson if Ms. Haley was helpful to the administration.Mr. Hammond on Wednesday said he “spoke out of line about conversations I wasn’t privy to,” and a spokesman for Mr. Pence said any suggestion that the vice president questioned Ms. Haley’s value was “categorically false.”', 'Steven Mulroy on the Russia contacts, legit or not?President Donald Trump again took up the cause of former national security adviser Mike Flynn Saturday night, complaining that Flynn\'s "life is destroyed" while Hillary Clinton escaped legal reckoning.Trump tweeted: "So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday "interrogation" with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard?"So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard?Many people in our Country are asking what the “Justice” Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and “acid washed” 33,000 Emails? No justice!He then added: "Many people in our Country are asking what the "Justice" Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and "acid washed" 33,000 Emails? No justice!"Clinton was interviewed for more than three hours at FBI headquarters over the July 4 weekend in 2016. Because she was not in custody, her interview was not recorded. Former FBI Director James Comey has said that Clintondid not lie to the FBI during her interview.Earlier Saturday, Trump argued that there was nothing improper in Flynn\'s conversations with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak in December 2016. Flynn pleaded guilty Friday to lying to the FBI about those conversations.The president tweeted that he fired Flynn because the retired Army lieutenant general lied about those conversations to Vice President Mike Pence as well as the FBI. That suggested that Trump may have known Flynn lied to the FBI when he fired him.Trump associates tried to put distance Saturday evening between the president himself and the tweet. One person familiar with the situation said the morning tweet was actually crafted by John Dowd, one of the president\'s personal attorneys. Dowd declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press on Saturday night.It\'s unclear why Trump would cite lying to the FBI as a reason for firing Flynn. Doing so suggests the president knew at the time that Flynn had done something that is against the law, and therefore the investigation could not be as frivolous as he\'s been portraying.It\'s also unclear how he would know that, if information about Russian contacts had not reached him, as he has been implying in his own defense.Flynn left the White House in February, only acknowledging that he had given an incomplete account to Pence of his conversations with Kislyak. After Trump forced Flynn out, he asked FBI Director James Comey to end the bureau\'s probe in the matter, according to Comey\'s account. Comey refused, and Trump fired him, too.Then-White House spokesman Sean Spicer said after Flynn\'s firing that it was the result of a "trust issue" and the White House counsel\'s office had determined there was not a legal issue."Whether or not he actually misled the vice president was the issue, and that was ultimately what led to the president asking for and accepting the resignation of Gen. Flynn," Spicer told reporters on Feb. 14. "That\'s it, pure and simple. It was a matter of trust."Trump has been publicly dismissive of Comey and of special counsel Robert Mueller\'s continuing investigation, and was often generous in his appraisal of Flynn, except to say his adviser could not stay on the job after misleading his vice president.At the time, Pence said Trump was justified in firing Flynn because Flynn had lied to him. Neither Trump nor Pence indicated concern then that the FBI had not been told the true story.Pence, who served as head of Trump\'s transition, has not publicly commented on Flynn\'s plea.The Associated Press contributed to this report.', "Conor Powell reports on the high-stakes decision being debated in the White House.U.S. Marine Corps Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams (FAST) have bolstered security across “several” U.S. embassies in the Middle East ahead of the expected announcement Wednesday by President Donald Trump about moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem — as well as mulling whether to recognize Jerusalem officially as the Israeli capital.Israeli security officials say they're also preparing for a potential outbreak of violence. “We understand that in any moment the order that we have achieved could change,” said Jerusalem District Police CommanderMajor Gen. Yoram Halvy about the potential outbreak of violence with moving the U.S. Embassy to the holy city. “Any second this place could be set on fire.”Jerusalem’s status long has been a flash point in the Arab-Israeli conflict, with both Palestinians and Israelis claiming the city as their capital. In 1995, Congress passed a law recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, but allowed U.S. presidents to sign a six-month waiver postponing the move to entice both Israeli and Palestinians to the negotiating table.WHY TRUMP’S PROMISE TO MOVE US EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM IS SO CONTROVERSIALOn Tuesday, Palestinian leaders said that if Trump recognized Jerusalem, as he has promised to do, the move would end U.S.-led peace efforts.“If Mr. Trump recognizes Jerusalem, he will destroy any chance of the deal of the century,” Dr. Nabil Shaath, an adviser to Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas, said referring to Trump’s vow to reach a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians.Shaath said Palestinians would continue to work with other countries toward a two-state solution.ERDOGAN: RECOGNIZING JERUSALEM AS ISRAEL’S CAPITAL IS ‘RED LINE’ FOR MUSLIMSArab and European leaders also have pushed the Trump administration to resume peace negotiations. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah political party has called for daily protests marches this week.With the threat of a violent Palestinian reaction, Israel’s police and military commanders have been meeting to evaluate the potential for escalation.Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.Conor Powell joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in 2009 and serves as a Jerusalem-based foreign correspondent.", "Columnist Mark Steyn sounds off on the latest attack from Rep. Al Green.Texas Democrat Al Green said Wednesday he’s giving his colleagues in the House a Christmas deadline to vote on impeaching President Trump.“I now announce that before Christmas, there will be a vote on the chief inciter of racism, bigotry, hatred, xenophobia, sexism and ethnocentrism,” he said on the House floor, adding that he prayed the United States will “continue to reject what the inciter in chief, Donald J. Trump has been causing this country to have to endure.”This is hardly the first time Green has called for impeaching the president, though he hasn't put a timeframe on it until now.Last month, Green unveiled formal articles of impeachment, though it never made it to the House floor for a vote. At the time, Green said he wanted to give lawmakers extra time to read through the proposal.Green’s resolution covered four articles of impeachment.One accused the president of “inciting white supremacy, sexism, bigotry, hatred, xenophobia, race-baiting, and racism by demeaning, defaming, disrespecting and disparaging women and certain minorities.” Another alleged Trump brought “shame and dishonor to the office of the presidency by associating the majesty and dignity of the presidency with causes rooted in white supremacy, bigotry, racism, anti-Semitism, white nationalism and neo-Nazism.”GREEN INTRODUCES ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST TRUMPWhile acknowledging conservatives aren’t likely to jump on board and kick Trump out of the Oval Office, Green said, “Whatever others will do is their choice. My conscience dictates that I will vote to impeach.”There’s not much enthusiasm among most congressional Democrats to impeach.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly downplayed talk of impeachment and on Sunday told CNN it wasn’t one of her legislative priorities.", 'My Fellow Americans … I’m Thirsty - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — Sometimes, you just get thirsty.Never mind that you’re on national television, having hyped a midafternoon speech. Or that you’re the president of the United States, delivering the remarks from the Diplomatic Room in the White House.And just set aside for a moment your past, snarky criticism of other politicians for sneaking a sip during a speech.Whether any of that went through President Trump’s mind or not during an address to the nation on Wednesday afternoon, he clearly was parched. And so he stopped, after speaking for about 11 minutes, reaching down to his left for the water he expected to be there.He came up dry.“They don’t have water. That’s O.K.,” the president said, taking about a 20-second pause from his remarks extolling his own achievements during his recent visit to Japan. “What? No, it’s O.K.”Flummoxed for a moment, an aide told him to look on the other side, and he finally found his refreshment.The big swig from the iconic, squarish Fiji Water bottle seemed to hit the spot, and Mr. Trump continued delivering his remarks on the success of his “America First” foreign policy. He no doubt hoped that the interruption would not detract from his message.Twitter had other ideas.The medium that Mr. Trump has long embraced was quick to poke fun — and to note the irony. It was not that long ago, after all, that Mr. Trump, then just a real estate tycoon and reality TV star, mocked Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, for a similar television water episode during a State of the Union response in 2013.At the time, Mr. Trump did not give Mr. Rubio any benefit of the doubt.He also frequently raised the issue of Mr. Rubio’s parched-mouth moment when the two of them were running against each other for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.Now, having been likewise afflicted, the president may know what Mr. Rubio felt like at the time.One person who noticed? Mr. Rubio, who took a mild, good-humored shot at his onetime rival.Mr. Trump continued to take a few sips of the water throughout the rest of the speech on Wednesday, though none interrupted his rhythm quite like the initial search for the water bottle.But everything a president does reverberates far and wide, and a made-for-television gaffe like the water episode is no exception. Within seconds, the Wikipedia page for Fiji Water was edited by someone to include the fact that the water is “the official thirst quencher of Donald Trump.”It was removed a few minutes later.', 'Paul Manafort Expects to Be Indicted, Longtime Trump Adviser Says - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — Roger J. Stone Jr., an informal adviser to President Trump, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman is expecting to be indicted by federal prosecutors investigating Russia’s attempts to disrupt last year’s election.Mr. Stone’s remarks about the former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, came after Mr. Stone spent hours behind closed doors with members of the House Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating Russian election interference. Mr. Stone said he had heard about the possible indictment from his lawyers, who had heard it from Mr. Manafort’s lawyers.“I believe his attorneys informed my attorneys of that,” Mr. Stone said Tuesday. “They didn’t seem to know when nor what the charge may be.”The New York Times reported this month that prosecutors working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had told Mr. Manafort they expected to indict him. Mr. Mueller’s team is believed to be investigating Mr. Manafort for possible violations of tax laws, money-laundering prohibitions and requirements to disclose foreign lobbying.Kevin Downing, a lawyer for Mr. Manafort, did not respond to a message seeking comment.In July, federal agents carried out an early-morning raid of Mr. Manafort’s home, taking binders stuffed with documents and copying Mr. Manafort’s computer files, looking for evidence that he set up secret offshore bank accounts.Mr. Stone said on Tuesday that although he was not familiar with the details of Mr. Manafort’s finances, he believed that federal prosecutors were trying to pressure the former campaign chairman into testifying that members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russians to disrupt the election.“I think what’s happening here is that the special counsel will try to manufacture a crime and then say, ‘Look, Manafort, we won’t prosecute you for this if you simply admit you were colluding with the Russians and Donald Trump knew everything,’” Mr. Stone said. “In other words, bear false witness against the president. I’ve known Paul Manafort for over 40 years, and I don’t believe he is going to do that. He is not going to lie, and that would be a lie.”Mr. Stone also said he told the Intelligence Committee that he never worked with Russians to aid Mr. Trump’s campaign, and that he was unaware of any evidence that showed Russian “collusion with any member of the Trump campaign, Trump family, Donald Trump, Trump associates, Trump friends, Trump supporters.”He said he did admit to the committee that he once exchanged messages with someone claiming to be Guccifer 2.0, an online persona that American officials believe was a front in the Russian hacking efforts and responsible for copying thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee.Mr. Stone said he did not know about hacks in advance, and called the exchanges with the suspected hacker “benign and innocuous.” He said that a journalist had connected him with Guccifer 2.0, but he refused to name the journalist because he had spoken to the person “off the record.”“I’m not going to burn somebody who I spoke to off the record,” Mr. Stone said. “If he releases me, if he allows me to release it, I would be happy to give it to the committee. I’m actually going to try to do that.”Mr. Stone’s refusal to name the person who had helped him make contact with Guccifer 2.0 seemed to frustrate Democrats on the committee.“There was one significant area of seminal importance to the committee that Mr. Stone was unwilling to answer our questions,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee. “We hope that he will cooperate in the future. If not, it will be necessary to subpoena him to bring him back to answer those important questions.”Mr. Schiff does not have the power to unilaterally issue a subpoena to Mr. Stone. Committee rules require that any subpoena have the signature of Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who is chairman of the committee.Mr. Stone, a self-proclaimed political “dirty trickster,” said he would be open to returning to the committee “under the right circumstances,” and called Tuesday’s appearance a “very frank exchange.”', 'President Donald Trump visits Asia for a 12-day trip to five nations. The top issue to dominate his agenda: North Korea\'s nuclear program, amid Pyongyang\'s increased missile launches. Here\'s what you need to know about his agenda and what\'s at stake.President Trump embarked on a 13-day trip Friday, with the first stop in Hawaii, ahead of his visit to five major Asian countries in his longest overseas trip to date amid the escalating North Korea threat.The president and first lady departed the White House Friday morning, stopping to chat with reporters on their way to Air Force One.“We are about to begin a long trip,” Trump said, noting that the White House had extended the trip, and added an extra day in the Philippines. “We have a big conference, a second conference. And I think we’re going to have great success.”Trump said that he would be talking about “trade,” and the threat of North Korea.“We’ll be enlisting the help of a lot people and countries and we’ll see what happens,” Trump said. “But I think we’re going to have a very successful trip. There is a lot of good will.”According to administration officials, the president’s trip will be the longest trip to Asia by a president since 1991, when President George H.W. Bush was in office.The president\'s trip comes amid the first charges in special counsel Robert Mueller\'s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.Ahead of the trip, the president said it’s possible he could see Russian President Vladmir Putin while in Asia.“We may have a meeting with Putin,” the president said on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle on Thursday. “And, again – Putin is very important because they can help us with North Korea. They can help us with Syria. We have to talk about Ukraine.”Trump said again Friday before boarding Air Force One that there was "no collusion."Just took off for ceremony @ Pearl Harbor. Will then be heading to Japan, SKorea, China, Vietnam & the Philippines. Will never let you down!Minutes after take-off, the president tweeted details of his trip."Just took off for ceremony @ Pearl Harbor. Will then be heading to Japan, SKorea, China, Vietnam & the Philippines. Will never let you down!" Trump said.The president’s first stop, before heading overseas, is in Hawaii, where he will meet with U.S. Pacific Command, and visit Pearl Harbor and the Pearl Harbor memorial.By Sunday, the president will be in Japan, where he is slated to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for meetings. As they did at Mar-A-Lago, Trump and Abe will play a round of golf at a country club in Japan—this time, joined by the world’s No. 4 golfer, Hideki Matsuyama.Trump’s visit in Japan, according to the White House, will include meetings with service members and bilateral meetings.The president is also expected to meet with families of Japanese citizens abducted by Kim Jong Un’s rogue regime.Trump and Abe spoke earlier this week, and “affirmed the important of promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” and “maintaining close coordination” between the United States and Japan, and with the international community “to maximize pressure on North Korea.”The president’s next stop will be South Korea, where he will have a bilateral meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Trump will meet with service members, and also is slated for a speech at the National Assembly in Seoul.A senior administration official told reporters during a White House background briefing this week that there was not enough time in the president’s schedule to accommodate a trip to the Demilitarized Zone, which has separated North Korea and South Korea for 64 years.Instead of the DMZ, Trump will visit military base Camp Humphreys, which is set 40 miles south of Seoul, to highlight the U.S.-South Korean partnership.The president’s trip to South Korea comes amid escalating tensions and rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea.Trump said in his United Nations speech in September that he would “totally destroy” the rogue nation, if necessary. He also has continually dubbed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “little Rocket Man.”Trump’s next stop is China, an important visit that will draw much attention amid the president’s expected requests for Chinese President Xi Jinping.Trump is expected to ask Xi, whom he hosted at Mar-A-Lago earlier this year, to impose limits on oil exports and coal imports with North Korea, as well as broader limits on financial transactions with the regime, Reuters reported. China is responsible for more than 90 percent of all trade with North Korea.“Melania and I look forward to being with President Xi & Madame Peng Liyuan in China in two weeks for what will hopefully be a historic trip!” Trump tweeted last month.Trump’s next stop is Vietnam, where he will take part in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) events, according to the White House.Trump will go to the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi for an official visit and bilateral engagements with President Tran Dai Quang and other senior Vietnamese leaders.The final stop for Trump is the Philippines. The president was only slated to be in the Philippines for one day, but on Friday announced an additional day.Trump is set for a bilateral meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been accused of human rights abuses, including killing suspected drug dealers. The White House has said that Trump could raise concerns with the program, though Duterte and Trump shared a “warm rapport” during a phone conversation.While in the Philippines, the president will also attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 50thanniversary dinner. ASEAN consists of ten members: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.Trump will celebrate the 40th anniversary of U.S.-ASEAN relations at the U.S.-ASEAN Summit and participate in bilateral meetings with Duterte and other leaders.“The president’s trip will focus on three goals,” National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters at the White House press briefing Thursday. “First, strengthening international resolve to denuclearize North Korea. Second, promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region. Third, advance American prosperity through fair and reciprocal trade and economic practices.”McMaster added that the president would “reiterate the plain fact” that North Korea is a “threat to the entire world,” also promising that Trump would continue to call on “all responsible nations” to isolate the North Korean regime “economically and politically.”Fox News\' Serafin Gomez and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

(REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi)                                                                    NEW YORK – The Trump SoHo hotel is dropping the name it shares with the U.S. president. The Trump Organization said Wednesday that it is ending its licensing deal with the New York hotel amid reports that the property has struggled to attract business. The company owned by President Donald Trump said that it has signed a deal with the owners of the hotel and residential tower to end management of the property and the use of the Trump name. The announcement comes as the company's other hotels and resorts around the world are showing mixed results.The tower in the hip, touristy Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo has been the source of controversy and trouble for years. One of its original backers turned out to be a businessman convicted in a Mafia-linked stock fraud scheme. Later, Trump's three oldest children were alleged to have defrauded buyers of condominiums in the building in a case that was settled in 2011. Last month, a New York City prosecutor who had dropped a probe sparked by the fraud suit returned a $32,000 campaign contribution from a lawyer who represented the Trump Organization in the investigation. The prosecutor said the contribution had no impact on his decision to drop the probe. There have also been signs of business trouble recently at the Trump SoHo. Its sushi restaurant closed earlier this year, and The New York Times has reported a drop in room rates at the hotel and slow sales of condos in the residential part of the building. The president's company said it would have no comment beyond its news release announcing the move. As is the case with many Trump-branded properties, the Trump Organization doesn't own the Trump SoHo. Other hotels and resorts bearing the Trump name appear to be struggling, while some are booming. Last month, the British government published financial statements showing losses more than doubled at his two golf clubs in Scotland last year. Business at his golf courses in Los Angeles and New York City are also down, according to reports based on government records. His opulent Washington, D.C., hotel is doing fine, though, attracting lobbyists and foreign diplomats with business in the capital. The Trump Organization described its agreement with CIM Group and other owners of the Trump SoHo as a buyout deal that will allow it to end its management and licensing agreement by the end of the year.", 'How World Leaders Reacted to Trump at the U.N. - The New York TimesHe was called a “giant gold Goliath” and a “rogue newcomer.” But in a few corners the remarks made by President Trump at the United Nations were described as “courageous” and “gratifying.”Throughout the week, Mr. Trump’s first address to the General Assembly drew many direct and indirect swipes, from allies and rivals alike, and sparse support.While the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, attacked Mr. Trump from afar — calling him a “dotard” in a statement on North Korean national television — others used their platforms at the United Nations to respond.Some leaders were more subtle than others.Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe’s 93-year-old president, took aim at Mr. Trump during his own speech on Thursday. Mr. Mugabe mocked Mr. Trump as a “giant gold Goliath” and said other nations were “embarrassed if not frightened” by his statements about North Korea.“Are we having a return of Goliath to our midst, who threatens the extinction of other countries?” Mr. Mugabe asked. Some responded with applause to his reference to the biblical character who threatened the Israelites before being slain by the young shepherd David, who would become king.Mr. Mugabe then went on to address Mr. Trump directly, telling him to “blow your trumpet in a musical way towards the values of unity, peace, cooperation, togetherness and dialogue which we have always stood for.”During his speech, Mr. Trump notably omitted any talk of climate change, seen as one of the most pressing issues for many world leaders.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada received the longest applause during his General Assembly speech on Thursday after an implicit dig at Mr. Trump.“There is no country on the planet that can walk away from the challenge and reality of climate change,” Mr. Trudeau said, referring to Mr. Trump’s plans to pull out of the Paris climate accord.Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, was quick to embrace Mr. Trump’s paean to sovereignty.“It is gratifying to note, as the U.S. President Donald Trump unequivocally stated from this podium last Tuesday, that it is important to comply with the principles of sovereignty in international affairs,” Mr. Lavrov said during his General Assembly speech on Thursday.“I believe that anyone can sign on to these words,” he added.But Mr. Lavrov was also critical of Mr. Trump’s policies on Iran, saying the “world is watching with alarm as the U.S. imposes yet a new set of restrictions against Iran.”Sigmar Gabriel, the German foreign minister, delivered one of the toughest rebukes from a longtime American ally. Taking aim at Mr. Trump’s focus on sovereignty, he denounced the “national egoism” of his speech.“The motto ‘Our Country First’ not only leads to more national confrontations and less prosperity, in the end, there will only be losers,” Mr. Gabriel said Thursday.“This worldview describes the world as an arena, a kind of battleground, in which everyone is fighting against everyone else and in which everyone has to assert their own interests, either alone or in alliances of convenience,” Mr. Gabriel said. “In this worldview, the law of the strongest prevails, not the strength of the law.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel praised Mr. Trump’s speech in a series of Twitter messages sent shortly after the address.“President Trump spoke the truth about the great dangers facing our world and issued a powerful call to confront them in order to ensure the future of humanity,” Mr. Netanyahu wrote Tuesday.He also applauded Mr. Trump’s criticism of the Iran nuclear deal, an agreement that Israel has opposed from the beginning.Later in the day, Mr. Netanyahu echoed the sentiments in his own speech to the assembly.“I’ve listened to countless speeches in this hall, but I can say this: None were bolder, none more courageous and forthright than the one delivered by President Trump today,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “President Trump rightly called the nuclear deal with Iran, he called it an embarrassment.”President Hassan Rouhani of Iran did not hold back when it was his turn on the podium. While Mr. Rouhani did not mentioned the American president by name, he took clear aim at Mr. Trump on Wednesday.“It will be a great pity if this agreement were to be destroyed by rogue newcomers to the world of politics,” Mr. Rouhani said, referring to the nuclear accord between his country and six world powers. Mr. Trump had assailed the deal as “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.”Mr. Rouhani praised the agreement as a “model” and pledged that Iran would not be the first to violate it.About an hour later, he held an hourlong news conference, in which he demanded an apology from Mr. Trump for what he called “completely baseless allegations” about Iran.', "                                    James Jackson was charged in federal court Tuesday after repeatedly calling the Secret Service field office in Chicago, Illinois, threatening President Trump's life.

I’m going to blow Trump’s brains out.”A woman who Jackson frequently called in an unrelated incident told investigators that after she met a man named “Jamie” online, he threatened to “cut off her head and parade it in front of the White House for Trump.”Jackson, who was arraigned in Spokane, Wash., and remains in custody, denied the allegations against him through his federal defender.", 'Trump’s ‘Pocahontas’ Taunt - The New York TimesTo the Editor:Re “At Event for Code Talkers, Trump Again Derides Warren as ‘Pocahontas’ ” (news article, Nov. 28):Once again, Donald Trump has only made a fool of himself and shown the world that he is still a juvenile in so many ways by calling Senator Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas” in front of Navajo veterans of World War II.How much more will it take for all of the Trump apologists to realize that President Trump is historically ignorant, socially oblivious and downright insulting to the people he tried to honor?He is an embarrassment to the office of the presidency and to the country as a whole. Every day brings a new disturbing action by this man we call president. What a shame for our country!MICHAEL HADJIARGYROUCENTERPORT, N.Y.', 'WASHINGTON – When President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that Iran had "just test-fired" a missile, he seemed to know something the rest of the government did not. Turns out, he did not.There was no Iranian ballistic missile launch, three U.S. officials said Tuesday.Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard had used a military parade on Friday to display its Khoramshahr medium-range ballistic missile, which is capable of reaching Israel and much of the Middle East. That same day, video of the test firing of a Khoramshahr aired on Iranian state TV. The time or location of the test was not mentioned in the report, and it appears that the video footage was from a failed Iranian missile test earlier this year.It\'s unclear where Trump got his information, but it apparently did not come from U.S. intelligence agencies, which keep a continuous lookout for missile launches around the globe. As president, Trump could easily have checked with the CIA or other intelligence agencies to verify whether Iran had actually test-fired a missile.In his tweet he renewed his criticism of the nuclear agreement reached with Iran during the Obama administration."Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel," he wrote. "They are also working with North Korea. Not much of an agreement we have!"The nuclear agreement is designed to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb but does not prohibit it from developing missiles.Among the three officials who said there was no Iranian missile launch last week, one said officials who work on Iran issues were caught off guard by Trump\'s tweet. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an intelligence issue.Trump has suggested he might seek to renegotiate the nuclear deal or abandon it. He told the U.N. General Assembly last week that the accord was "nothing short of an embarrassment" and the "worst one-sided deal perhaps in American history."Officials have said Trump might use the Oct. 15 deadline for certifying to Congress whether Iran is in compliance with the nuclear deal to either declare Iran in violation or determine that the agreement is no longer in the national security interest of the U.S.Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday that Iran is adhering to its obligations under the nuclear agreement, known officially as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. He stressed that his concern is about Iran\'s behavior in other areas, such as its development of ballistic missiles and its support for extremist groups.Dunford declined to say publicly what advice he has given Trump on whether to recertify Iran\'s compliance with the nuclear deal.', '                                    A police officer involved in an accident lies on the ground as President Trump\'s motorcade travels past him in Indianapolis, Sept. 27, 2017.

A photographer captured the officer on the ground with his uniform ripped.Police released a cellphone video of Turner in the hospital taking the call from the president. He was wearing a neck brace, but laughed and appeared to be in good spirits.The White House initially said Trump called during the flight back to Washington to check on the officer\'s condition and thank him for his service.Trump was in the city to push his so-called “middle class miracle,” and sell his plan to overhaul the nation’s tax code and revive his legislative agenda."This is a revolutionary change and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up at levels that you haven\'t seen in many years," Trump told supporters at the Indiana State Fairgrounds.Edmund DeMarche is a news editor for FoxNews.com. Follow him on Twitter @EDeMarche.', 'WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump pledged to spare no effort to help Puerto Ricans recover from Maria\'s ruinous aftermath Friday even as San Juan\'s mayor, her voice breaking with rage, accused his administration of "killing us with the inefficiency."Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz implored Trump from afar to "make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives," while the president asserted that U.S. officials and emergency personnel are working all-out against daunting odds, with "incredible" results.Trump\'s acting homeland security secretary, Elaine Duke, visited the island Friday, surveying the ravaged landscape by helicopter in an hourlong tour, driving past still-flooded streets, twisted billboards and roofs with gaping holes, and offering encouragement to some of the 10,000 emergency personnel she says the U.S. government has on the ground.Duke tried, too, to move on from the remarks she made a day earlier in which she called the federal relief effort a "good-news story." But on that front, she ran into winds as fierce as Maria."We are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency," Cruz said in a news conference. "I am begging, begging anyone that can hear us, to save us from dying."Thousands more Puerto Ricans got water and rationed food Friday as an aid bottleneck began to ease. By now, telecommunications are back for about 30 percent of the island, nearly half of the supermarkets have reopened at least for reduced hours and about 60 percent of the gas stations are pumping. But many remain desperate for necessities, most urgently water, long after the Sept. 20 hurricane.Trump said Puerto Rico is "totally unable" to handle the catastrophe on its own. "They are working so hard, but there\'s nothing left," he said. "It\'s been wiped out." He said the government is "fully engaged in the disaster and the response and recovery effort."Trump said he was not aware of Duke\'s "good-news" remark."I haven\'t heard what she said," he told reporters. "I can tell you this: We have done an incredible job considering there\'s absolutely nothing to work with."Yet even in voicing solidarity and sympathy with Puerto Rico, he drew attention again to the island\'s pre-hurricane debt burden and infrastructure woes, leaving doubt how far Washington will go to make the U.S. territory whole."Ultimately the government of Puerto Rico will have to work with us to determine how this massive rebuilding effort — it will end up being one of the biggest ever — will be funded and organized, and what we will do with the tremendous amount of existing debt already on the island," he said. "We will not rest, however, until the people of Puerto Rico are safe."Earlier he tweeted: "The fact is that Puerto Rico has been destroyed by two hurricanes. Big decisions will have to be made as to the cost of its rebuilding!"Speaking to the press, and taking no questions, Duke said neither she nor Trump will rest until displaced Puerto Ricans are back home, schools, hospitals and clean water are back and the island\'s economy is moving again. Duke said she is aware people are suffering and "clearly the situation in Puerto Rico after the devastating hurricane is not satisfactory."Trump weighed in on his way to New Jersey for the weekend.He praised his emergency management director, Brock Long, for doing a "fantastic job," pointed out that Duke is serving in an acting capacity and said "she\'s working very hard."During this season\'s trio of monster hurricanes — Harvey, Irma, Maria — Trump and his administration have drifted into the perilous territory of premature self-congratulation in the face of unfolding catastrophe, seemingly unmindful of the "Brownie moment" that scarred George W. Bush\'s presidency.Bush famously told his emergency management director, Michael Brown, "Brownie, you\'re doing a heck of a job" during what proved to be a tragically inept federal response to deadly Hurricane Katrina in 2005.Trump has repeatedly boasted about the positive reviews he said his administration is getting from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for its relief effort, even as people in remote towns struggle to find food, water and other basics. Then Duke said before leaving Washington that the federal relief effort was a "good-news story" because of "our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths.""Let me clarify," she said Friday upon her arrival in San Juan. She said she meant "it was good news that people of Puerto Rico and many public servants of the United States are working together."Cruz responded, "This is a people-are-dying story."Trump is expected to survey the damage Tuesday.___Lugo reported from San Juan.', 'Trump Administration to Lift Ban on ‘Trophy’ Elephant Imports - The New York TimesThe Trump administration will begin allowing hunters to bring into the United States “trophy” elephants killed in Zimbabwe, reversing a 2014 ban on a practice that has received intense scrutiny in recent years.Though African elephants are protected under the Endangered Species Act, the law allows the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to authorize imports of trophies if the agency finds that the hunts in which the animals were killed contribute to the survival of the species.The United States banned such imports from Zimbabwe in 2014 because of a lack of data on conservation efforts there. Now the United States agency says it is satisfied with Zimbabwe’s actions and believes such hunts can be beneficial for the species by bringing money to local communities and providing incentives to conserve elephants.“Since our 2014 and 2015 findings, there are strong indications that the efforts of private landowners and consortiums to manage elephants within their areas of control have received greater support,” the federal agency said in a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Friday.The Zimbabwean government, it added, was contributing to efforts to combat poaching and working with partners to improve elephant management.The reversal of the ban comes less than two weeks after the agency moved to allow imports from Zambia. Both decisions generally apply to elephants hunted in either country between 2016 and 2018. Hunters are allowed two imports per year.Hunting trophies can include any number of body parts, including tusks. In 2016, the federal government, under President Barack Obama, imposed a near-total ban on the commercial trade of African elephant ivory, though trophies were exempted from that ban.The African elephant population has drastically declined in the past decade, shrinking by about 30 percent between 2007 and 2014, according to the Great Elephant Census, an effort financed by the philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.That project found that Zambia and Zimbabwe have had mixed success in maintaining or growing their elephant populations. Parks near countries with poor elephant preservation efforts were not doing well, for example. But elephant populations elsewhere were stable or increasing.Trophy tourism in Africa has come under high-profile scrutiny in recent years.In 2015, an American dentist sparked international outrage after killing Cecil, a lion beloved by visitors to a national park in Zimbabwe. During the recent presidential campaign, photos recirculated on social media showing two of Donald Trump’s sons on safari in Zimbabwe posing with several dead animals. One photo showed Donald Trump Jr. holding a knife in one hand and a severed elephant tail in the other.And, in a report published last year, the Democratic staff of the House Natural Resources Committee challenged the claim that hunting can help to pay for conservation, arguing that more oversight is needed.News of the federal government’s decision was reported in a Tuesday blog post by Safari Club International, a hunters group, which said that officials had announced the decision at a conference in Africa.The group had joined the National Rifle Association in suing the federal government over the 2014 ban and said that it would continue to challenge that decision so hunters can retrieve trophies from hunts that are still excluded.Wayne Pacelle, the president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States, criticized the decision in a blog post, describing the practice of trophy hunting as a “new form of colonialism.”“What kind of message does it send to say to the world that poor Africans who are struggling to survive cannot kill elephants in order to use or sell their parts to make a living, but that it’s just fine for rich Americans to slay the beasts for their tusks to keep as trophies?” he wrote.Mr. Pacelle also called into question Zimbabwe’s ability to manage its elephant population, noting that the government is itself in crisis. Just this week, its longtime autocratic ruler, Robert Mugabe, was placed under house arrest by the military.', 'Senator Bob Corker Takes On Trump - The New York TimesTo the Editor:“G.O.P. Senator Rebukes Trump Over ‘Reality Show’ Behavior” (front page, Oct. 9):Senate Republicans, where is your moral courage? Where is your commitment to your constituents to keep us safe from harm — this time inflicted by an erratic, lying, threatening, incompetent Donald Trump? When will your voices be heard?Senator Bob Corker, under attack from the president and fellow Republicans because he dared to voice his alarm at Mr. Trump’s childish, petulant, destructive instincts and behavior, stated that the vast majority of Senate Republicans understand the dangerous situation triggered by Mr. Trump’s volatility. The Senate Republicans know full well the daily efforts made inside the Trump White House to “contain him,” Mr. Corker claimed.What is needed for a Senate Republican to speak courageously: lame-duck status like Mr. Corker, grave illness like Senator John McCain, womanhood like Senator Susan Collins? Have you acquiesced and accepted the status of a puppet like Vice President Mike Pence, who, on the boss’s orders, exited a football game on Sunday? Are there no “Profiles in Courage” among you?MARY ELLEN BYRNE, PHILADELPHIATo the Editor:It’s long past time that Republicans in Congress wake up, develop some courage and take action. Senator Bob Corker, a respected Republican and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has now plainly stated what many have known but refused to acknowledge — that Donald Trump continues to lie, and is temperamentally unfit and unqualified to be president. Mr. Corker doesn’t mince words: He makes clear that Mr. Trump is unstable and is on a path to bring about World War III.Trump supporters surely understand that Mr. Corker is not “Crooked Hillary” or a member of the opposition. My question for Republican leaders is: How long are you going to wait to prevent a real catastrophe? Is your concern about being challenged in a primary or not being re-elected more important than averting a nuclear war, the erosion of our system of government and loss of American credibility abroad?RICHARD CHERWITZ, AUSTIN, TEX.To the Editor:Re “Bitter Feud Threatens Slim Edge in Senate” (news article, Oct. 10): Kellyanne Conway calls Bob Corker’s tweets “irresponsible”? And she argues that a year later he still can’t accept the results of last year’s election? Is she confusing Mr. Corker with President Trump?THOMAS E. MANNS, ST. LOUIS', '‘Very Frustrated’ Trump Becomes Top Critic of Law Enforcement - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — One of President Trump’s biggest disappointments in office, by his own account, was discovering that he is not supposed to personally direct law enforcement decisions by the Justice Department and the F.B.I. So, instead, he has made himself into perhaps the most vocal critic of America’s system of justice ever to occupy the Oval Office.Just this week, he denounced the criminal justice system as “a joke” and “a laughingstock.” He demanded that the suspect in the New York terrorist attack be executed. He spent Friday berating the Justice Department and F.B.I. for not investigating his political opponents. He then turned to the military justice system and called a court-martial decision “a complete and total disgrace.”The repeated assaults on law enforcement cross lines that presidents have largely observed since the Watergate era, raising questions about the separation of politics and the law. But as extraordinary as Mr. Trump’s broadsides are, perhaps more striking is that investigators and prosecutors are so far ignoring the head of the executive branch in which they serve while military judges and juries are for the most part disregarding the opinions of their commander in chief.“You know, the saddest thing is that because I’m the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department,” Mr. Trump said in a radio interview on Thursday on the “Larry O’Connor Show.” “I am not supposed to be involved with the F.B.I. I’m not supposed to be doing the kind of things that I would love to be doing. And I’m very frustrated by it.”That frustration has been fueled particularly by Mr. Trump’s inability to control the special counsel investigation into whether his campaign coordinated with Russia during last year’s election, an investigation that unveiled its first criminal charges this week against Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman and two other advisers.Mr. Trump has made clear that he sees the attorney general and the F.B.I. director as his personal agents rather than independent figures, lashing out at both for not protecting him from the Russia investigation.In May, he fired the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who later testified that he had refused Mr. Trump’s demands that he pledge loyalty and publicly declare that the president was not personally under investigation. In July, Mr. Trump told The New York Times that he would never have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions had he known that Mr. Sessions would recuse himself from overseeing the investigation.While his lawyers have for now persuaded Mr. Trump not to publicly attack Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, the president has not ruled out firing him, a scenario that other presidents facing special prosecutors considered virtually unthinkable. Asked on Friday whether he might fire Mr. Sessions if the attorney general does not investigate Democrats, Mr. Trump left open the prospect: “I don’t know,” he said.The president’s Twitter posts and comments drew rebukes from Democrats and some Republicans. Former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who served for six years under President Barack Obama, said Mr. Trump’s comments make the job of law enforcement officials more difficult.“Combined with his improper attempts to influence Department of Justice actions, this demonstrates that he is a president who is willing to flout those norms that protect the rule of law,” Mr. Holder said in an interview.Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican who has broken with Mr. Trump, said the Justice Department should be free of political interference.“President Trump’s pressuring of the Justice Department and F.B.I. to pursue cases against his adversaries and calling for punishment before trials take place are totally inappropriate and not only undermine our justice system but erode the American people’s confidence in our institutions,” he said.Some conservatives defended Mr. Trump’s right to exercise oversight of the country’s law enforcement agencies, saying that it would be dangerous to have an attorney general and an F.B.I. director who were not answerable to elected leaders.“The notion that law enforcement, in particular, is somehow to be insulated from political influences and therefore inevitably insulated from political accountability is a horribly dangerous idea from the standpoint of civil liberty,” said David B. Rivkin Jr., a White House and Justice Department lawyer under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.However, Mr. Rivkin added, “That doesn’t mean you exercise your authority to direct those things in a crude and obscene fashion. You have to exercise some politesse about it.”Other presidents have been criticized for political intervention when they spoke out about continuing criminal cases. Peter J. Wallison, who was the White House counsel under Reagan, said his president at times spoke out on cases of interest, including the investigation of Reagan’s onetime adviser Michael K. Deaver.“I would try to discourage him, for all the good reasons people in the White House are probably trying to discourage Trump, but it was to no avail,” Mr. Wallison said. “Trump is doing the same, except to a greater extent.”Mr. Wallison noted that Mr.  Obama at times commented on investigations, recalling statements denying wrongdoing by the Internal Revenue Service when conservative groups found their tax exemptions targeted for scrutiny. “Presidents say these things because they are human beings and have emotions,” he said. “Nevertheless, there is little evidence that public statements have any effect on outcomes.”Before Watergate, presidents were less reluctant to intervene in law enforcement. The administrations of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson had the F.B.I. wiretap the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. President Richard M. Nixon had the bureau eavesdrop on the telephone calls of reporters.But in the past four decades, no president has sought to publicly pressure law enforcement as much as Mr. Trump.In a barrage of a dozen tweets on Thursday night and early Friday, Mr. Trump railed at law enforcement agencies for not investigating Democrats. He cited Tony Podesta — the brother of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta — who stepped down from his firm this week amid scrutiny of his lobbying business by Mr. Mueller. And he cited a book excerpt by Donna Brazile, the former interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, who wrote that last year’s primaries were tilted by a fund-raising agreement that the committee made with Mrs. Clinton.“I’m really not involved with the Justice Department,” Mr. Trump told reporters before leaving on a 12-day trip to Asia. “I’d like to let it run itself. But honestly, they should be looking at the Democrats. They should be looking at Podesta and all of that dishonesty. They should be looking at a lot of things. And a lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.”Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump tweeted that Mrs. Clinton “stole the Democratic Primary” from Bernie Sanders and asserted that there was “major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering.”“At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper,” Mr. Trump wrote.“Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” he also tweeted.Mr. Trump’s interest in directing law enforcement decisions extends beyond his political opposition but carries its own risk. The president’s support for capital punishment for the New York terrorism suspect, Sayfullo Saipov — “SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY,” he tweeted — could pose problems for prosecutors and help defense lawyers who could argue that their client cannot get a fair trial.Mr. Trump also weighed in again on Friday on the case of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who pleaded guilty to desertion and endangering other troops by walking away from his base in Afghanistan and getting captured by the Taliban. Mr. Trump, who last year called Sergeant Bergdahl a “dirty rotten traitor” who should be executed, expressed outrage when a military judge on Friday gave the sergeant a dishonorable discharge but no jail time.“The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military,” Mr. Trump tweeted.But Mr. Trump’s own outspokenness may have helped lead to the very result he was condemning. The judge did not explain his reasoning on Friday but last week said he would consider the president’s past comments as evidence for a lighter sentence.', "TOKYO – A Japanese whose mother was abducted by North Korean agents in 1978 when he was a baby has high hopes that President Donald Trump's outreach will draw public attention to the issue.Japan says North Korea abducted at least 17 of its citizens in the 1970s and '80s to train its spies to pass as Japanese. North Korea allowed five to visit Japan in 2002, and they stayed instead of returning to North Korea.Trump is expected to meet with some relatives of the abductees during his Tokyo visit Monday.Koichiro Iizuka tells The Associated Press he hopes to be part of the meeting. He says he doesn't believe information from North Korea that his mother and seven other abductees had died.", 'It’s Donald Trump’s World. You and I Just Live Here. - The New York TimesBret Stephens: So I’m just back from Down Under, Gail. It was my first visit there, and all of my expectations were upended. “On the Beach” and the “Mad Max” series gave me a sense of Australia as the land of the apocalypse. Actually, it’s lovely and people there seem quite relaxed.Meanwhile, President Trump made a speech at the United Nations. How did things look at the edge of the abyss, East River edition?Gail Collins: Reading your column from Australia, I was wondering if you could go anywhere on the planet where the locals weren’t saying: “Oh my God, Donald Trump!” American visitors to Antarctica are probably greeted by penguins flapping their wings in alarm.Trump’s speech at the U.N. triggered a terrifying series of exchanges between our crazy president and North Korea’s crazy dictator. Back in the day, I remember doing duck-and-cover exercises in grade school and listening to the nuns announce — rather cheerfully, I felt — that the world would probably come to an end before we made it to junior high.Never thought I’d be reliving those days in the 21st century but I have to say that Trump has me wondering whether we’re heading for a real nuclear crisis.Bret: Well, when it comes to Trump, it can always get worse: As someone once said about him, he’s the sort of guy who always finds a new bottom.Look, here’s the dilemma for a person with my foreign-policy views. I think we need to take a tough line with North Korea. I believe the nuclear deal with Iran was a bad one and should be renegotiated. And I’m glad to hear an American president speak publicly about the horror unfolding in Venezuela.Problem is, that president is Trump. And I have a hard time believing that behind the rhetoric there is a strategy, much less the ability to execute it.Gail: This is no time to be backtracking on Iran. It’d just be another signal to North Korea that you can’t negotiate with Donald Trump.Bret: The other day, in Canberra, I spoke with some Australian government officials who seem to be considerably more mystified by what’s going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue than in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un? Oh, that fellow is predictable — unlike your guy. It doesn’t help that the administration still hasn’t named an ambassador to Australia. It’s no fun being an American ally in the Age of Trump.Gail: Speaking of people who can’t negotiate with the president, what’s your take on the war between the White House and the N.F.L.?Bret: For the president of the United States publicly to call someone a “son of a bitch” is horrifying. Disgusting. Disgraceful. And, of course, par for the Trumpian course.Besides, as the old line goes, it’s worse than a crime; it’s a mistake. Trump just lifted Colin Kaepernick’s star, gave N.F.L. players and owners no choice but to rally round him, and then expanded his losing fight to the N.B.A. as well. Not smart!I’m guessing we agree on this. Let’s talk about health care instead. Susan Collins says she going to vote “No” on Graham-Cassidy.Gail: And John McCain! Looks like the new health care bill is DOA. That’s the only really good news I’ve heard all month.The Graham-Cassidy bill is a disaster, unless your only goal is to take money away from states that worked hard to implement health care reform and give it to the states that didn’t bother.We haven’t discussed this but can I tell you that I’ve always disliked Lindsey Graham? He’s one of those Senators Who Can Talk to Reporters, but that doesn’t make him any less terrible.Bret: We are never going to agree on Senators: I love Graham like I loved Joe Lieberman. He’s easily one of the best legislators in Congress today, and by far the best senator South Carolina has ever produced (admittedly a low bar). His foreign policy views are basically my own, and I think he’s always approached his work with integrity and a sense of humor.Plus, I like what I’ve read about Graham-Cassidy. Retain a lot of the Obamacare subsidies, but return money and authority to the states to spend it according to their own health care needs and political predilections. I was really struck by a terrific Op-Ed in our pages by Philip Klein, the managing editor of The Washington Examiner.Key line: “Any national health care system that assumes one party will control Washington for all eternity is doomed to fail. New Yorkers would have much less to fear about a Trump presidency if the president didn’t control agencies that set policies for the entire country.”I bet that by the time this presidency is over, your favorite amendment is going to be the 10th.Gail: Actually I brought Graham up so we could have a fight. Now that you’re down on Paul Ryan, we need somebody to squabble over.I’m very cynical about states’ rights arguments. Everybody — my side included — uses it whenever the federal government does something they don’t like and drops it whenever the federal government does something they love. And the founding fathers who got so wrapped up in local control were usually worried about protecting slavery.Graham’s bill is just an attempt to get under the no-filibuster wire with Obamacare repeal. Totally cynical.Bret: Let’s keep arguing for a bit. We can disagree about the merits of the Affordable Care Act. We can’t disagree on the fact that a great deal of this country hates it. And to the extent that the A.C.A. centralizes control in Washington, we’re going to be tearing ourselves to pieces over it for a long time to come. That makes me think that Democrats should want a compromise bill like Graham-Cassidy that gives blue states the chance keep Obamacare and red states the chance to change it.I also think that there’s a bit of sneakiness on the Democratic side, too. Isn’t it true that many progressives and liberals see the A.C.A. as just a way station on the road to single payer?Gail: That’d be O.K. with me. But I see the sneakiness on the other side. Many of Obamacare’s opponents are focused on the fact that the law requires folks to buy health insurance if they can afford to.That would seem to be the most conservative position in the world. You have to take responsibility for yourself; otherwise if something bad happens you’ll probably end up in a hospital receiving extremely expensive taxpayer-funded treatment.Yet the requirement drives Republicans nuts. The same people who demand that families pay for school lunches don’t want them to have to buy health insurance.Bret: Totally agree. Republicans are so backward on this issue that they sound exactly like, um, Barack Obama when he made a devastating case against the individual mandate in one of his early debates with Hillary Clinton in 2008.Gail: True. Poor Hillary. This is what being serious about the issues will get you.Bret: O.K., I couldn’t resist sneaking that in. But the main conservative objection to Obamacare has less to do with the individual mandate than it does with the federal government’s ever-increasing hand in managing 17 percent or so of the economy.Meantime, Germany just re-elected Angela Merkel as chancellor to a fourth term. I’m curious to know your take. She’s the most successful politician in the world, the steady hand at the shaky European tiller and a feminist role model of a nonfeminist sort. Does that tell us anything important about the state of women today?Gail: You know there’s a lot of argument about whether Hillary lost because she was a woman. I think partly, probably. But in the long run I am utterly, totally confident that there will be a woman in the White House just because — they’re good at this stuff. Which Merkel demonstrates.So it’s onward and upward. Welcome home, Bret.', 'The president\'s daughter is speaking out on key issues for women around the world.If Japan’s media coverage of Ivanka Trump’s arrival in Tokyo is any indication, the country seems to be slightly obsessed with the first daughter’s high-ranking position and “great” sense of style.Trump’s arrival at the Narita International Airport on Thursday evening was covered by four television stations and treated as “major news,” according to the New York Times. The same went for her subsequent dinner plans at a swanky Tokyo restaurant.The city’s metropolitan police, too, have assigned Trump an all-female “riot squad” to protect her from overzealous admirers during the visit — and it’s the same security measure they plan to extend to first lady Melania Trump when she and President Donald Trump arrive in Japan on Nov. 5.VICTORIA BECKHAM IS ONE DESIGNER NOT OPPOSED TO DRESSING MELANIA TRUMP“Many people think she’s like a princess,” said Lully Miura, a political scientist at the University of Tokyo, in a statement to the Washington Post. “She’s well educated, beautiful, sophisticated and rich. And it’s very surprising to Japanese women that she can also talk about things that are important to society.”The DailyMail added that Japan views Ivanka as "a fashion icon" who will attract onlookers during her stay. トランプの娘〜 誕生日一緒やん🤗✨✨ #アメリカ大統領#トランプ#イヴァンカ #なんか嬉しい#向こうの誕生日パーティーは嘸かし盛大なんやろな…A post shared by Hirokazu Mizusawa (@hirokazumizusawa) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:27pm PST . . イヴァンカさん来日🇺🇸✈️🇯🇵 いらっしゃい！👍 ゆっくりしていってください🍵🍁 . . それにしても背が高いよね 180cmだと！😱 かろうじて俺のほうが高いけど、ヒール履かれたら抜かれるわ😅 . . 日本男児負けられん😤 俺も負けじとシークレット履くか👢👍😆 . . それにしても、顔小さっ！ . . #トランプ#娘#イヴァンカ#来日#日本#モデル#キレイ#綺麗#きれい#美しい#お気に入り#オシャレ#お洒落#大好き#写真#カメラ#カメラ女子 #写真好きな人と繋がりたい #instagood #instadaily #photo#photo#ivanka #trump #model #beautiful#japan #usA post shared by hiro (@_yoonjihoo_) on Nov 2, 2017 at 8:16am PDTOn Friday, Ivanka spoke at the World Assembly for Women Conference at Tokyo’s Prince Hotel, which reportedly held a lottery for attendees. The event was not as well attended as one might expect considering her popularity — Trump delivered an 18-minute speech to a partially-empty auditorium — but White House spokesman Josh Raffel said the hotel’s strict security measures kept people from getting to their seats. (A Washington Post reporter in attendance denies this was the case.) Nevertheless, the women who heard Trump’s speech seemed to view her as a role model.“She is a beautiful female leader,” Rena Hayakawa, a 21-year-old college student, told the Times. “Her fashion is great.”Another woman and former U.S. Senate staffer Mieko Nakabayashi, told the site that Ivanka’s “kind of celebrity” resonates with the Japanese people.However, it’s unclear if Ivanka’s father is looked at as favorably. In a January article in the Independent, titled “Why Japan loves Ivanka Trump,” an Ivanka-admiring blogger — who reportedly writes about the first daughter’s fashion and lifestyle for the Japan Times — hinted that not everybody is as enamored of Donald.FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS“She is a good example that a woman can do an outstanding job and handle a misogynist father like Trump, without pushing too much of a feminist agenda or confronting men too much,” said Yuriko Shinzato.“That is something that Japanese women want, but have a hard time doing in a still male-dominated society.”', "Spike Lee tells voters to 'wake up,' endorses Bernie Sanders in radio adSpike Lee declared President Donald Trump has been acting like NFL owners are “plantation owners” by urging them to fire players for kneeling to protest social injustice during the national anthem.“When he says — he is really telling the owners — like the owners are the plantation owners and the guys playing in the league, they’re on the plantation,” the 60-year-told CNN Wednesday. “You can’t say anything. And so, the thing’s really escalated.”The American film director also pointed out when Trump used an expletive to describe players who kneel or sit during the anthem.“And then I get back to it, when you talk about somebody’s mother, that’s a no-no. And he has not apologized at all, so,” said Lee. “Did he talk about the mother of the neo-Nazi, the alt-right, the KKK, those guys, crazy people in Charleston?”Lee has taken to Instagram to express his outrage.A post shared by Spike Lee (@officialspikelee) on Sep 25, 2017 at 3:14pm PDT", '                                    Actress Lena Dunham poses at Elle Magazine annual Women in Television dinner in Los Angeles, California January 13, 2015.

One such celebrity is writer and actress Lena Dunham, who continued her streak of speaking out against the president on Twitter with some incredibly harsh words of her own.In response to a thread from comedian Travon Free on Twitter, Dunham lashed out at Trump and drew a comparison between him and Dylann Roof, the mass murderer who targeted and killed nine African Americans during a Church service in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015 because of their race. That tweet has since been deleted."Not only is he a racist but he\'s a racist with untreated mental illness. So under diff circumstances he\'s Dylann Roof," the tweet read.Dunham followed up her accusatory tweet with a thread condemning the president and praising those in the NFL, which she may have confused with the NBA, who protest race relations in the U.S.“Do people get how much bravery it takes to stand up to the pres, whether you’re rich or not? These players are black Americans. Along with the president’s ire they get every violent racist who supports him. They are deluged with threats. Have no shield their families,” she writes. “I’m not an NBA player, I’m just some random white girl on cable reruns, and since the election the violence in my feed has been terrifying. Imagine their national stage, the abuse they know they’ll get for doing the right thing and the fact that they do it anyway? True applause.”It’s worth noting, as many fans did to Dunham on Twitter, that those taking a knee, an act first made popular by Colin Kaepernick, is not necessarily about Trump, but overall race relations in the U.S. particularly with police.', '                                    San Francisco 49ers players Eric Reid (35) and Colin Kaepernick (7) kneel during the national anthem before an NFL game in Santa Clara, Calif., Sept. 12, 2016.

The question became more complicated Saturday, when the White House declared Sunday to beGold Star Mother\'s and Family\'s Day, honoring families of fallen servicemembers.Just so we\'re clear: the president\'s comments will only incite more player protests, not quell them.Today is Gold Star Mother’s Day, observed on the last Sunday of September each year. #GoldStarMother pic.twitter.com/oHlSewojiwMost notably, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and several team owners – including those from the Giants, 49ers, Dolphins and Packers – issued statements Saturday in support of the league’s players and their right to express their political views.“Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players,” Goodell said in a statement.“Comments like we heard last night from the president are inappropriate, offensive and divisive,” Giants owners John Mara and Steve Tisch said in a joint statement Saturday, the New York Post reported. “We are proud of our players, the vast majority of whom use their NFL platform to make a positive difference in our society.”"Our country needs unifying leadership right now, not more diviseness," Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said in a statement.Statement from Miami Dolphins Owner and Founder of Ross Initiative in Sports for Equality (RISE) Stephen Ross. pic.twitter.com/6W3mXwJO6MMeanwhile, the hashtag #TakeAKnee and its variants became popular with many social media users.There\'s a right side & a wrong side of history. These people took a knee for the right side. We are being called to do the same. #TakeAKnee pic.twitter.com/brn9nqAjqDBut Trump wasn’t backing down from his comments made during a rally Friday in Huntsville, Ala., in which he said:“We’re proud of our country. We respect our flag. Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say get that son of a bitch off the field, right now, out? He’s fired.”In a tweet Saturday afternoon, Trump responded directly to the NFL commissioner.“Roger Goodell of the NFL just put out a statement trying to justify total disrespect certain players show to our country,” Trump tweeted. “Tell them to stand!”Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!Others, of course, have voiced support for the president\'s position.In August, NFL legend Jim Brown said kneeling during the anthem was the wrong way to protest."I\'m an American. I don\'t desecrate my flag and my national anthem," Brown said. "I\'m not gonna do anything against the flag and national anthem."Jeanine Pirro, host of “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on Fox News Channel, had some words for Goodell on her program Saturday night..@JudgeJeanine: "All of a sudden football players are lovers of the Constitution and the First Amendment — you\'re full of crap." pic.twitter.com/3SDkEi6b4H“Instead of taking sides against the national anthem, maybe you ought to think about your stockholders, your investors,” Pirro said.“The same liberals who want to protect the constitutional right of people like Colin Kaepernick to symbolically reject America by taking a knee were the ones quick to criticize Tim Tebow for bending a knee to pray and thank God on the field," Pirro added.I remember @TimTebow took a knee to pray was booted from @NFL now they take a knee in suppourt of killing police officers#BoycottNFLThe debate has stemmed from former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s protest from last season, in which he declined to stand during “The Star-Spangled Banner” as a protest against police shootings of African-Americans.Kaepernick and the 49ers parted ways after last season, and the quarterback has remained unsigned by any NFL team ever since – prompting many commentators and fans to charge that Kaepernick is being blackballed by the league.#TakeTheKnee Kaepernick is entitled to his opinion, but I\'m also entitled to mine, which is that he\'s an ideological idiot.Other players – in the NFL and other sports leagues – have sporadically staged similar protests in solidarity with Kaepernick. On Saturday, Bruce Maxwell of baseball’s Oakland A’s kneeled during the national anthem.Pitcher CC Sabathia of the New York Yankees said he would decline an invitation to the White House if he were to receive one, the New York Daily News reported.Trump has been directly embroiled in disputes with some of those other sports as well – most notably pro basketball.The president recently withdrew a White House invitation from NBA star Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors, who were expected to celebrate last season’s championship in a visit to Washington, D.C.College basketball’s champions, the North Carolina Tar Heels, said they would not attend a White House ceremony to recognize their NCAA title, the Washington Post reported.Fox News’ Alex Pappas and the Associated Press contributed to this story.', '', '', '', '                                    President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at the Presidential Palace in Hanoi, Vietnam, Nov. 12, 2017.

As currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.”The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia interfered in the election to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump had said that Putin again vehemently denied the allegations -- this time during an economic summit in Vietnam. Trump said he believed “that when he tells me that, he means it.”Trump had also dismissed former U.S. intelligence officials as “political hacks” and accused Democrats of using the issue to try to sabotage relations between the two countries, putting lives at risk.But Trump’s Saturday comments drew sharp criticism in the United States, with U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and others asserting that the president seemed to side with Putin over U.S. intelligence professionals, Politico reported.At the news conference, Trump reiterated his view that it\'s crucial for the U.S. to get along with Russia, and seemed to suggest that it was time to remove the sanctions Congress has slapped on Russia in retaliation for its election meddling efforts.“It\'s now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken," said Trump. "Those are very important things.”As he traveled to Hanoi, the second-to-last stop of his Asia trip, Trump told reporters that Putin "said he absolutely did not meddle in our election. He did not do what they are saying he did."“Every time he sees me, he said: `I didn\'t do that.\' And I believe -- I really believe -- that when he tells me that, he means it," Trump said, calling the accusation an "artificial barrier" erected by Democrats.The president lashed out at the former heads of the nation\'s intelligence community, and said there were plenty of reasons to be suspicious of their findings.“I mean, give me a break. They\'re political hacks," Trump said, citing by name James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, John Brennan, the former CIA director and his ousted ex-FBI director James Comey, whom Trump said was "proven now to be a liar and he\'s proven to be a leaker.”In a tweet sent Sunday from Hanoi, Trump bashed the "haters and fools" he said are questioning his efforts to improve relations with Russia and accused critics of "playing politics" and hurting the country.Trump\'s comments about Putin and "political hacks" brought criticism from lawmakers with ties to the intelligence community.U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is his party\'s top member on the House\'s intelligence committee, said in a statement that Trump "fools no one" and that the president understands how the Russians intervened through hacking, social media and their own television coverage of the presidential race.McCain, the GOP’s presidential nominee in 2008, said in a statement that Trump\'s faith in Putin\'s denial was "naive.""There\'s nothing ‘America First\' about taking the word of a KGB colonel over that of the American intelligence community," McCain wrote, referring to Putin\'s former career in Soviet intelligence. "Vladimir Putin does not have America\'s interests at heart."Trump was in Hanoi for a brief state visit, including Sunday\'s meeting with Quang at the presidential palace.In brief remarks after his arrival, Trump offered help negotiating with China on disputes over the South China Sea. Beijing\'s island-building there has drawn criticism from Washington, which argues the U.S. has a national interest in freedom of navigation in sea lanes critical for world trade. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier this month said China\'s "provocative actions" challenged international law and norms.“If I can help mediate or arbitrate, please let me know," Trump offered. "I\'m a very good mediator and a very good arbitrator. I\'ve done plenty of it from both sides."The Associated Press contributed to this story.', 'TOKYO – U.S. first lady Melania Trump has tried her hand at Japanese calligraphy at a Tokyo elementary school.She visited the school Monday with her Japanese counterpart, Akie Abe.

Former FBI Director James Comey said that though Clinton and her aides were “extremely careless” in their handling of classified information, there was no evidence that anyone intended to break the law. He recommended against prosecution.Trump argued during the campaign that Clinton deserved to be prosecuted and has continued to suggest that even after being elected president.

Presidents throughout the years have dispatched their duties with a quip or two, and a great show of mercy. But suddenly, the media is worried President Trump might not be up to the task.NPR published a story proclaiming that it should be “interesting to watch” because it’s “a lighthearted event, but Trump isn\'t known for his public laughter,” while the Boston Globe published an opinion piece imagining what is going on inside the president’s head before the event that is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in the Rose Garden.“A lot of people think President Truman pardoned the first turkey, but he ate it, and in keeping with that great presidential tradition, and in keeping with my administration’s new tradition of truly horrifying, unthinkable practices and beliefs… I’ve decided not to pardon the Thanksgiving turkey,” the Globe’s Debra Klein wrote, while attempting to channel Trump.Anti-gun advocate Shannon Watts posted a poll on her Twitter account that asks, “Donald Trump will be the first President not to pardon the Thanksgiving turkey,” with choices being “yes,” “no,” and “his sons will shoot it.”A quick search of social media reveals several versions of lame attempts at humor such as, “Who wants to bet that Trump won’t pardon the Thanksgiving turkey this year and eats it instead?” Another user predicted that Trump will mistake turkeys for peacocks and call NBC fake news.A Twitter user billed as the “stay at home pundit” tweeted, “It wouldn’t shock me if the turkey looked at trump and said ‘You know what?

Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas,even tweeted the president probably “put more thought into which turkey to pardon than how to actually lower taxes for the middle class.”CNN’s “State of the Union” featured a Jake Tapper cartoon mocking the entire process and asking if some of Trump’s friends will be “envious” of the pardoned birds. A stab at a straight-news story on the liberal CNN\'s website included the irrelevant fact that “Trump\'s most notorious interaction with a bird, a bald eagle used for a Time magazine photo shoot two years ago, didn\'t go so well,” a reference to when the national bird didn’t cooperate during a 2015 photo session.Many of the jokes are related former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who Trump actually pardoned, or LaVar Ball, who the president recently called “ungrateful” after the outspoken father downplayed the White House’s role in freeing his son, LiAngelo, and a pair of UCLA teammates after they were caught shoplifting in China.A satirical website circulated an article titled, “President Trump orders the execution of five turkeys pardoned by Obama,” and The New York Times recently had to inform its readers the story wasn’t true.

REUTERS/Pedro Nunes - RC1326060460                                                                    A data firm that worked for President Donald Trump\'s campaign reached out to WikiLeaks during the campaign about obtaining emails related to Democrat Hillary Clinton, the company\'s CEO said. Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica, said the approach was in "early June 2016" after WikiLeaks Editor Julian Assange had publicly claimed he had Clinton emails and planned to publish them. Nix said his company asked a speaker\'s agency representing Assange whether WikiLeaks "might share that information," but Assange turned him down. Nix\'s comments Thursday at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon, Portugal, were his first acknowledgement that he had sought emails from WikiLeaks. Assange had previously told The Associated Press that WikiLeaks had rejected a "request for information" from Cambridge Analytica. The Wall Street Journal first reported Nix\'s comments. Cambridge Analytica\'s role in the president\'s campaign has caught the attention of congressional committees probing Russia\'s interference in the 2016 election and any possible coordination with Trump associates. The company is backed by Robert Mercer, a billionaire Trump supporter. Before joining the Trump administration, former White House strategist Steve Bannon also served as a vice president at the company. The Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica nearly $6 million for data management. The campaign\'s first payment to the company was on July 29, 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records. But the Journal reported Friday that Nix\'s outreach to WikiLeaks came while Cambridge Analytica was in contract negotiations with the campaign in June. At that time, the company had already sent some of its employees to help the campaign, the Journal reported. A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica and a related company, SCL Group, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. During the Web Summit interview, Nix denied that his company was involved in any Russian election meddling. "We did no work with Russia in this election. And moreover, we would never work with a third-party state actor in another country\'s election campaign," he said. He also called the outreach to Assange "very benign." He said it stemmed from an article in The Guardian newspaper in early June 2016 that said "WikiLeaks was going to publish a huge amount of information that could be very relevant to the election and could impact it sincerely." Nix appeared to be referencing a June 12, 2016, article that was based on Assange\'s comment to a British television network that WikiLeaks had "upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton" that were in the form of emails. On Thursday, Nix said that after he saw the article, he asked his "office to reach out to, actually it was a speaking agency that represents Julian Assange to ask if he might share that information with us and we received a message back from them that he didn\'t want to or wasn\'t able to." "And that was the end of the matter," Nix added. Last month, Assange confirmed that WikiLeaks was approached by Cambridge Analytica prior to November 2016 but he declined to provide specifics about the interaction, other than saying it was a "request for information." Assange\'s comments came in response to a story from The Daily Beast that reported that Nix\'s outreach was about possibly obtaining the 33,000 emails that Clinton said were deleted from her private server. Those emails have never been released.', '', '', '', 'Trump Hits a Favorite Punching Bag, CNN - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump returned from his Thanksgiving break with new attacks on his least favorite news network, CNN, and suggested a contest for the “most dishonest” media outlet.In a series of Twitter posts over the weekend and early Monday, Mr. Trump criticized CNN’s international arm for representing “our nation to the WORLD very poorly.” The president praised Fox News and has been complimentary of its coverage of him and his administration.CNN responded in a Twitter post that it is “not CNN’s job to represent the U.S. to the world. That’s yours.”It is unusual for a president to so openly endorse one news source over others. Mr. Trump has campaigned against CNN for months, and his administration is involved in an antitrust case that could potentially put CNN into the hands of more Trump-friendly media moguls.Christiane Amanpour, a CNN reporter, responded to the president’s Twitter post with a reminder that journalists give their lives to “covering the facts and truth.” Ms. Amanpour posted a picture of her late camerawoman, Margaret Moth, who was seriously injured in 1992 while covering the conflict in Bosnia.On Monday, Mr. Trump suggested that a contest “as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me).” He said the winner would receive a “FAKE NEWS TROPHY!”Former national security executives also reacted to the president’s favoritism on Twitter.“If you favor CNN OR Fox and are not dismayed by this, you may now be numb and no longer capable of outrage. Scary if that’s our new normal,” John E. McLaughlin, a former deputy director and acting director of the C.I.A., wrote in a Twitter post on Saturday.Michael V. Hayden, a former director of both the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency, said, “Until now it was not possible for me to conceive of an American President capable of such an outrageous assault on truth, a free press or the first amendment.”', '', "Steve Bannon spoke at a New York City luncheon sponsored by the Gatestone Institute.In a blistering assault on the Republican establishment and President Donald Trump’s political adversaries, former White House advisor Steve Bannon predicted there will be an effort to impeach the president if Republicans lose the House.“Donald Trump is a blunt force instrument,” Bannon said.In a wide-ranging speech that touched on the rise of China, the dangers of Turkish President Recep Erdoğan and the threat from radical Islamic terrorism, the controversial political advisor said he thinks Trump’s opponents simply are working to throw him out of office.“When I left the White House the very first thing I said is that I’m going after the Republican establishment, because they are trying to nullify this as much as the left.”He warned that the political battle will play out through next year.“The constitutional struggle that we are going to have in 2018 and the lead up to it, is going to be brutal, a brutal midterm election. It is going to be something unprecedented in American history,”Bannon predicted.“If we get crushed, the first thing that they are going to do in the House of Representatives, they are going to impeach Donald J. Trump, I don’t care what they say.”Bannon spoke at a New York City luncheon event sponsored by the Gatestone Institute, a “non-partisan, not for profit international policy council and think tank, dedicated to educating the public about what the media fails to report,” it says.“Mr. Bannon seems concerned about international threats facing America,” said Gatestone’s President Nina Rosenwald, who invited him as part of the group’s fall lecture series. “We thought he might bring up topics that need addressing that nobody else is looking at.”“We have the ability to put together a coalition that can govern for 50 years,” Bannon told the audience, but warned of a potential G.O.P. defeat because he believes that the ruling-party powers are not connected to average Americans.“The establishment is not prepared, they don’t have a sense of urgency, and they don’t understand the working class people in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, in Michigan, in Minnesota and in Iowa and Ohio. What we did we can replicate. We can replicate it, though, with hard work, and wisdom. And if we blow this, we are never going to get it back. You have to understand, it is never coming back. We have the ability to change this country.”Bannon, who is supporting some insurgent candidates in upcomingRepublican primaries, did not delve into the growing sexual misconduct allegations surrounding Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. Bannon supported Moore over President Trump’s primary pick, the incumbent Senator Luther Strange, and only mentioned the controversy briefly. He cited it as an example of what he considers the establishment’s panic.“They’re petrified of the opposition party. You know what my super power is? I don’t give a damn. I could care less what they say about me. I could care less. It’s about action. The Republican Party and the leaders of the Republican Party are cowards. You are writing your checks to cowards. Understand this. They are there for you when it’s easy. They are there to take your check. But when something comes up like the Iran situation, they will flip the Constitution of the United States so they can have some sort of conscience for voting for that —it’s outrageous.”He said that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell “owes his job to Donald Trump,” noting that it was Trump’s wins that swept the G.O.P. into the Senate majority.“Wisconsin, Missouri and North Carolina were all dead in the water. They were brought across the goal line by Donald Trump. Mitch McConnell had a terrible track record of picking people to run.”Bannon also used his Gatestone appearance to remind the attendees of the Trump administration success against ISIS, both on the battlefield and squeezing the financial pipeline that supports terrorism.“We crushed the Caliphate of ISIS ... in 2014, the ISIS Caliphate was eight million people. It had oil fields, it had wheat fields, it had taxation, and was recruiting actively in Europe and recruiting actively in the United States. He has physically destroyed the Caliphate. If you listen to the morning talk shows, you would think that all President Trump is doing is just following Obama’s plan. It couldn’t be farther from the truth. He told General Mattis, not a war of attrition, I want a war of annihilation. I want to physically destroy the Caliphate in Mosul, in Raqqa and other cities. He’s done that, and I don’t think he’s gotten the credit.”“The region is starting to clean up the element in the region that works with, supports and finances exporting radical Islamic terrorism to Western Europe and the United States.”He also warned that the U.S. has to face Iranian expansion in the Middle East.Fox News' Ben Evansky contributed to this report.Follow Eric Shawn on Twitter:@EricShawnTV", 'Trump Names Supreme Court Candidates for a Nonexistent Vacancy - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — No sitting justice on the Supreme Court has indicated plans to leave any time soon.But tell that to President Trump, who announced on Friday his latest slate of judicial candidates to fill a vacancy that — as far as anyone knows — does not exist.As a presidential hopeful, Mr. Trump released a list of 21 names of judges (and one politician) and promised not to stray from it should he win the election and be in a position to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016. After taking office, Mr. Trump named Neil M. Gorsuch, a federal appellate judge who had been on his original list, to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat.On Friday afternoon, with little explanation, Mr. Trump added five names to the list.If he again gets the chance to fill a vacancy on the nation’s highest court, Mr. Trump said that he would now consider two additional state judges, two newly minted federal appeals court judges and a veteran federal judge thought by many to be a leading contender despite being left off the president’s original list.Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was a striking omission from the president’s original list. One administration official has said in the past that Judge Kavanaugh would be a leading candidate should Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, 81, decide to step down. Judge Kavanaugh is now officially on the list.Others added on Friday were Justice Britt C. Grant of the Georgia Supreme Court; Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit; Justice Patrick R. Wyrick of the Oklahoma Supreme Court; and Judge Kevin C. Newsom of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.Mr. Trump’s new candidates add to a roster of committed judicial conservatives compiled by Donald F. McGahn II, Mr. Trump’s longtime election lawyer and now the White House counsel, with help from two leading conservative policy groups: the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society.“If you’re going to be committed to picking from a list, it’s really important that the list remain current and complete,” said Leonard Leo, a top executive at the Federalist Society and an influential conservative who has closely advised Mr. Trump on judicial appointments.White House officials said the addition of the names was routine and was simply an effort to “refresh” a list that had not changed in more than a year. Even so, the announcement was a reminder of the advanced age of Justice Kennedy and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 84. If either one — or another justice — leaves the bench in the next three years, Mr. Trump will be in a position to pick a replacement.“These additions, like those on the original list released more than a year ago, were selected with input from respected conservative leaders,” the White House said in a statement.The Federalist Society was holding its  National Lawyers Convention this week in Washington, and the announcement from the president provided a bit of conservative legal buzz among the attendees.Mr. McGahn addressed the group on Friday evening, and he named the five new candidates, saying they were committed conservative judges in the mold of Justice Scalia. Judge Kavanaugh received the most sustained applause.That may have been part of the motivation for releasing the list on Friday. Several conservative groups issued statements praising the expanded roster of court prospects.“These are stellar additions to the existing list of Supreme Court potentials,” said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a leading libertarian think tank.', 'Trump Voters, Writ Large - The New York TimesTo the Editor:Re “The Trump Voter Paradox” (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Sept. 28):Thomas B. Edsall cites scholars positing the idea that Trump supporters have low tolerance for views that contradict their community values. The problem arises when these values are wrong.For example, a community that believes that climate change is a hoax, that homosexuality is a choice and that evolution is not real is certainly not a community that I would wish to join. But these people vote, and when they join with others with like beliefs, a result is a disaster like Donald Trump.If this happened in a small inconsequential country, the potential for damage to the world would be minimal. But this has occurred in the most powerful country in the world, where our misguided policies will affect hundreds of millions of people and threaten civilization.RICHARD AMBRON, GREAT NECK, N.Y.', 'President, Senate majority leader look to move past bumpy relationship to accelerate agenda; Mike Emanuel reports from Washington, D.C.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to sit down with President Donald Trump Monday in a White House meeting that could help patch their relationship, which fractured in a big way over the summer, when the two leaders took shots at each other over health care reform and the effectiveness of Congress.Back in August, Trump said he was “very disappointed in Mitch,” after McConnell said Trump had “excessive expectations” about the legislative process.The meeting comes as conservative groupsdemand McConnell step downfrom his leadership role.“We call on all five members of the GOP Senate leadership to step down, or for their caucus to remove them as soon as possible,” Ken Cuccinelli, the former attorney general of Virginia who now leads the Senate Conservatives Fund, said Wednesday on Capitol Hill.McConnell “will join the President and Vice President for a working lunch where they will discuss the fall agenda which includes completing the budget resolution, passing tax reform to help American families and workers, confirming well-qualified judicialand other nominees, and continuing to provide resources to communities affected by the recent hurricanes,” the Senate GOP leader\'s spokesman David Popp told Fox News.Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to Trump, said Saturday in a speech to religious conservatives that he’s committed to dumping McConnell.Bannon put on notice some of those incumbents who are at risk of a challenge from his flank of the party. He said lawmakers possibly can avoid that wrath if they disavow McConnell and meet other conditions."This is our war," Bannon said. "The establishment started it. ... You all are gonna finish it."In this Sept. 5, 2017 file photo, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., right, listens as President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Congressional leaders and administration officials in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said, “Mitch McConnell’s not our problem. Our problem is that we promised to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and we failed. We promised to cut taxes and we have yet to do it.”The senator added: "If we\'re successful, Mitch McConnell\'s fine. If we\'re not, we\'re all in trouble. We lose our majority and I think President Trump will not get reelected."Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate from Maine who was a critical “no” vote on health care, said Bannon’s rhetoric is what Americans are tired of."They don\'t want this hyperpartisanship. They want us to work together. And they want us to get things done," she said.Collins added that "over-the-top rhetoric is not helpful. Mitch McConnell is the Senate majority leader. The president needs him. I\'m glad they\'re working together on tax reform and a lot of other issues. And I\'m glad they\'re meeting this week."In August, Trumptweeted blamefor failure to repeal ObamaCare on McConnell, saying, “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!”McConnell responded to Trump’s Twitter barrage by saying the challenges of governing shouldn’t be a surprise."A lot of people look at all that and find it frustrating, messy. Well, welcome to the democratic process. That\'s the way it is in our country," McConnell said at a GOP event in Kentucky this summer.Meanwhile, the senators’ weeklong recess also drew criticism from the White House."They\'re on another vacation right now. I think that we would all be a lot better off if the Senate would stop taking vacations, and start staying here until we actually get some real things accomplished," Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.Recently, a McConnell-backed political committee spent millions and Trump endorsed Alabama Sen. Luther Strange in a recent primary election, but Bannon-backed Roy Moore prevailed. Moore, a former judge, has defied federal court orders, described Islam as a false religion and called homosexuality evil.Senate Republicans had been upbeat about adding to their 52-48 edge in the chamber, especially with Democrats defending more seats next year— 10 in states Trump won in last year\'s presidential election. But the Bannon challenge could cost them, leaving incumbents on the losing end in primaries or GOP candidates roughed up for the general election."If we don\'t cut taxes and we don\'t eventually repeal and replace ObamaCare, then we\'re going to lose across the board in the House in 2018. And all of my colleagues running in primaries in 2018 will probably get beat. It will be the end of Mitch McConnell as we know it. So this is a symptom of a greater problem," Graham said.He added that Bannon "can\'t beat us if we\'re successful. And if we\'re not successful, it doesn\'t matter who tries to beat us, they\'ll be successful."Fox News\' Mike Emanuel and The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'Preet Bharara Is Not Running for Office - The New York TimesYou went from being the most famous and powerful United States attorney in the country to hosting a weekly podcast about justice. No offense, but some people might consider that a slight step down. Wow. How much of a descent is that? Look, if I had never become the United States attorney, I would have lived a full and happy and unregretful life. The happiest day of my professional life was becoming an assistant U.S. attorney, because I always wanted to have a position where the only job is to do the right thing. Becoming U.S. attorney was gravy on top of all that. But at some point, you’ve got to leave.I’ll bet a lot of people think you were a district attorney. If you’re at a cocktail party and someone gets your job title wrong, do you correct them? If it’s a formal event, I will probably gently correct. But I’m more likely to have my last name mispronounced.I think it’s fair to say that the longer Trump is in power, the better your podcast will do. Would you trade podcast success for an early Trump retirement? Would I happily talk about other social, political, legal issues — which might cause fewer people to listen to the podcast — in exchange for the president of the United States not embarrassing us and not undermining democratic institutions on a daily basis? Absolutely yes. But this is what’s happening in America right now. I don’t feel like I have any choice.But the podcast has to be a pit stop for you on your way to elected office, right? I don’t think I would enjoy politics in any shape or form. The way I say it respectfully — as an Indian-American and given the tea-drinking habits of my parents — it’s not my cup of tea.Is there something in particular that turns you off about politics? I find the play of money in politics to be not only disgusting and conducive to all sorts of corruption but also personally distasteful. The idea of calling friends and acquaintances for several hours every day to raise money for a race doesn’t float my boat.Your convictions of Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos — the former New York State Assembly speaker and the former State Senate majority leader — were recently vacated thanks to an 8-0 Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the definition of public corruption. Did eight Supreme Court justices get it wrong? I tend to agree with the commentators who have said the decision is a little bit naïve. But if you spend all your time sort of under the covers fuming about what the people in robes do, you wouldn’t get out of bed on some days.You once heard Dean Skelos’s son on a wiretap saying, and I quote, “It’s like [expletive] Preet Bharara is listening to every [expletive] phone call.” How hard did you laugh when you heard that? I laughed very robustly.Do you consider yourself part of the “resistance”? No. I don’t know what that term means. I consider myself a private citizen who cares about the country.I’m going to ask you the same question you asked one of your guests. Say you’re a member of Congress. Based solely on what we publicly know today, would you vote to impeach Donald Trump? The closest I’ve come to setting a threshold for what I think would merit impeachment is if he were to cause Bob Mueller to be fired. That would be the equivalent or worse than the Saturday Night Massacre. Given the accumulation of all sorts of other ways that Donald Trump has flouted the rule of law, that’s just a bridge too far.Let’s say that Trump does get impeached. How are you celebrating that night? This is going to sound not credible to some people: I don’t know that I’d be celebrating. To me, the most somber thing that happens in civilian life is when a jury comes back for a verdict in a criminal case: That moment is an illustration that people do bad things, and that justice is necessary, but it’s awful that it’s necessary. It’s not the same thing, but if we got to the point where the president of the United States has to be impeached on a bipartisan basis, it will be gratifying in some ways, if it’s responsible and deserved, but it will also be very sad.', '\'Nuclear Showdown: North Korea takes on the World\' author Gordon Chang and former Army special forces Jim Hanson react.Editor\'s note:The following column originally appeared inThe Resurgent.For more reasons that you might expect, I think we should all be thankful for the President. I know I am thankful.President Trump is not perfect. He was not my choice to be President. But I am thankful for him in many ways.I appreciate that President Trump has brought about the great sorting of the conservative movement. Though disappointing to see, it has confirmed for me that the nation is not as conservative as I once thought and also that there are a lot of people who have made a lot of money in the conservative movement who do not really believe in the ideals of conservatism.President Trump has made me recommit to my faith. I could be distracted by politics for the longest time, but seeing the country headed toward the darkness with many so called conservatives cheering on the dark, I have been forced to reprioritize things. I have realized how much of my politics and faith do not align and how many Christian conservatives have worked very hard to conform their faith to their politics instead of the other way around.The richest reward in the age of Donald Trump is a clearer vision of the country and a greater appreciation for the necessity of relying on God, not men.I am thankful he put Neil Gorsuch on the bench. I am thankful for many of the President\'s policies and stellar personnel appointments like Ajit Pai, Justice Willett, Nikki Haley, Rick Perry, General Mattis, etc.Though it has not happened to the extent I would like, President Trump\'s election has forced some Democrats to finally realize what conservatives were talking about when they said character counted. It has not been good on the GOP side now, but some Democrats are finally having to recognize it. Likewise, Democrats are starting to realize that defending President Obama\'s legacy at the expense of reality may not be the greatest thing. It will take further time for this to shake out, but from Iran to Russia to North Korea, at least privately Democrats are starting to acknowledge Barack Obama\'s failures.Though not an exhaustive list, there is one last thing I am thankful of because of President Trump. There are people in the old center-right coalition who I may not see eye to eye with at times, but I have a new appreciation for their willingness to stand up. Even now, we do not always agree on things, but it has been nice to see people make it through the great sorting with their integrity intact. I have always had respect and rare disagreement with people like Jonah Goldberg and Bill Kristol, but add into mix with them people like Charlie Sykes and others it is refreshing to see people focus on ideas on the right, not just the cult of personality.The richest reward in the age of Donald Trump is a clearer vision of the country and a greater appreciation for the necessity of relying on God, not men. This clarifying moment would not have come except for Donald Trump\'s election and it is clear the turmoil, problems, and opportunism of many were always there festering.Erick Erickson is a Fox News contributor.

Minutes after the president’s address, the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who rarely engages the press at the world body, came out and read a statement that in part criticized the president’s new policy on Jerusalem.“From day one as Secretary-General of the United Nations, I have consistently spoken out against any unilateral measures that would jeopardize the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians,” Guterres said.While taking no questions from reporters, Guterres said there can be no other way to peace other than the two-state solution: “In this moment of great anxiety, I want to make it clear — there is no alternative to the two-state solution. There is no Plan B.”Seven members of the U.N. Security Council have requested an emergency meeting on Jerusalem that could come as early as Friday. Those members include the U.K, France, Egypt and Sweden.Earlier in the day, an outspoken critic of the U.S. and Israel, Ambassador Sacha Llorentty-Soliz of Bolivia, told reporters if Trump went ahead with his decision, it would threaten the peace process and would be “a reckless and a dangerous decision that goes against international law and resolutions of the Security Council.”While President-elect, Trump took aim at the U.N.’s anti-Israel stance following passage of U.N. Resolution 2334, a legally binding U.N. Security Council resolution that said Israel’s presence in parts of Jerusalem was illegal. The December 2016 vote resulted in the Obama administration famously changing decades of U.S. policy by refusing to veto the anti-Israel measure that said settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem was a fragrant violation of international law.The United Nations may hold an emergency meeting after President Donald Trump declared the holy city Jerusalem as Israel’s capital Wednesday. The flag of Israel is seen near the flag of the US in this photo.(Fox News)A few days after the resolution passed, Trump tweeted that, “We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but…” he continued, “not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!”A longtime Republican foreign policy advisor close to the White House told Fox News on background that, “The Obama administration secretly helped draft and pass the December 2016 resolution denying Israel’s connection to Jerusalem. President-elect Trump immediately blasted the resolution and promised to end that nonsense. His speech today is exactly what he promised. It is an arrow aimed at the heart of U.N. bias against Israel. “Concerns over the Security Council resolution and anti-Israel bias have been a consistent feature of U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley’s tenure in New York.Haley released a statement on the president’s decision calling the move a “courageous and historic step.” Haley, who visited Israel in June, added, “Across the globe, America has its embassy in the capital city of the host country. Israel will now be no different. It is the just and right thing to do.”Eugene Kontorovich, head of international law at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a Jerusalem think tank, has testified to Congress on the subject, and said Trump’s decision on Jerusalem is the right one.“President Trump has complete authority under U.S. and international law to recognize Jerusalem on behalf of the U.S.,” Kontorovich said. “U.N Sec. Res 2344 is entirely non-binding. Nothing in international law prevents this. Moreover, the president has complete constitutional power to recognize Jerusalem as Israeli, as the Supreme Court ruled a few years ago in the Jerusalem passport case.”Kontorovich, who is a professor of international and constitutional law at Northwestern University, continued, “This is a bold and historic decision, comparable to the President Truman’s recognition of Israel as a state 70 years ago. It rectifies a longstanding absurdity and injustice — treating the capital of the Jewish state as not even part of the country. It also breaks the racist international consensus that holds that Jews cannot live in their holy city’s ancient precincts. It also firmly rejects the view that the 1949 Armistice Lines have any legal status or legitimacy.”Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the world body, hailed Trump’s decision as historic and called on other nations to follow.“Now is the time for all U.N. member-states to follow the lead of our American friends and recognize our ancient capital of Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel,” he said.Ben Evansky reports for Fox Newson the United Nations and international affairs.He can befollowed@BenEvansky', "DANANG, Vietnam – President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from a far-reaching Pacific Rim trade pact is having scant impact on fast-growing trade in the region.As Trump heads for an annual regional summit in Vietnam, the 11 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership are working on a new agreement without U.S. A rival trade grouping is gaining ground.

LEE, NEW HAVENThe writer is a forensic psychiatrist at the Yale School of Medicine.', 'Can We Please Stop Talking About ‘Collusion’? - The New York TimesWithin hours after the American public found out that his most senior campaign official was under an indictment that described him as a secret agent of Russian interests, President Trump declared on Twitter: “There is NO COLLUSION!” A forceful statement if there ever was one. But what exactly was he denying so categorically? We have no idea.For one reason or another, “collusion” has become the term of choice for discussing what the Trump campaign may or may not have done with Russians. Those in the Trump camp use it regularly: “I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government,” Jared Kushner told Congress this summer. “I did not collude with any foreign government,” Donald Trump Jr. said. “I deeply resent any allegation that I would collude with the oppressive Russian state,” the Republican strategist Roger Stone harrumphed.It isn’t just those in the Trump camp, though, who have settled on using this word. Among the first to refer to collusion was John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, who raised the specter on “Meet the Press”: “I would argue that there’s very, it’s very much unknown whether there was collusion.” In that same week, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said of Trump campaign connections to WikiLeaks, “So there is collusion there, clearly.” The term has been a touchstone ever since.Mr. Trump and his inner circle have benefited enormously from this coalescing around the word “collusion” — a term with a legalistic feel but with close to “no legal meaning whatsoever” said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor and now a defense lawyer who has written a dissection of every public statement that a Trump associate has made to congressional investigators. If we care about the law — and about holding public figures accountable for their false denials — the impassioned disavowals of collusion by members of the Trump circle mean nothing. Donald Trump Jr.’s utterances to Congress, for example, were “not denying that he committed a crime,” Mr. Mariotti said. “Whether his denial is broader or more narrow than that depends on what exactly is meant by ‘collude’ in this statement — which we don’t know.”What might the term “collusion” actually mean? Mr. Mariotti and I may disagree on a small technicality; it does have some legal meaning. It is found in one place in the federal code, in the area of antitrust law, concerning practices such as price-fixing. But that’s no help. To transpose the antitrust framework onto issues of election interference would require metaphor gymnastics.Outside the legal definition, collusion might mean something along the lines of conspiracy and complicity. And we should not care only about whether Mr. Trump’s actions were inside or outside the boundaries of the law. The impeachment clause of the Constitution certainly doesn’t (you can be impeached for violating the public’s sacred trust without committing a crime). The sheer offensiveness of the action is what’s more important.But the integrity of even this idea has been degraded by the ready mixing of the term with legal concepts (notions of “proof” of collusion and ideas of “criminal collusion”).The problem is that the focus on the term “collusion” has had the effect of implying precision where there is essentially none. Meeting the standard of “proof of collusion” isn’t a matter of meeting a technical definition or threshold — it is a matter of persuading enough people that what we’re seeing is collusion. It is, in other words, a political judgment and, as with all things political, is extraordinarily subjective and vulnerable to all sorts of manipulations. The fuzziness of the current discourse may not matter much to the F.B.I., whose investigation will surely adhere to the letter of the law — but it might matter a great deal for how its findings play in the court of public opinion.The use of the word has, for instance, allowed members of Congress handling the Russia investigation to tell us that they have not seen a scintilla of evidence of “collusion.” We now know that these congressional members had long been told by American intelligence officials that advisers to Mr. Trump might be working with the Russians to interfere in the election. That’s what use of the word “collusion” helped keep hiddenThe term’s elusiveness has also allowed for an easy shifting of goal posts. Back in June, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to say that President Barack Obama was the one who “colluded” with the Kremlin to interfere with the election. When a reporter pressed the question — “what evidence does he have that President Obama was colluding?” — the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, responded that Obama insiders “knew about it and didn’t take any action.” If that were the standard for collusion, then if people on Mr. Trump’s campaign were aware of Russian possession of stolen emails and did nothing, they’d have no defense against allegations of collusion. But they do — because the term comes with no consensus as to its definition.We have now surely lost touch with any reasonable sense of what “collusion” means. If we, as a country, knew a year ago what’s now understood to be an avalanche of well-reported facts, published emails and legal documentation, the behavior of the president’s family and associates would have crossed any reasonable line of what might be meant by an attempt to collude with the Kremlin.Mr. Trump might have won anyway without Vladimir Putin’s help. That’s not the issue. The issue is that the behavior of Mr. Trump and his associates amounts to a deep offense against the public’s sacred trust. We need to reckon not only with that fact, but also with how as a nation, we’ve almost lost the sense to recognize it.', 'White House Says Charges Against Campaign Advisers Do Not Touch Trump - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump and his representatives on Monday dismissed the charges leveled against three former campaign advisers, saying none of them proved that he had colluded with Russia last year to influence the presidential election.The White House said that the indictment of Paul J. Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman, and Rick Gates, his deputy, as well as the guilty plea of George Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser, had nothing to do with Mr. Trump or his election operation. Instead, it sought to refocus attention on Democrats and their actions during the campaign.“Today’s announcement has nothing to do with the president, has nothing to do with the president’s campaign or campaign activity,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. Responding to questions at her daily briefing, she said, “We’ve been saying from Day 1 there’s been no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all.”Jay Sekulow, a private attorney for Mr. Trump, said the president and his legal team were not worried about the indictments, which could be used by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to seek testimony that could implicate other targets.“No, not concerned,” Mr. Sekulow said on CNN. “I’m completely convinced, as I was from the outset, that not only was there no Russian collusion, there was no obstruction.” He added: “I’m not concerned about this at all and no one else is either.”On Twitter, Mr. Trump reacted only to the indictment of Mr. Manafort on tax fraud, money laundering and foreign lobbying violations, arguing that it was not relevant to the campaign since it dealt with prior private business.In the first of two tweets, Mr. Trump wrote: “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????”In a second tweet minutes later, Mr. Trump added: “....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”He made no comment on the guilty plea by Mr. Papadopoulos, who admitted lying to the F.B.I. about his efforts to connect Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russian government officials.At her briefing, Ms. Sanders repeatedly insisted that Mr. Papadopoulos was just “a volunteer” in the president’s campaign, and she played down his role by saying that he was “a volunteer member of an advisory council that literally met one time.”Ms. Sanders insisted that Trump campaign officials rebuffed all of his efforts to put them in touch with Russians. “You mean the outreach that was repeatedly denied, and pushed away?” she said. “He reached out and nothing happened beyond that.”His guilty plea, she said, was unrelated to his campaign efforts. “It has nothing to do with the activities of the campaign,” Ms. Sanders said. “It has to do with his failure to tell the truth that doesn’t have anything to do with the campaign or the campaign’s activities.”Democrats jumped on the indictments, showing no hesitation to link the allegations against Trump campaign aides to Mr. Trump himself.“We know today that the Trump presidential campaign was run by a Russian foreign agent now charged with conspiring against the United States,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. “This indictment is a sober, shattering moment and a major step toward answers and accountability for the American people. The president now owes the American people a serious explanation of his decision to hire Manafort and his own knowledge of this conspiracy.”Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, keyed in Mr. Papadopoulos, who “pleaded guilty to lying to F.B.I. investigators about his contacts with a Russian individual with ‘substantial connections’ with Russian government officials who discussed possessing ‘dirt’ on then-candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.”“These indictments and guilty plea demonstrate beyond any doubt that this is a consequential investigation, and it must be allowed to move forward without political interference,” he said in a statement.Ms. Sanders said that Mr. Manafort and the president have not spoken in months. She said that Mr. Gates had been at the White House several times since the inauguration, but she declined to say for certain whether Mr. Trump had spoken to Mr. Gates.“I know that there was some initial contact after the president was sworn in,” she said, but said that she was not certain there was anything “directly with the president.”Both Ms. Sanders and Mr. Sekulow disputed suggestions that Mr. Trump might seek to fire Mr. Mueller. “There’s no intention or plan to make any changes in regards to the special counsel,” Ms. Sanders said.The two also played down the possibility that Mr. Trump might pardon Mr. Manafort or others caught in the special counsel’s investigation. “I haven’t had a conversation with the president about pardons or pardoning individuals,” said Mr. Sekulow. Ms. Sanders likewise said that she had not spoken with the president about the possibility of pardons.The president’s team again pointed to the Democrats to argue that they were the ones who were collaborating with Russia because of a salacious dossier of allegations against Mr. Trump produced by a firm called Fusion GPS that was paid in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign.“The real collusion scandal as we’ve said several times before has everything to do with the Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS and Russia,” Ms. Sanders said. “There’s clear evidence of the Clinton campaign colluding with Russian intelligence to spread disinformation and smear the president to influence the election.”', 'President asks why Democrats aren\'t the focus, adds that there is \'no collusion\'President Trump fired back on Monday in an attempt to distance his White House from the grand jury indictments of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an aide, noting their crimes were committed “years” before they worked on the campaign.The president led a chorus of critics of the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, noting that the crimes for which Manafort and his aide, Rick Gates, are charged appear to predate the presidential campaign by years.“Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????” Trump tweeted Monday. “….Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”Manafort and Gates were indicted by a federal grand jury Friday on 12 counts, including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading Foreign Agent Registration (FARA) statements, false statements and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign banks and financial accounts. The indictments were announced Monday.Mueller’s team also unsealed a guilty plea by former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who admitted to making false statements to FBI agents as part of the investigation. According to court documents, Papadopoulos’ false statements were in regards to his relationship with a Russian ‘professor,’ who had ties to Russian government officials.The special counsel probe and Russia “hoax,” as the president has described it, has cast a cloud over the Trump administration. But last week, the White House enjoyed a shift in focus, amid new revelations in the controversial Obama-era Uranium One deal and the payments behind the salacious anti-Trump dossier.Reports last week revealed that Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid more than $9 million to law firm Perkins Coie, which commissioned Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research that ultimately led to the now-infamous dossier.Over the weekend, it was revealed that the conservative Washington Free Beacon website initially funded the opposition research into then-candidate Donald Trump and other GOP contenders for the White House. Lawyers for the Free Beacon told the House Intelligence Committee that the website funded the research between fall 2015 and spring 2016.TRUMP TWEETS ON REPORTS THAT OBAMA CAMPAIGN PAID LAW FIRM THAT HIRED FUSION GPSBut some Republicans say that the Manafort-Gates indictments provide “no evidence” in the Russian collusion narrative.Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., who has repeatedly called for Mueller’s resignation, over the special counsel’s relationship with former FBI Director James Comey, said the indictment “doesn’t have anything to do with Donald Trump.”“I believe that Mr. Mueller’s conflict of interest is absolutely incontrovertible, and I think this is further indication he’s headed in this direction no matter what,” Franks said on his local radio station, KTAR-FM Morning News, Monday. “It’s ironic because ostensibly his investigation is supposed to be into Donald Trump’s potential involvement with Russia, yet this doesn’t have anything to do with Donald Trump.”MUELLER FACING NEW REPUBLICAN PRESSURE TO RESIGN IN RUSSIA PROBEFranks added: “They may try to parlay it into something to hook President Trump in, but right now, this is par for the course. I should suggest this was kind of predictable.”Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y., who is a member of the House Intelligence Committee, which is leading its own Russia probe, echoed a similar sentiment.“This pre-dates the campaign entirely, and could pre-date Paul Manafort even meeting Donald Trump. This has nothing to do with the campaign,” King told Fox News on “America’s Newsroom” Monday. “The investigation still has to go forward but what I’ve seen so far, is there is no evidence at all linking the Trump campaign to Russian influence or collusion.”The Senate Intelligence Committee is also leading a bipartisan Russia probe, and said that the indictment "doesn\'t change" their investigation."The special counsel has found a reason on criminal violations to indict two individuals and I will leave that up to the special counsel to make that determination. It doesn\'t change anything with our investigation," Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C. said in a statement to Fox News. "We received documents from and had interest in two of the individuals named, but clearly the criminal charges put them in the Special Counsel\'s purview."But Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee said that the indictments are “significant” and a “sobering step” in the special counsel’s investigation.“That’s why it is imperative that Congress take action now to protect the independence of the Special Counsel, wherever, or however high his investigation may lead,” Warner said in a statement Monday. “Members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, must also make clear to the President that issuing pardons to any of his associates or to himself would be unacceptable and result in immediate, bipartisan action by Congress.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also said that the president “must not, under any circumstances, interfere” with Mueller’s work.“If he does so, Congress must respond swiftly, unequivocally, and in a bipartisan way to ensure that the investigation continues,” Schumer said in a statement Monday.While Trump has not suggested any plans to interfere with the special counsel investigation, there are currently two pieces of legislation in the Senate, with bipartisan sponsorship, that would ensure a judicial check on the executive branch’s ability to remove a special counsel. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., are behind the bills, along with Democratic senators."The president is not firing the special counsel," Trump\'s attorney, Jay Sekulow, said on CNN Monday.White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also said Monday the president has "no intention or plan to make any changes in regard to Special Counsel."Though some argue the indictments are irrelevant to the Trump-Russia collusion narrative, former top-ranking Justice Department official under both Bush and Obama administrations, James Trusty, told Fox News that this is what happens during a broad investigation.Last week, Mueller expanded his probe to investigate Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta’s dealings with Manafort and a Ukrainian nonprofit. The Podesta Group told Fox News last week they were “cooperating” with the special counsel’s office.Trusty said last week that Mueller has “a lot of room to legitimately poke around and find information on one party or another.”“It’s a cliché, but a good cliché –prosecutors go where the evidence leads them,” Trusty told Fox News last week. “When you define the mission broadly, there is a lot of room for [an independent prosecutor’s] exploration.”Trusty said that if a special counsel’s mission is defined broadly, “it is all fair game if the independent prosecutor is doing his job the right way.”Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

WASHINGTON -- Melania Trump and son Barron joined in a time-honored tradition of receiving the official White House Christmas tree, which will become the showstopper for a president who has vowed to put Christmas back at the center of the winter holidays.A military quartet played holiday tunes Monday as a horse-drawn wagon carried the 19 1/2-foot (5.9-meter) Balsam fir from Wisconsin up the White House driveway.The first lady, wearing a red turtleneck and a coat draped over her shoulders, and 11-year-old Barron, in a dark suit coat, white shirt and dark slacks, circled the tree and then visited with growers Jim and Diane Chapman. The Chapmans own a Wisconsin Christmas tree farm and won an annual contest sponsored by the National Christmas Tree Association."This is a beautiful tree. Thank you so much. We will decorate it very nicely," the first lady told the Chapmans and other family members. "I hope you can come and visit with us."The White House grounds superintendent and the chief usher, who oversees the residence, picked out the tree during a September scouting trip.After Mrs. Trump and Barron gave their symbolic approval, the tree was carefully carted off to the Blue Room where, after a slight trim and the removal of a monstrous chandelier, it will take center stage.President Donald Trump has been eagerly waiting to celebrate a Trump Christmas at the White House. During last year\'s presidential campaign, he railed against the habit of saying "Happy holidays" instead of "Merry Christmas," characterizing it as a "chipping away at Christianity.""And we\'re not going to let that happen anymore, folks. I\'ll tell you," the then-candidate said at a March 2016 news conference in Florida. "A lot of times I\'ll say at the rallies around Christmastime we\'re going to start saying Merry Christmas again. You know, they don\'t say it anymore. The department stores don\'t put it up. We\'re going to start saying it again."Invitations to dozens of holiday parties hosted by the Trumps are going out. The subject line of one emailed invite references a White House "Christmas reception" while the language of the invitation itself refers to a "holiday reception."The tree for the Blue Room usually arrives the day after Thanksgiving, but it was delivered early this year to accommodate the Trumps, who are spending the holiday at their Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.While the Trumps are away, a small army of volunteer decorators and florists from around the country will descend on the White House on Friday and spend the holiday weekend transforming the 132-room mansion for Christmas, complete with a tree in every public room.The White House kitchens will go into overdrive preparing all the food and cakes, cookies and pies that are typically served at the parties, along with the gingerbread White House -- which, for health reasons, is never eaten. In recent years, cookies in the image of former President Barack Obama\'s dogs Bo and Sunny were always among the first items to be slipped into purses for the trip home.Trump does not have a pet.The White House plans to unveil the holiday decor on Monday, and the first lady will also welcome children and students from Joint Base Andrews for a holiday arts and crafts event. The president plans to light the National Christmas Tree on the Ellipse on Thursday.', 'Trump and Corker Escalate Battle Over Taxes, in Personal Terms - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump renewed his attacks on Senator Bob Corker on Tuesday, chastising him for his skepticism over a $1.5 trillion tax cut. Mr. Corker responded by going on national television to say that Mr. Trump was “debasing” the United States and that the president struggled with the truth.Mr. Corker “couldn’t get elected dogcatcher in Tennessee,” Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post on Tuesday. Mr. Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, is not running for re-election after serving in the Senate since 2007.Mr. Corker returned fire with a theme he has hit before, when he referred to the White House as “an adult day care center.”The extraordinary back and forth between a Republican president and the Republican chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee came just hours before Mr. Trump is to join Senate Republicans for their weekly lunch in the Capitol. That lunch is expected to be dominated by a discussion of the ambitious tax package set to be released as soon as next week.Republicans are attempting to craft a tax bill that can pass the Senate by a party-line vote, avoiding a Democratic filibuster.To do that, they must contain the revenue losses from reducing tax rates, both over the next decade and in the years to follow.The party’s most difficult fights will be over how to do that — by some combination of eliminating popular tax breaks and employing accounting maneuvers, such as setting some tax cuts to expire, in order to reduce revenue losses.Mr. Corker stands as a possible impediment to that plan. A longstanding opponent of rising federal deficits, the senator has said he will not vote for any tax bill that would increase the federal debt by a dollar. But on Thursday, the House is expected to give final approval to a budget blueprint that would protect a 10-year, $1.5 trillion tax measure from a Democratic filibuster.A Treasury Department report released on Friday showed that the budget deficit for fiscal 2017 grew by $80 billion, to $666 billion, as federal spending eclipsed revenues and economic growth remained tepid. At the same time, Congress is contemplating what the president has promised would be the largest tax cut in history.The protracted Tuesday-morning brawl quickly spread from taxes and debt to foreign policy and the president’s fitness for office.Mr. Corker said Mr. Trump was “absolutely not” a role model for the children in America.“I don’t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and debases our country,” Mr. Corker said in a CNN interview, suggesting that he will soon convene hearings to examine the ways Mr. Trump “purposely has been breaking down relationships around the world.”“It’s unfortunate that our nation finds itself in this place,” he added.Mr. Trump then attacked Mr. Corker’s tenure at the helm of the Foreign Relations Committee.Mr. Corker, who supported Mr. Trump in the 2016 presidential election, told CNN on Tuesday that he would not do that again.Mr. Trump and Mr. Corker have been locked in a public feud for weeks. Mr. Corker has said that Mr. Trump runs his White House like a reality TV show, and Mr. Trump has responded by mocking Mr. Corker’s height, calling him “Liddle’ Bob.”Mr. Trump has made declarations about the tax plan while the legislation is still being drafted. On Monday, Mr. Trump said the plan would not include any changes to how much Americans can save in tax-deferred retirement plans like 401(k) accounts.“Hopefully the White House will step aside and let that occur in a normal process,” Mr. Corker said on NBC’s “Today.”Any tax plan would need all the Republican support Mr. Trump can get in the Senate, and his fight with Mr. Corker puts that support in jeopardy.“I think it’s fine for him to come over,” Mr. Corker said of the president’s visit to Capitol Hill. “I do look at these things as more of a photo op. They’re not really about substance, but more power to him.”The Republicans have promised the most sweeping revision of the tax code in decades, a challenging task that has already met Democratic opposition. Some supporters of the tax overhaul are concerned Mr. Trump’s streaming comments on the plan could hurt chances of getting it approved.', 'Odds Are, Russia Owns Trump - The New York TimesThree months ago, The Washington Post reported that even as Donald Trump ran for president, he pursued plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. The next day, The New York Times published excerpts from emails between Felix Sater, a felon with ties to Russian organized crime, and Michael Cohen, one of Donald Trump’s lawyers and Sater’s childhood friend, about the project. Sater was apparently an intermediary between Trump and Russia, and in a Nov. 3, 2015, email to Cohen, he made the strange argument that a successful deal would lead to Trump’s becoming president. Boasting that he was close enough to Vladimir Putin to let Ivanka Trump sit in the Russian president’s desk chair, Sater wrote, “I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected.”These stories were, at the time, bombshells. At a minimum, they showed that Trump was lying when he said, repeatedly, that he had “nothing to do with Russia.” Further, Sater’s logic — that Putin’s buy-in on a real estate deal would result in Trump’s election — was bizarre, suggesting that some part of the proposed collaboration was left unsaid.But three months feels like three decades in Trump years, and I mostly forgot about these reports until I read Luke Harding’s new book, “Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win.” One uncanny aspect of the investigations into Trump’s Russia connections is that instead of too little evidence there’s too much. It’s impossible to keep it straight without the kind of chaotic wall charts that Carrie Mathison of “Homeland” assembled during her manic episodes. Incidents that would be major scandals in a normal administration — like the mere fact of Trump’s connection to Sater — become minor subplots in this one.That’s why “Collusion” is so essential, and why I wish everyone who is skeptical that Russia has leverage over Trump would read it. This country — at least the parts not wholly under the sway of right-wing propaganda — needs to come to terms with substantial evidence that the president is in thrall to a foreign power.Harding, the former Moscow bureau chief of The Guardian, has been reporting on shady characters like Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who was indicted last month, long before Trump announced his candidacy. He was able to interview Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier attempting to detail Trump’s relationship with the Kremlin, and who describes the conspiracy between the American president and the Russians as “massive — absolutely massive.”“Collusion” doesn’t purport to solve all the mysteries of this alleged conspiracy. There’s no longer any serious question that there was cooperation between Trump’s campaign and Russia, but the extent of the cooperation, and the precise nature of it, remains opaque. Harding makes a strong case for Steele’s credibility, but Steele reportedly said that the raw intelligence in his dossier is only 70 percent to 90 percent accurate, so it’s hard to know which parts of it to believe.But Harding’s book is invaluable in collating the overwhelming evidence of a web of relationships between the Kremlin, Trump and members of Trump’s circle. He suggests, convincingly, that Russia may have been cultivating Trump since the 1980s. At that time, Harding writes, the K.G.B. was working to draw “prominent figures in the West” — as the K.G.B. described them — into collaboration. According to Harding, a form for evaluating targets asked, “Are pride, arrogance, egoism, ambition or vanity among subject’s natural characteristics?”Last week, The Times reported that many Russian critics of Putin deplore America’s fixation on Moscow’s role in the election, since it reinforces Putin’s image of himself as an “ever-victorious master strategist” controlling world affairs. The article quoted Ivan Kurilla, a Russian historian and America expert: “American liberals are so upset about Trump that they cannot believe he is a real product of American life. They try to portray him as something created by Russia.”As one of those American liberals, I don’t think this is quite right. Trump, the gaudy huckster who treats closing a sale as the height of human endeavor, is a quintessentially American figure. His campaign of racial and religious grievance drew on the darkest currents of American history. At most, Putin appears to have recognized an opportunity that American political dysfunction created.It’s a sign of how deep that dysfunction goes that the substantial evidence that the president is not a patriot hasn’t caused more of a political earthquake. America, stunned and divided, appears incapable of metabolizing all we’re learning about the man in the White House. Yes, we have investigations, but the business of government plods on; right now the Senate is working on the Roy Moore of tax bills, a piece of legislation that magnifies right-wing pathologies into a cartoonish grotesque.It wasn’t Putin who fashioned a Republican Party willing to tolerate something close to treason if it’s the price of corporate tax cuts. Even if all the Republicans in Congress read Harding’s book, they probably wouldn’t act. But at least they’d know what they’re abetting.', '', 'Political panel reacts Democratic Rep.

Yet Mr. Trump is leaving his two most senior economic advisers back home, as well as the White House economist whose anti-China views inform much of Mr. Trump’s thinking on the subject.He is also not taking his daughter Ivanka, who accompanied him to a summit meeting in Germany in July and raised eyebrows after she took his empty seat during a session with other world leaders. Her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser who once laid claim to the China portfolio, will return to Washington after the president’s stop in Beijing.The staffing of any major presidential trip is an exercise in internal politics — sometimes byzantine — as the White House parcels out coveted seats on Air Force One. But the Trump administration’s staffing of this trip is drawing particular scrutiny from those seeking clues about who’s up or down, and what message the president is trying to send to allies and adversaries.In some cases, the administration’s staffing decisions have been driven by straightforward domestic politics. White House officials said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, both needed to stay in Washington to lobby Congress for Mr. Trump’s proposed overhaul of the tax code.Ivanka Trump, too, is being enlisted in the tax overhaul campaign, these officials said, after she surprised officials by proving effective at lobbying for her pet issue, an expanded tax credit for children.But leaving Ms. Trump off the trip also removes an unwelcome spotlight from her clothing line, which is manufactured in Chinese factories under conditions that activists say fall short of the message of women’s empowerment that she has been preaching, most recently in Tokyo on Friday (she returned to Washington before Mr. Trump arrived).Mr. Kushner’s role on China has been similarly circumscribed in recent months. He was pivotal in arranging the first face-to-face meeting between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s Florida estate, in April, which he did through a back channel with China’s ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai.But Mr. Kushner has taken a lower profile on China since then, in part, officials said, because of concerns about his efforts to lure Chinese investors into his family’s real estate ventures in New York City, as well as his sister’s campaign to attract Chinese money through a visa program that offers American citizenship to foreign investors.The administration’s decision to leave the economist Peter Navarro off the plane appears to be more about symbolism than protocol.As director of the White House National Trade Council, Mr. Navarro would not automatically be guaranteed a place on a presidential delegation to Asia. But more than any other White House official, Mr. Navarro is identified with an anti-China stance on trade. His strident writings on the American trade relationship with Beijing — one of his books is titled “Death by China” — won him Mr. Trump’s notice and a job in the administration.Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist and an ally of Mr. Navarro’s, lobbied to get him a seat on the plane. Leaving Mr. Navarro at home, he has told colleagues, undercuts the president’s talk of confronting China with a tough message on trade.That may be precisely the point. Mr. Navarro now reports to Mr. Cohn, after a reshuffle engineered by Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, John F. Kelly. Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, has argued against the most aggressive protectionist moves advocated by Mr. Bannon and Mr. Navarro.While the White House has talked about pressing China and other Asian countries on trade, it is not asking the Chinese for any major steps during this trip. Administration officials said the White House wanted to avoid accepting incremental measures when it is seeking a more wholesale change in the trade relationship.Some former officials were disappointed, saying Mr. Trump was squandering an opportunity to use a presidential visit to extract meaningful measures from the Chinese. The president is bringing 29 corporate chief executives to Beijing, and the White House seemed content to roll out a list of billion-dollar deals for American industry.“If that’s the policy decision, it seems like a missed opportunity,” said Daniel M. Price, who served as President George W. Bush’s economic “sherpa” at summit meetings. “I can’t recall a presidential visit that did not couple the announcement of deals with the securing of additional market access reforms.”Cutting contentious figures, however, has a long history at the White House. Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter’s national security adviser, once excluded the diplomat Richard C. Holbrooke from a meeting with China’s paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, because Mr. Brzezinski feared Mr. Holbrooke’s forceful style would upset him.Mr. Trump is bringing his commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, and the United States trade representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, on the trip. But Mr. Ross will be present only for the Beijing stop, officials said, and his history with China trade issues is more ambiguous.While Mr. Ross has pushed for the United States to take a tough line on steel imports by countries from South Korea to Mexico to Germany, he tried to cut a deal with China last summer, under which the Chinese would voluntarily reduce their capacity in steel production. When Mr. Ross presented the agreement to Mr. Trump, he angrily vetoed it, saying he wanted to impose tariffs on countries that export steel to the United States.Mr. Trump will, however, be backed by a full complement of national security advisers. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson will accompany the president on every stop, as will the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster.To some analysts, that suggests the White House will make a much stronger argument on mustering regional pressure on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs than on overhauling the trade relationships between Asia and the United States.', '', "Conor Powell reporter from IsraelJERUSALEM – Palestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II.

Inflation remains high while job opportunities stay low.They also said Trump\'s threats fall in line with what Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic Revolution have warned: Americans can\'t be trusted. That feeling has unified hard-liners supporting Iran\'s clerically overseen government, as well as reformists seeking to change it."I have not seen any benefit from the deal, so what is Trump going to add to nothing?" asked Gholamreza Haeri, a 21-year-old architecture student. "Is he going to add zero to zero?"The faith of the average Iranian has eroded over time in the nuclear deal, which saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. It was sealed in July 2015 after 18 months of negotiations by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — the U.S., Britain, China, France and Russia — as well as Germany.In September 2015, a telephone survey by the Toronto-based opinion research firm IranPoll for the University of Maryland found 45 percent of 1,000 Iranians said they were not confident the U.S. would live up to its obligations in the nuclear deal. By September 2017, an IranPoll telephone survey of 700 urban Iranians found 77 percent were not confident. The margins of error for the polls were 3.1 percentage points and 3.7 percentage points respectively."The trend has continuously been increasing," said Amir Farmanesh, the president and CEO of IranPoll.That suspicion extended to Tehran\'s streets Monday. Bahram Safari, a 39-year-old junior high school teacher, said he initially supported the nuclear deal but slowly became disenchanted by Trump\'s constant attacks. Safari pointed to comments by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who repeatedly called the Americans untrustworthy during the negotiations."During the nuclear talks, I was wondering why the supreme leader was saying so, now I understand that he was right," Safari said. "Americans are not loyal to their signatures."Ashkan Ashtari, a 30-year-old electronics importer, said breaching the deal will be problematic for both sides."Iranians are worried about a breach of the nuclear deal because Iran has kept with all of its commitments and has been loyal to the agreement," he said. "Chances are that the U.S. president will break his country\'s commitment, as he has done so before."For Iranians, they still do not have access to international credit cards. While Iranian banks have reconnected to the SWIFT network, which allows for international wire transfers, many complain they still don\'t have access to global financial markets."I know that under the deal, Western banks were supposed to enter Iranian market, but they have not come in practice," said 31-year-old Zohreh Lavasani, who works at a private bank. "So I do not expect the new move by Trump can lead to a meaningful change."Iran\'s stock market dropped 1.2 percent in the last week as the price of hard currencies like dollars and euros edged up against the Iranian rial.Mehdi Abedi, a 30-year-old tire dealer, said despite the challenges, Iran could handle facing more U.S. sanctions."The world community is not just America. Iran can still continue its dealings with other countries," he said. "We have been at odds with the United States for about 40 years now and have managed to survive despite conflicts."Also on Monday, Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the top commander of the Revolutionary Guard, said in a statement that Iranian officials will have a "unified" approach toward the U.S. threats, the official IRNA news agency reported."Rest assured Mr. Trump that we (the Guard), foreign ministry and administration are united and our hearts are synchronized," the report quoted Jafari as saying.Some people continue to hold out hope for the nuclear deal. On Sunday, the German Embassy in Tehran put a placard on its wall saying: "Yes to Barjam" — nuclear deal in Farsi. Germany was involved in negotiating the agreement."I still want the deal to remain in place and both sides remain faithful to it so that we can finally see its positive impact on the lives of the people," said Hassan Aghaei, a 23-year-old street food vendor.But some saw fault in both sides."Iran\'s actions have probably provoked America, such as testing missiles and similar things," said Mehdi Shakeri, 42, who imports and sells car parts. "Iran could have dealt with Trump more cautiously because he is a radical leader and many of his actions are not always based on logic. Perhaps if Iran had not made Trump sensitive toward itself, we would not be in the situation we are today."___Associated Press writers Mohammad Nasiri in Tehran and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed.', 'The Trump Dossier: What We Know and Who Paid for It - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — The so-called Steele dossier of research into President Trump’s connections to Russia is back in the news, with the revelation that it was at least partly funded by Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee.It is a 35-page collection of research memos written by Christopher Steele, a respected former British intelligence agent, primarily during the 2016 presidential campaign. The memos allege a multifaceted conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to help Mr. Trump defeat Mrs. Clinton. The memos also detail unsubstantiated accounts of encounters between Mr. Trump and Russian prostitutes, and real estate deals that were intended as bribes, among other claims about Mr. Trump’s businesses.During the Republican primaries, a donor opposed to Mr. Trump becoming the party’s presidential candidate retained a research firm called Fusion GPS to unearth potentially damaging information about Mr. Trump. The donor has never been identified, but several possible suspects have denied responsibility, including officials from the so-called super PACs that supported the rival campaigns of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.After Mr. Trump secured the nomination, Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and the D.N.C. by their law firm, Perkins Coie, to compile research about Mr. Trump, his businesses and associates — including possible connections with Russia. It was at that point that Fusion GPS hired Mr. Steele, who has deep sourcing in Russia, to gather information.That depends on your politics.Republicans have criticized the dossier since it was first publicly disseminated when Buzzfeed published it in January. Mr. Trump has blasted it as “fake news” and “phony stuff,” and alleged that it is part of a broader witch hunt intended to cast doubt on his victory. His allies now contend that the allegations in the dossier are discredited by the fact that it was funded at least partially by the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. Mr. Trump asserted on Wednesday in an interview with Fox Business Network’s “Lou Dobbs Tonight” that the Democrats’ payments for the research were “the real collusion.”Democrats argue that who paid for the research is irrelevant to the veracity of its claims, which they say should be thoroughly investigated. Yet some of the Democrats who funded the dossier have been leery about being associated with it. The lead Perkins Coie lawyer representing both the campaign and the D.N.C., Marc Elias, pushed back earlier this year when asked whether his firm was the client for the dossier, whether he possessed it before the election and whether he was involved in efforts to encourage media outlets to write about its contents.On Tuesday, the veteran Democratic consultant Anita Dunn, who is working with Perkins Coie, explained Mr. Elias’s earlier response. “Obviously, he was not at liberty to confirm Perkins Coie as the client at that point, and should perhaps have ‘no commented’ more artfully,” Ms. Dunn wrote in an email.Campaigns and party committees frequently pay companies to assemble what’s known in politics as opposition research — essentially damaging information about their opponents — and nothing is illegal about the practice.However, Republicans and campaign watchdogs have accused the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. of violating campaign finance laws by disguising the payments to Fusion GPS on mandatory disclosures to the Federal Election Commission. Their disclosure reports do not list any payments from the Clinton campaign or the D.N.C. to Fusion GPS. They do list a total of $12.4 million in payments to Perkins Coie, but that’s almost entirely for legal consulting, with only one payment — of $66,500 — for “research consulting” from the D.N.C.In a complaint filed with the F.E.C. on Wednesday, the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit group that urges stricter enforcement of election laws, alleged that “at least some of those payments were earmarked for Fusion GPS, with the purpose of conducting opposition research on Donald Trump.” The complaint asserts that the failure to list the ultimate purpose of that money “undermined the vital public information role that reporting is intended to serve.”Graham M. Wilson, a partner at Perkins Coie, called the complaint “patently baseless,” in part because, he said, the research was done “to support the provision of legal services, and payments made by vendors to sub-vendors are not required to be disclosed in circumstances like this.”Officials from the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. have said they were unaware that Perkins Coie facilitated the research on their behalf, even though the law firm was using their money to pay for it. Even Mrs. Clinton only found about Mr. Steele’s research after Buzzfeed published the dossier, according to two associates who discussed the matter with her. They said that she was disappointed that the research — as well as the fact that the F.B.I. was looking into connections between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia — was not made public before Election Day.But word of the memos and their contents had circulated in Washington political and media circles before the election. In British court filings, Mr. Steele’s lawyers said that he and Fusion GPS briefed journalists from a range of media outlets, including The New York Times, on his research starting in September of 2016.Yet the research and even the existence of the dossier were not reported by the media, with the exception of Mother Jones magazine, which published a story in the days before the election that described the dossier, its origin and significance, while omitting the salacious claims.There has been no public corroboration of the salacious allegations against Mr. Trump, nor of the specific claims about coordination between his associates and the Russians. In fact, some of those claims have been challenged with supporting evidence. For instance, Mr. Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, produced his passport to rebut the dossier’s claim that he had secret meetings in Prague with a Russian official last year.James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director whose firing by Mr. Trump prompted the appointment of a special counsel to oversee the Justice Department’s Russia investigation, received a copy of the memos after Election Day from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Mr. McCain had dispatched David J. Kramer, a former top State Department official, to obtain the dossier directly from Mr. Steele. And before Election Day, the F.B.I. reached an agreement to pay Mr. Steele to continue his research, though that plan was scrapped after the dossier was published. During the presidential transition, senior American intelligence officials briefed Mr. Trump and President Barack Obama on the dossier.Investigators from the House and Senate intelligence committees and Mr. Mueller’s team have been exploring claims made in the dossier. Mr. Mueller’s team reportedly interviewed Mr. Steele over the summer.', '', '', '', '', 'Why Roy Moore and Not Trump? - The New York Times', "Former NBC host Billy Bush pens an op-ed in 'The New York Times' criticizing Donald Trump for questioning the legitimacy of the Access Hollywood footage where the then-Apprentice host bragged about sexually assaulting women.Former “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush slammed President Donald Trump on Sunday after the president reportedly questioned the authenticity of the tape where he is heard bragging about grabbing women.“Of course he said it,” Bush wrote in the article for The New York Times on Sunday, confirming that Trump said the infamous “grab them by the p----” comment in the “Access Hollywood” tape that resurfaced during the election last year.The article follows reports that Trump privately questioned whether the infamous tape with his vulgar remarks is authentic. “We don’t think that was my voice,” Trump told an unnamed Republican senator back in January, The Times reported.The president reportedly continued repeating the claim to others in private since. In recent days, amid sexual harassment allegations rocking Washington, he reportedly reiterated that it was not his voice on the tape.Bush, the nephew of former President George H.W. Bush, was fired from NBC's “Today” show after the tape was released last year and is scheduled to speak with late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert on Monday. He has said seven people heard Trump’s crude comments and that denying the veracity of the tape is “indulging in some revisionist history.”“We laughed along, without a single doubt that this was hypothetical hot air from America’s highest-rated bloviator,” he added. “Along with Donald Trump and me, there were seven other guys present on the bus at the time, and every single one of us assumed we were listening to a crass standup act. He was performing. Surely, we thought, none of this was real.”In October 2016, just hours after the tape was released, Trump admitted it was his voice and apologized for making the crude remarks involving women. “I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,” he said in response to the tape.Lukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Luther Strange in a GOP primary runoff that pitted President Donald Trump against some of his most loyal supporters, including former chief strategist Steve Bannon, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and a slew of conservative members of the House of Representatives.With 57 percent of the precincts reporting, Moore led Strange by 57 percent to 43 percent, a margin of more than 35,000 votes. State officials estimated a low turnout of between 12 and 15 percent of eligible voters.Strange lost despite the endorsement of Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, both of whom traveled to Alabama to make the case for the incumbent in the final week of the race.In his concession statement, Strange thanked Trump and Pence for their support and vowed to "go back to work with President Trump and do all I can to advance his agenda over the next few weeks."Moore is now the favorite in December\'s general election against Democrat Doug Jones, a lawyer and former U.S. attorney during President Bill Clinton\'s administration. The winner of that race will complete the Senate term started by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and be up for re-election in 2020.At a rally in Huntsville Friday, Trump portrayed Strange as loyal to him and said he appreciated how Strange agreed to vote for ObamaCare replacement legislation this summer without asking any favors from him. However, Trump’s endorsement was overshadowed nationally by his attack on NFL players who kneel during the National Anthem prior to games. Trump also said at the Alabama rally that he would campaign for Moore in the general election if he secured the nomination, but he believed Moore would have a tougher time against Jones in the general election.Trump posted a Tweet before voting began Tuesday morning, imploring Alabamians to "Finish the job [and] vote for \'Big Luther.\'"Pence also flew to Birmingham on Monday evening to campaign for Strange."Luther Strange is a real conservative. He\'s a leader and a real friend to President Trump. I got to tell you, Big Luther has been making a big difference in Washington," Pence said before exiting the stage to the tune of "Sweet Home Alabama."The Senate Leadership Fund, a group with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., spent an estimated $9 million trying to secure the nomination for Strange. That support played into Moore\'s argument that the election was an opportunity to send a lesson to what he called the "elite Washington establishment." "Mitch McConnell needs to be replaced and your vote tomorrow may determine that," Moore said Monday at a Fairhope rally attended by Bannon, Brexit leader Nigel Farage, and "Duck Dynasty" star Phil Robertson.Bannon told the crowd that Alabama can show the world "that this populist, nationalist, conservative movement is on the rise.""A vote for Roy Moore is a vote for Donald J. Trump," Bannon said.Wearing a white cowboy hat and leather vest at the rally Monday night, Moore repeated the conservative Christian themes he has used his entire public career. He also lashed out at attack ads run against him in the race, including one suggesting he was weak on gun rights. "I believe in the Second Amendment," Moore said, pulling a handgun from his pocket.Moore, known in Alabama as the "Ten Commandments Judge," has a colorful political history that has both fueled and complicated his rise.Moore first received national attention in the 1990s as a county judge when he hung a wooden Ten Commandments plaque on the wall of his courtroom. The ACLU filed a lawsuit against him.Benefiting from his popularity after the episode, Moore then ran and won a race for chief justice of the state’s Supreme Court in 2000. But he was ousted after refusing to remove a 5,280-pound granite Ten Commandments monument from the rotunda of the state judicial building.Moore resurrected his political career in 2012, when he was elected chief justice again. But his second tenure was short-lived: in 2016, Moore was suspended as chief justice after he directed probate judges not to issue marriage certificates to gay couples.Strange, the former attorney general in Alabama, was temporarily appointed to the seat in April by then-Gov. Robert Bentley, who has since resigned in disgrace. Opponents have used the appointment against Strange, accusing Bentley of naming him to the seat so he could install someone who might be more sympathetic to him in the state attorney general’s office.On the outskirts of Montgomery, 76-year-old Air Force retiree John Lauer said Trump\'s endorsement swayed him to vote for Strange on Tuesday."I voted for Strange. I\'m a Trump voter. Either one is going to basically do the Trump agenda, but since Trump came out for Luther, I voted for Luther," said Lauer said.Merlene Bohannon, a widow with three grown children, said she had planned to vote for Strange until seeing Bannon stump for Moore on Fox News on Monday night."Steve Bannon and God spoke to me, and this morning when I went in I voted for Moore," said Bohannon, 74.Fox News\' Alex Pappas and the Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'WASHINGTON – The U.S. ramped up its response Monday to the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico, even as President Donald Trump brought up the island\'s struggles before Hurricane Maria struck — including "billions of dollars" in debt to "Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with."The Trump administration has tried to blunt criticism that its response to Hurricane Maria has fallen short of its efforts in Texas and Florida after the recent hurricanes there.Five days after the Category 4 storm slammed into Puerto Rico, many of the more than 3.4 million U.S. citizens in the territory were still without adequate food, water and fuel. Flights off the island were infrequent, communications were spotty and roads were clogged with debris. Officials said electrical power may not be fully restored for more than a month.The president said Tuesday that he plans to visit Puerto Rico next week, the earliest he said he can go without disrupting recovery operations.Trump pointed out some differences between the two states and the island in a series of tweets Monday night."Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble."Trump also noted that the island\'s electrical grid was already "in terrible shape." Still, he promised, "Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well."In Washington, officials said no armada of U.S. Navy ships was headed to the island because supplies could be carried in more efficiently by plane. The Trump administration ruled out temporarily setting aside federal restrictions on foreign ships\' transportation of cargo, saying it wasn\'t needed. The government had waived those rules in Florida and Texas until last week.Though the administration said the focus on aid was strong, when two Cabinet secretaries spoke at a conference on another subject — including Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whose agency is helping restore the island\'s power — neither made any mention of Puerto Rico or Hurricane Maria.Democratic lawmakers with large Puerto Rican constituencies back on the mainland characterized the response so far as too little and too slow. The confirmed death toll from Maria jumped to at least 49 on Monday, including 16 in Puerto Rico."Puerto Ricans are Americans," said Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., who traveled to Puerto Rico over the weekend to assess the damage. "We cannot and will not turn our backs on them."The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, and White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert landed in San Juan on Monday, appearing with Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello at a news briefing. Though Rossello had urgently called for more emergency assistance over the weekend, he expressed his gratitude for the help so far.The governor said the presence of Long and Bossert was "a clear indication that the administration is committed with Puerto Rico\'s recovery process."Long said, "We\'ve got a lot of work to do. We realize that."Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke made no mention of Puerto Rico or the hurricane during a joint appearance before the National Petroleum Council, a business-friendly federal advisory committee. News reporters were not allowed to ask questions.Perry had traveled with Trump to Texas and Florida following hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Energy Department crews are working in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, coordinating with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, FEMA and a team from the New York Power Authority, among others. An eight-member team from the Western Area Power Authority, an Energy Department agency, assisted with initial damage assessments in Puerto Rico and has been redeployed to St. Thomas. A spokeswoman said additional responders would go to Puerto Rico as soon as transportation to the hurricane-ravaged island could be arranged.Zinke\'s department oversees the U.S. Virgin Islands, along with other territories.The federal response to Maria faces obvious logistical challenges beyond those in Texas or Florida. Supplies must be delivered by air or sea, rather than with convoys of trucks.FEMA said it had more than 700 staff on the ground in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They were helping coordinate a federal response that now includes more than 10,000 federal personnel spread across the two Caribbean archipelagos.In Puerto Rico, federal workers supplied diesel to fuel generators at hospitals and delivered desperately needed food and water to hard-hit communities across the island. Cargo flights are bringing in additional supplies, and barges loaded with more goods are starting to arrive in the island\'s ports.San Juan\'s international airport handled nearly 100 arrivals and departures on Sunday, including military and relief operations, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The Pentagon dispatched the Navy amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge, which provided helicopters and Marines to help with the relief effort onshore.However, the Trump administration said Monday it would not waive federal restrictions on foreign ships\' transportation of cargo as it had following Harvey and Irma. The administration said it will continue to enforce the Jones Act, which requires that goods transported between U.S. ports be carried on U.S.-flagged ships.Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan said the agency had concluded there were already enough US-flagged vessels available.On Capitol Hill, congressional leaders were talking about how to pay for it all. Puerto Rico was already struggling from steep financial and economic challenges before Maria made landfall.Last year, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi joined with President Barack Obama to help recession-ravaged Puerto Rico deal with its debt crisis. After the devastating storm, Puerto Ricans will now be eligible to benefit from the same pots of federal emergency disaster aid and rebuilding funds available to residents in Texas and Florida.Lawmakers approved a $15 billion hurricane relief packaged after Harvey hit Texas, but billions more will likely now be needed to respond to Maria.Ryan said Monday that Congress will ensure the people of Puerto Rico "have what they need."___Associated Press reporters Ben Fox in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Jill Colvin, Robert Burns, Matthew Daly, Joan Lowy and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed.___Follow Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck', 'WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump challenged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to "compare IQ tests," delivering a sharp-edged ribbing that threw a bright spotlight on his seemingly shaky relationship with his top diplomat. The White House insisted the president was only joking.Trump issued the challenge in an interview with Forbes magazine, when asked about reports that Tillerson had called him a "moron" after a classified briefing this summer. The president responded that if the claim was true, the two should duke it out in a battle of brainpower."And I can tell you who is going to win," Trump said.The White House and the State Department suggested Tuesday that the president was simply trying to make light of what they describe as inaccurate reports of tension between them. But coming amid increasingly public signs of strain between the president and Tillerson, the remark landed with a distinct hint of malice.Trump\'s comments have threatened to undermine Tillerson\'s diplomatic initiatives and sow confusion among allies and foes over whether he speaks for the U.S. and has the support of the White House. That uncertainly could impact a number of foreign policy crises, including the nuclear threat posed by North Korea and the imminent decision to be made as to whether to continue the Iran nuclear pact.Trump on Tuesday declared that he had confidence in Tillerson just hours after the publication of the interview — and before a private luncheon with Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.But people close to Trump say the president has grown increasingly dissatisfied with the former Exxon CEO, whom he views as holding a conventional view of America\'s role in the world and lacking star power. Tillerson, meanwhile, is said to have grown weary of Trump contradicting his public pronouncements and of becoming increasingly isolated in a capital to which he has never warmed.The NBC News report last week claiming Tillerson described Trump as a "moron" — to associates after a highly classified July briefing — brought the simmering frustration between the men into the open.This account is based on conversations with several White House aides, State Department officials and others who spoke with the two men over the past week.Seldom backing down from a fight, Trump escalated another public feud on Tuesday, unloading on \'Liddle Bob Corker," a Republican senator who has dubbed the White House an "adult day care center" and said the president could be setting the nation on the path toward World War III.Other GOP leaders urged the two men to calm a quarrel that could imperil the Republican agenda on Capitol Hill and lawmakers\' election chances next fall.Later Tuesday, Trump took to Twitter in defense of White House chief of staff John Kelly. Trump accused "The Fake News" of trying to hurt Kelly "by saying he will soon be fired.""This story is totally made up by the dishonest media," Trump tweeted. It was unclear which specific news outlets he was referring to.As for Tillerson, Trump had no relationship with him prior to last year\'s election but offered him the secretary of state post after being impressed with his global oil tycoon resume and receiving recommendations from foreign policy heavyweights including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates.But the two men have not clicked, and Tillerson was soon painted by some "America First" forces in the White House as a publicity-shy, slow-moving "globalist" who did not grasp the nationalist platform of Trump\'s campaign. In particular, Trump has been irked by Tillerson\'s advocacy of staying in both the Paris climate deal and the Iran nuclear pact, and has complained to associates that he does not like how Tillerson candidly voices his disapproval to the president in meetings, according to White House officials and outside advisers.Trump empowered his son-in-law, senior adviser Jared Kushner, to spearhead the administration\'s efforts at Middle East peace, stripping the State Department of what is usually a major priority. Trump also grew annoyed with what he perceived as Tillerson\'s go-it-alone approach to diplomacy with North Korea, declaring in a scorching tweet last weekend that the secretary of state was "wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man," Trump\'s nickname for Kim Jong Un.The president was also angry with Tillerson\'s remarks after Trump declared there were "fine people" on both sides of the clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, between white supremacists and anti-racist demonstrators that left one person dead, according to two people familiar with the Trump\'s beliefs but not authorized to discuss private conversations."The president speaks for himself," Tillerson said at the time.The back-and-forth has been eyebrow-raising for foreign diplomats tasked with decoding U.S. foreign policy. While the State Department has assured diplomats there\'s no rift between Trump and Tillerson, the president\'s barbed comments have risked undermining confidence in the direction of Washington\'s foreign policy and given an impression of disunity in the Cabinet, according to three foreign diplomats based in Washington.One specifically cited the confusion created by Trump\'s tweet on Tillerson\'s North Korea diplomacy, saying that if North Korea\'s interlocutors feel Tillerson lacks authority, they may be more hesitant to convey possible U.S. diplomatic overtures to their leadership in Pyongyang.The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Trump denied Tuesday that he was undermining Tillerson. Sitting alongside former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at a White House meeting, Trump told reporters, "No, I didn\'t undercut anybody. I don\'t believe in undercutting people." And White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to laugh off Trump\'s IQ comment."The president certainly never implied that the secretary of state was not incredibly intelligent. He made a joke, no more than that," she said.But Tillerson has at times felt undercut by Trump\'s contradictory messages, including his comments on a crisis with Qatar this summer, according to a person who has spoken with the secretary of state.Tillerson has found other allies in the administration. He and Defense Secretary Mattis took the lead this summer in organizing a highly classified briefing for Trump at the Pentagon at which military, diplomatic and intelligence officials sought to make the case for retaining a robust U.S. presence in Afghanistan and other far-flung locales.It was after that meeting on July 20 that Tillerson is alleged to have referred to Trump as a "moron." Tillerson has dismissed reports of the remark as "petty nonsense" and State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert denied he ever said it.But the meeting resulted in a rare win for Tillerson, as Trump committed to maintaining and slightly growing American forces in Afghanistan.___Lemire reported from New York.

Sign uphere.**  On the roster:A good economy is bad for tax cut chances - Twitter flips, will allow Blackburn pro-life ad - Trump hikes pressure on NAFTA in meeting with Trudeau - House delays vote on kids’ insurance program -**Googles defense attorneys near me**A GOOD ECONOMY IS BAD FOR TAX CUT CHANCES One of the best examples of the perverse incentives of our political duopoly is the way the minority party roots against good economic news.  Politicians and the press tend to fabulously overstate the influence presidents and congresses have on the economic behavior of every rutabaga farmer, dongle dangler, geegaw and gimcrack maker and shoeshine stand proprietor across our fair nation.  If times are good, it’s because your guys did it. If times are bad, it’s because of those other finks.  Short of politically capitalizing on military failures, hoping for bad economic outcomes is among the most sadly dispatriotic parts of our already sad political discourse.  Both parties do it, as even a cursory review of official comments on jobs reports and economic data since the Panic of 2008 would show. There’s an almost gleefulness there that only a politico could summon about people losing jobs, homes and hope.  But Democrats these days are having a hard time talking down the economy. Part of this is because they’re still partly in credit-taking mode from the Obama era, but another part is because the economy has been pretty darned good.  We’ll find out in a month or so whether September’s jobs report – the worst in seven years – was an anomaly owed to the most active hurricane season in almost as many years battering two of the largest state’s economies.  If so, and the trend of the past two years – full employment, rising wages, climbing GDP, high profits, relatively modest inflation and robust markets – continues, what exactly will be the case Republicans make for tax cuts?  President Trumpcan’t stop talking about how good the economy, particularly Wall Street, is doing these days. And for a guy who likes to compare ratings, these are killer numbers.  Trump is looking for credit, and deservedly so, if not entirely for reasons he would like.  Yes, markets and corporate leaders are bullish about his regulatory rollbacks and the hope for tax cuts to come. Anything other than the micro-managerial approach from the previous administration must feel like a relief.  But there has also been the matter of missed negative expectations. We have not started a trade war with China, dropped out of NAFTA, defaulted on federal debts, begun mass deportations or started World War III — all things that Trump’s critics have warned of or that Trump himself has threatened.  If Trump makes good on some of that, as he seems to be preparing to do on NAFTA, he won’t be tweeting his love for Wall Street numbers anymore. Plutocratic populism can only survive in good times.  But presuming that cooler heads continue to prevail and Trump remains in the economic policy posture of a normal Republican president, there’s no looming crisis to disrupt what has been a rosy stretch after a long slog following the panic.  Republicans have been yearning to relive their party’s glory days of the 1980s when Ronald Reagan, with an assist from a divided Congress and a Democrat-appointed Federal Reserve chairman, pulled the nation out of a long, painful economic slide.  Reagan succeeded in not only slashing taxes but also reforming the tax code. He and his cohorts help turn things around in the short term, and they also helped plant the seeds for the next boom of the 1990s.  Republicans today are a little like historical re-enactors: They’re adopting the familiar positions on the battlefield, but they’re not firing live rounds.  Reagan & Co. were only able to do what they did because the economy was in shambles. The previous years had seen an energy crisis, stock market crash, crushing inflation and sustained high unemployment. People were desperate for the change Reagan promised, and Democrats were in a poor position to refuse to let him at least try his methods.  That’s nothing like the political moment of today.  America has some structural economic problems including excessive debt, an aging workforce, young workers who are short on necessary qualifications, a confused and dysfunctional health insurance regime and a lack of job stability for lower-middle-class workers in an era of technological disruption.  But Republicans aren’t narrowly targeting those things and instead are focused on giving big business a huge boost and bumping up the disposable incomes of upper-middle-class households. The idea here is that by goosing GDP up a point or so from 3.1 percent will result improvements for all and that a simpler tax code will deliver benefits for many years to come.  It’s a straightforward conservative economic viewpoint: lower taxes and fewer regulations means more growth and better outcomes for more Americans. But we are already hearing lots of grumbling among Republicans.  Some conservatives say that it’s flat or fair enough. But the real concerns are among moderate members who are worried about jacking up deficits through the roof when the country is already $20 trillion in debt.  Such complaints are much easier to swat away in times of economic crisis. Both Reagan andBarack Obamaknew well the value of using moments of crisis to affect large-scale policy changes.  Without such a crisis and desirous of credit for current economic growth, Trump is left to argue essentially that “The economy is awesome! Let’s make it awesomer!”  And the farther we get into his presidency the less willing Trump will be to preach economic gloom. Republicans want to run in 2018 on tax cuts, but Trump wants to run in 2020 as an economic wiz, whether tax cuts pass or not.THE RULEBOOK: IF THEY DON’T SAY SO THEMSELVES “The plan, like every thing from the same pen, marks a turn of thinking, original, comprehensive, and accurate…” –Alexander HamiltonorJames Madison,Federalist No. 49  TIME OUT: FAT SHAMING America is watching with revulsion as one of Hollywood’s biggest moguls is exposed for his serial abuse of women.

Twitter said that they made the decision after reconsidering the ‘context of the entire message,’ according toa report by Recode. Blackburn said she believes Twitter reversed its decision because ‘the American people rose up.’ ‘I think what has happened, the American people rose up.

State politics are different from national politics. Even if Northam isn’t raking in cash hand over fist, hehas still outraised Gillespie… More than that, gubernatorial elections — especially in Virginia — don’t necessarily reflect the national mood.The best way to see that this race is not necessarily a reliable barometer for the rest of the country is to compare the result in past Virginia gubernatorial elections with the national House vote in the following midterm.”TRUMP HIKES PRESSURE ON NAFTA IN MEETING WITH TRUDEAU Bloomberg:“Canadian Prime MinisterJustin Trudeauplayed up the similarities between President Donald Trump’s policy objectives and his own, saying before a White House meeting Wednesday the two leaders always managed to find common ground.

The fourth round of negotiations in the North American Free Trade Agreement are set to begin Wednesday, assignals mountthe U.S. is putting potentially deal-breaking proposals on the table. Trudeau said he and the president were elected with many of the same goals -- to improve the lot of ordinary citizens who felt economic success had passed them by. ‘We don’t always have the same policy prescriptions to do that, but our desire to help the middle class and those working hard to join it, we always find common ground,’ Trudeau said.”  What he wants -Axios: “The Trump administration will present controversial proposals for NAFTA negotiations… Auto rules of origin:Requiring very high percentages of car parts and materials to be made by the NAFTA countries, and a certain percentage to come from the United States in order for automobile manufacturers to benefit from NAFTA.

Here's what declaring it an emergency will do.Last year more than 64,000 Americans in every corner of our country were lost to drug overdoses. That’s 142 people each day.For too long we have not faced this growing crisis head on. And while we’ve lost so many, we must also remember the innocent children born to addicted parents who are exposed to the dangers of this crisis from their first breath. According to a Center for Disease (CDC) report, the number of babies born addicted to opioids has tripled in the U.S. in 15 years.It won’t be easy, but we can be – and must be – the generation that puts an end to this crisis, and that starts with our politicians in Washington. Take Pennsylvania, for example, where Sen. Pat Toomey has been on the front lines fighting for increased and more responsible funding of programs to combat this epidemic.In 2015, Toomey wrote about his experience traveling the state upon being elected and seeing a pattern emerge. “From Pittsburgh to Philadelphia and across central Pennsylvania, families were being torn apart by a heroin epidemic,” he wrote. “More Pennsylvanians will die this year from overdoses and misuse of heroin and opioid painkillers than from influenza or homicide.”In fact, according to the CDC, three of four new heroin users report abusing opioids before using heroin. In order to stop the cycle of tragedy that Toomey heard about, and that too many people have lived firsthand, we must take action.The approach President Trump outlined in his speech on Thursday that declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency is holistic and addresses not just the effects of addiction, but also the measures to prevent people from becoming addicted in the first place.This process starts with educating our kids about the dangers of addiction. The earlier we educate our communities about addiction and the many forms it can take, the more likely we are to prevent people from sliding down that slippery slope.We must also provide the necessary resources and support to those addicted and those in recovery. Too many relapsed addicts share similar stories of falling back into a cycle of drug abuse by the weight of their past mistakes and inability to re-enter their communities after rehab or incarceration.Because addiction is a disease, not a moral failing, we must treat it as such.Until recently, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs almost exclusively treated chronic pain with prescription opioids. Because our nation’s veterans suffer from chronic pain at a rate double the national average, it should be no surprise that this treatment method led to their rates of fatal overdoses also be double the national average.Our nation’s heroes deserve our very best care, and while the VA has taken steps to curtail the over-prescription of addictive opioids, there is still much work to be done. That’s why Secretary of Veteran’s Affairs David Shulkin visited the Coatesville, Pa., Veterans Affairs Medical Center on Friday to host a roundtable to discuss the successes and continued work being done in the VA to combat the opioid epidemic.This type of engagement and community discussion is what leads to the policies we’re fighting for in Washington. The conversation must be open and ongoing, but it must also be coupled with action.Every moment we wait to act, the crisis gets worse.I am proud of the work our president and Congress are doing, and will continue to champion, to combat the opioid epidemic.Ronna Romney McDaniel is Chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.", 'Gen. Jack Keane on President Trump\'s upcoming trip to Asia and whether the president\'s trip can help establish a better relationship with China. The White House says President Donald Trump will not visit the Demilitarized Zone during his upcoming trip to Asia -- a break from many previous administrations.A senior administration official told reporters during a White House background briefing Tuesday that there\'s not enough time in the president\'s schedule to accommodate a visit to the border zone that has separated the North and South for 64 years.Trump will be visiting Camp Humphreys, a military base about 40 miles south of Seoul, to highlight the U.S.-South Korean partnership and burden-sharing, instead. Trump was invited to visit the base by Korean President Moon Jae-in toTrump\'s trip comes amid his escalating rhetoric and taunts against North Korean leader Kim Jung Un and the country\'s nuclear program. In a recent speech at the United Nations, Trump said he would "totally destroy" the nation, if necessary. He also derided Kim as "little Rocket Man."Every president but one since Ronald Reagan has visited the DMZ -- often wearing bomber-style jackets and flanked by military officers. Trump\'s predecessor, Barack Obama, visited during a 2012 trip to Seoul and told troops stationed at the border that "the contrast between South Korea and North Korea could not be clearer, could not be starker, both in terms of freedom but also in terms of prosperity."But the White House official noted only a minority of American presidents have made the trip to the heavily fortified border since it was established in 1953 and said that Trump administration officials, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Vice President Mike Pence have all made the trip. Pence said his trip let North Koreans "see our resolve in my face."The White House had played down the notion that the hesitance to visit the DMZ stemmed from security concerns -- though experts on the region say a visit could have been risky given the current tensions.Trump will depart Friday for a trip that will take him to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. The president will be attending several summits, hold a series of bilateral meetings, will be feted at banquets and spend time golfing with Japanese President Shinzo Abe.Trump will also be meeting for the first time with Pilipino President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been accused of human rights abuses, including killing suspected drug dealers. The White House has said that Trump could raise concerns with the program.But the official said on Tuesday that Trump and Duterte shared a warm rapport during a telephone conversation. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to preview the president\'s itinerary and aims on the record.', 'SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico – A few miles from the air base where President Donald Trump was touting his administration\'s response to Hurricane Maria, Puerto Ricans were stacking fallen tree branches, pieces of zinc roofing and sewage-soaked clothes in shopping carts and piling them on street corners alongside piles of wet mattresses.There is still no power in the neighborhood known as Playita, and water only came back Sunday. No trucks have come to clear debris in the heart of the capital of Puerto Rico and the few hundred residents of this neighborhood of wood and cinderblock houses are still cleaning sewer water from their homes and business. They say they have not seen federal officials since Maria struck the island on Sept. 20."The need is everywhere," Jacke Cordero, 51 said as he used a pressure-washer to spray reeking floodwater out of his small cafe, the Corner of Faith. "Water, food, the supermarkets are closed."Ray Negron rested nearby in the shade of a church after a morning spent collecting debris."What more do they want us to do?" said Negron, who is 38 and unemployed. "We\'ve already cleaned everything up."He said the residents of Playita were waiting for officials to take away the massive piles of trash that residents had collected."Nobody\'s come," Negron said. Addressing a distant Trump, he said: "Please, stop marginalizing us."Playita has long been one of San Juan\'s least-favored neighborhoods, cut off by a highway but close to a housing project that has been receiving a relatively high degree of attention in the recovery effort.Soon after the storm, residents went to a highway overpass to hang sheets emblazoned with messages pleading for help from the local and federal governments: "Playita needs food and water. SOS."Janelys Melendez, a 39-year-old evangelical minister, said no one should mistake Playita\'s pleas for help with an unwillingness to do things for themselves."You can see Puerto Rico lifting itself up here. No one\'s lying back," she said. "They\'re doing what they can. It\'s everyone\'s responsibility, not just the government\'s."As she spoke, convenience store-owner Raymond Ortiz walked through Playita handing out Styrofoam containers of rice and beans he and his wife had cooked for people who didn\'t have enough to eat.He said the Salvation Army had distributed aid in Playita in recent days, but he had seen no federal effort."We\'re doing what we can," he said. "We really need help. Trump should come help us."As he spoke, Trump was visiting Guaynabo, one of San Juan\'s wealthiest neighborhoods and one that has recovered fastest from the storm.Trump highlighted Puerto Rico\'s relatively low death toll compared with "a real catastrophe like Katrina" as he opened a tour of the island\'s devastation Tuesday, focusing on the best of the reviews he and his administration are getting rather than criticism of the federal response to Hurricane Maria.Trump pledged an all-out effort to help the island but added: "Now I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you\'ve thrown our budget a little out of whack because we\'ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico. And that\'s fine. We\'ve saved a lot of lives."The burdens of recovering from the storm in a city where people are saving their gas and traffic rush-hour heavy throughout the day helped keep a couple of small protests against Trump\'s visit down to a handful of people who gathered outside the city\'s convention center and near the air base where the president spoke.Other Puerto Ricans said they appreciated the president\'s visit, and there was praise for Trump even in Playita, where retired government human resources manager Lucy Falero, 70, said, "We have to appreciate this trip.""We\'ve never had a president who\'s visited after a disaster like this," she said. "One has to congratulate the president for his motivation."', "MANILA, Philippines – Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte (doo-TEHR'-tay) has sanctioned a bloody drug war that features extrajudicial killing. And this week, he boasted that he killed a man with his own hands.All that may well go unmentioned in public by President Donald Trump when the leaders hold talks Monday.Breaking with his presidential predecessors, Trump has largely abandoned publicly pressing foreign leaders on human rights.He has instead shown a willingness to embrace international strongmen for strategic gain.White House officials have suggested that there is a strategy behind Trump's flattery of Duterte — namely to avoid having the Philippines strengthen ties with China.", '', 'JERUSALEM – Under pressure from the United States, Israel has delayed a bill that would connect a number of West Bank settlements to Jerusalem, officials said Sunday.The bill aims to solidify the city\'s Jewish majority, but stops short of formal annexation, making the practical implications unclear. The bill says the communities would be considered "daughter municipalities" of Jerusalem.Israel\'s hard-line government has been emboldened by the Trump administration\'s more sympathetic approach to Israel and its settlement enterprise than that of President Barack Obama, and the draft bill is part of a series of pro-settler steps the government has taken in recent months.Still, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sought to remain in President Donald Trump\'s good graces.Israel\'s Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as saying Israel needs to coordinate the bill with the U.S."The Americans turned to us and inquired what the bill was about. As we have been coordinating with them until now, it is worth (to continue) talking and coordinating with them. We are working to promote and develop the settlement enterprise," it quoted Netanyahu as saying at a government meeting Sunday.Earlier Sunday, David Bitan, the Likud party\'s parliamentary whip and a close Netanyahu ally, told Israeli Army Radio the vote was delayed because "there is American pressure claiming this is annexation."Trump has sent an envoy, Jason Greenblatt, to attempt to breathe life into moribund peace talks, which collapsed under U.S. tutelage in 2014. The effort so far appears to have yielded little progress.Trump has presented Israel with a more lenient approach to its settlements than his predecessor. While the administration has said that settlements are "not helpful" to advancing peace with the Palestinians, Trump\'s Mideast team, headed by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, is led by people with deep ties to the settler movement.Unlike Obama, Trump does not demand a settlement construction freeze, though he has urged restraint. Nor does he demand the establishment of a Palestinian state, breaking from two decades of U.S. policy.Trump has backed away from a campaign promise to relocate the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a key Israeli wish, sparking rare criticism from Israeli lawmakers.Since Trump\'s election, Israel has pushed a pro-settlement agenda that has included a bill meant to legalize hundreds of settler homes built on private Palestinian land. It has approved the first new West Bank settlement in two decades and greenlighted the construction of thousands of new homes.The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war, as part of their future state, a position that has wide international backing. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally and considers the entire city its undivided capital.Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement watchdog group, says the bill would amount to "de facto annexation" and be a clear step toward full annexation of the West Bank.Israel says the fate of the settlements, home to more than 600,000 Israelis, should be decided through peace talks along with other core issues like security.', '                                    Dickinson, Texas was among the cities hardest-hit by Hurricane Harvey in August.                                                                             (REUTERS/Rick Wilking)                                                                    A civil rights group on Friday called unconstitutional a Houston suburb\'s hurricane repair grant program that says residents cannot boycott Israel as a condition of receiving any money. The American Civil Liberties Union said it\'s considering legal action against the city of Dickinson over its Hurricane Harvey repair grant program, which will provide money to people whose homes and businesses in the city were damaged. The grant program\'s application has a section in which individuals have to acknowledge they "will not boycott Israel during the term of this agreement." "The Supreme Court has made very clear that participation in political boycotts is fully protected by the First Amendment," said ACLU staff attorney Brian Hauss. The boycott language was included to comply with a new state law prohibiting Texas agencies from contracting with companies boycotting Israel, said David Olson, the city attorney in Dickinson, located about 30 miles southeast of Houston. The law, which took effect Sept. 1, prohibits all state agencies from contracting with, and some public funds from investing in, companies that boycott Israel. Olson said it\'s unclear if the new law applies to the city\'s grant program, funded by more than $1 million in private donations for victims. The confusion exists because once the city took control of the money, it became public funds and Dickinson had to create a grant program to distribute them, he said. The city classifies individuals receiving the grants as independent contractors. "We\'re just trying to do what\'s right, comply with state law and make sure the residents get every benefit that we can lawfully give them," Olson said. Dickinson was one of the areas hardest hit by Harvey\'s torrential rainfall in late August. More than 7,300 homes in the city were damaged, displacing about 7,900 residents. Dickinson is waiting to hear back from state officials on whether the law applies to the city\'s grant program and if it doesn\'t, "then there\'s no reason for us to have it in the agreement," Olson said. "The city does not take a political stance on the (boycott) itself. They are not for or against it," he said. Hauss said the main issue in this case is the state law and the ACLU\'s belief that the law is "fundamentally unconstitutional." Twenty-one states, including Texas, have passed laws that prohibit them from entering into contracts with individuals or companies participating in a boycott of Israel. Earlier this month, the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit in Kansas on behalf of a teacher challenging that state\'s boycott law. "The state cannot condition government benefits, ranging from disaster relief to just access to government contracts, on the forfeiture of ... First Amendment rights," Hauss said. Olson said Dickinson officials hope to have heard back from the state by next Tuesday\'s city council meeting so a decision can be made on whether to change the grant program\'s no boycott requirement.', 'GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip – The Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group in Gaza, says five of its members who have been missing since Israel demolished a militant tunnel dug from Gaza into Israel this week have died.The group said on Friday the militants\' remains are on the Israeli side of the tunnel after searching for them on the Palestinian side.It vowed revenge "at a suitable time." Both Gaza\'s Hamas rulers and neighboring Egypt are not interested in an escalation and are trying to maintain calm for now.Israel detonated the tunnel inside its territory on Monday in a rare flare-up along the tense border that has remained mostly quiet since a 2014 Israel-Hamas war.Seven other militants, including two Hamas members, suffocated in the tunnel trying to rescue the five on Monday.', 'Is Germany Still a Haven for Israelis? After Election, Some Wonder - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — Some freaked out.“That’s it, friends. We can pack,” Avishai Milstein wrote on a Facebook page for Israelis living in Berlin, after the far-right Alternative for Germany shattered a post-World War II taboo by gaining a bloc in Parliament.Others, glancing around the globe — to other European nations, to the United States, and even back home to Israel — comforted themselves with the fact that the far right remains far from taking control in Germany.“I don’t think this is a game-changer,” said Guy Weinberger, 47, a Tel Aviv native who co-founded a marketing company in Berlin. “Trump won. Here, they have only 12 percent.”Sunday’s national elections in Germany prompted a fresh round of questions about populist election gains across the West. But for many Israelis, thousands of whom have flocked to Berlin in recent years for its socially liberal politics, thriving arts scene and economy, both the campaign and the result were especially problematic.The Alternative for Germany’s anti-immigration positions and its leaders’ extreme statements, some echoing the language of neo-Nazis, were impossible to ignore. They included calls for Germans to take pride in the performance of their soldiers in the world wars, a lament over a Holocaust monument in Berlin, and a suggestion that a government minister be “disposed of” in Turkey, her family’s homeland.Were the very things that have made Germany seem so safe to so many Israelis — the national preoccupation with contrition, aversion to raw nationalism, and determination never to repeat the sins of the past — now in danger of being shunted aside by a new generation unburdened by collective guilt and determined to assert its national identity?Was Israel’s special relationship with Germany, too, now in danger?Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hastened to say that it was not, announcing Tuesday that he had spoken with Chancellor Angela Merkel. He congratulated her on winning and expressed confidence that Israel and Germany would only deepen their ties.But Mr. Netanyahu added that Israel was “concerned about the rise of anti-Semitism” on both the political right and left, and noted that “there are two different things: denying the Holocaust and denying responsibility.” He called on Ms. Merkel’s new government to “act to strengthen the forces in Germany that take on the historical responsibility.”Among the opposition, Amir Peretz, a Knesset member from the left-of-center Zionist Union, wrote on Twitter in German that the election was “a bad day for Germany democracy, with the entry of xenophobes and open anti-Semites into the Bundestag.”Yet like so much else dividing Israeli society today, the advances by the Alternative for Germany, or the AfD, as it is known, seems to provide more of an excuse for political recriminations and partisan bile than a source of common Jewish ground.On the right, there was newfound scorn, and worse, for Israeli expatriates in Germany.Aryeh Eldad, a former Knesset member and medical professor, wrote in Maariv of his revulsion at the “20,000 Israelis who moved from Israel to Germany of their own free will,” whether for “cheaper housing and cheaper cottage cheese” or to live under “the wonderful German democracy” out of a “distorted” leftism. Both groups, he said, were “emotional cripples.”“These Israelis,” Mr. Eldad wrote, “are not like the dog that comes back to eat his own vomit, but rather like the vomit that returns to the dog that spewed it.”On the left, there was renewed criticism for the Israeli government that so many left behind when they moved to Germany.Michael Sappir, a 29-year-old in Tel Aviv who earned a degree in linguistics at the University of Leipzig, in Saxony, and now works in high tech, said the election “makes me think twice about the idea of moving there again, both as a Jew and a leftist.”But, he added, “the situation in Germany is much, much better than here, where the governing coalition is composed mostly of parties that are intellectually akin to the AfD.” He said, “What’s considered the terrifying right wing there is on many policy points just mainstream here.”Even after Sunday’s election, Mr. Sappir said, he still believes he would be safer in Germany than in Israel. “The norms of governance, the rule of law, there is much stronger,” he said. “Here I feel like an embattled minority. There I know that we’re a much bigger minority, and there’s at least a pretty broad anti-fascist consensus.”Eldad Beck, an Israeli journalist and author of a book on German-Jewish relations, said left-wing Israelis in Germany who were surprised by Sunday’s vote were “suffering from blindness.” But he also said that he knew some Israelis in Germany who had voted for the AfD “because they consider the arrival of so many Muslims and the violence, terror and criminality a big problem that has to be stopped.”Indeed, feelings about the subject do not fall into neat categories, even among left-leaning Israelis.Mr. Weinberger, the marketing executive in Berlin, said he believed that, aside from anti-Merkel sentiment, what had driven Germans to the AfD was an understandable emotion: “There are strong feelings of fear,” he said. “It’s part of human nature at some point. And some of them I’m sure are really concerned about this open-door policy. It affects their lives.”Shai Levy, 44, a Jerusalem-born filmmaker in Berlin, said he was saddened to see Israel and the Jewish people fueling the resurgent right wing “because they have a common enemy; being anti-Muslim is considered to be good for the Jews.”He sees many Israelis newly arrived in Berlin tensing up at the sight of people in Muslim head scarves, a “reflex of phobia for Muslims,” he said, adding: “I know it because I had it. I needed to get rid of it.”Where Germany goes from here, and how Israel and Israelis will adjust, will depend less on Ms. Merkel than on those who succeed her when she leaves the stage, said Mr. Beck, the author of “Germany, at Odds.”“As long as Merkel is chancellor, the special relationship is O.K.,” he said. “But Israelis will have to make a special effort, otherwise things are going to fall apart.”He said that the millions of Muslims who have arrived in Germany in recent years would inevitably influence the country’s politics.“I’m not so sure the young generations of German politicians feel as connected to Israel and to the past,” he warned. “And I don’t see yet that Israel is really making an effort to convince them why it is doing certain things and why it’s important to do those things.”Younger Israelis, too, can be frustrating to their elders.To Miki Goldman, 92, a survivor of Auschwitz and other concentration camps who later helped collect evidence against Adolf Eichmann, diplomacy is one thing, but emigrating to Germany another.“Undoubtedly Germany of today is a democracy, but it still has a kernel of something else that could become dangerous,” he said. “We can be in good relations with Germany, but why do young Israelis have to forget the fate of their fathers and go back there?”But some Israelis in Germany insisted they were neither forgetful nor naïve.Ruthi Grossman, 24, a student who moved to Berlin last year, said she still planned to stay there.“I think it’s just part of the world moving toward dark times,” she said of the rightward drift. “But I do trust Germany more than I trust any other country in the world to deal with it morally, because of that history.”', 'Anti-Semitism in Germany - The New York TimesTo the Editor:Re “A Landmark Election Raises a Few Concerns for Israelis in Germany” (news article, Sept. 27):One cannot assess the extent and danger of prejudice and discrimination based on election results alone. Recently, the German Parliament addressed an extensive study by the Independent Expert Group on Anti-Semitism. The results of this study were troubling.Anti-Jewish attitudes were more extensive and pronounced than many expected and than was hoped, but that accurately reflected the often unacknowledged tenacity of anti-Jewish prejudice in Germany among a large sector of the population. The German Jewish community has suffered from a disturbing rise in anti-Jewish attacks in recent years and has been increasingly under threat.Even greater efforts than the already significant ones undertaken by the German government are required to combat anti-Jewish attitudes and other forms of racism, prejudice, bigotry and discrimination that undermine German democracy and its commitment to freedom, equality and justice for all citizens.NOAM SCHIMMEL, BOSTONThe writer is an associate fellow at the Center for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism, McGill Faculty of Law.', "JERUSALEM – The Israeli military has taken a preliminary step before demolishing the West Bank home of a Palestinian gunman who killed three Israelis.The military also set up checkpoints around the villages of Beit Surik and Bidu on Wednesday, which neighbor the settlement where Tuesday's attack took place.Nimr Mahmoud Ahmed Jamal killed three Israelis and critically wounded a fourth outside the West Bank settlement of Har Adar before he was shot dead.The army says engineers mapped out Jamal's home in Beit Surik, west of Jerusalem, ahead of its demolition.Israel demolishes the homes of Palestinian attackers as a deterrent measure, but Palestinians consider the policy collective punishment.Israel also canceled the entry permits of several of Jamal's relatives in response to Tuesday's attack.", '', "BEIRUT – Lebanon's chief military prosecutor has indicted an actor and writer on charges of collaborating with Israel and possessing drugs.The prosecutor's statement Thursday came nearly a week after Ziad Itani's arrest.

Itani has apparently admitted to the charges.No trial date has been set.Lebanon and Israel are formally at war and collaborating with Israel can be punishable by death.", 'JERUSALEM – The U.S. ambassador to Israel raised eyebrows Thursday by saying that Israel occupies a tiny portion of the West Bank — just 2 percent — and that settlements there are part of the Jewish state proper.The comments angered the Palestinians and are at odds with decades of U.S policy in the Mideast."I think the settlements are part of Israel," American Ambassador David Friedman said in an interview with the Israeli news site Walla.He refrained from answering when asked if settlements would be removed in a peace agreement with the Palestinians."They (Israelis) are only occupying 2 percent of the West Bank," he said.A State Department spokeswoman later said Friedman\'s remarks "should not be ready as a change in U.S. policy.""I\'m aware of what he said," spokeswoman Heath Nauert told reporters in Washington. "His comments — and I want to be crystal clear about this — should not be read as a way to prejudge the outcome of any negotiations that the U.S. would have with the Israelis and the Palestinians. It should also not indicate a shift in U.S. policy."Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 war. The Palestinians have limited autonomy in 40 percent of the area, with Israel in full control over the remaining 60 percent. Palestinians demand the West Bank as part of a future state.The Palestinians, along with much of the international community, view Israel\'s West Bank settlements as illegal and an obstacle to peace. Israel disputes this, saying the fate of the settlements must be resolved through negotiations with the Palestinians."Obviously, there is important security considerations to those settlements, there\'s important nationalistic, historical and religious significance to those settlements and I think the settlers view themselves as Israelis, and Israel views the settlers as Israelis," Friedman said.Nabil Shaath, an aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, responded in a video clip on Twitter that the U.S ambassador had displayed "absolute ignorance of facts of law and of the position of the United States."Friedman\'s remarks are "very bad news for the future of any American attempt to make peace in the Middle East," Shaath added.Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat called Friedman\'s comments "false and misleading." He said in a statement that "such positions undermine ongoing efforts toward achieving a just and lasting peace between Israel and Palestine," based on 1967 borders.Friedman is a member of President Donald Trump\'s team spearheading efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.Friedman, Trump\'s former bankruptcy attorney, was appointed ambassador earlier this year, a move that was opposed by Democrats and some Jewish groups because of donations to Israeli settlements, opposition to Palestinian statehood and vocal support for hard-line Israeli government positions.In an interview to the Jerusalem Post earlier this month Friedman referred to the "alleged occupation" of Palestinian territories. The State Department later clarified that his comments did not reflect a change in U.S. policy.Trump has called an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord "the ultimate deal," and has sent envoys, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, to meet with the two sides.

It also was not known who was operating the drone.In September, Israel also shot down an Iranian-made drone sent by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in the same area.

Bannon at a gala dinner in New York on Sunday night. What a disgrace.What a mistake, too.It’s a disgrace because no organization that purports to represent the interests of the Jewish people should ever embrace anyone who embraces anti-Semites. Jews have enemies enough. To provide those enemies with moral cover for the sake of political convenience or ideology corroborates the worst anti-Semitic stereotypes and strengthens the hand of those who mean us harm.That means that when a far-left group such as Jewish Voice for Peace makes common cause with someone like Linda Sarsour — the Palestinian-American activist who advocates the elimination of Israel as a Jewish state and publicly praised a convicted terrorist — it disqualifies itself as an advocate of any Jewish interest save its own. To deny Israel’s right to exist, as U.N. Secretary General António Guterres noted in April, is “a form of modern anti-Semitism.”It also means that when a right-wing Jewish group such as the ZOA chooses to overlook Bannon’s well-documented links to anti-Semitic white nationalists, it puts itself on a moral par with J.V.P. Bannon is the man who expressly called Breitbart News “the platform for the alt-right,” knowing full-well the toxic range of opinion encompassed by the term. Bannon is also the guy who only last month got around to disavowing his long and productive association with Milo Yiannopoulos, neo-Nazi Richard Spencer’s favorite chanteur.Spencer thinks Jews have no place in the United States. Breitbart has sung the praises of Spencer. Bannon knows all this because he edited the article that sung those praises. Connect the dots.That, however, is something the ZOA has seemed unwilling to do, on the theory that Bannon is a self-declared, and possibly even sincere, supporter of the Jewish state. On Sunday he called himself a “Christian Zionist,” and praised Israel as “one of the greatest nations on earth and the foundation of the Judeo-Christian West.”But just as there are anti-Zionist Jews, there are also anti-Semitic Zionists. The Nazis initially endorsed the idea of getting German Jews to shove off to Mandated Palestine. Spencer calls himself a “white Zionist,” on the factitious theory that Israel is the sort of ethno-nationalist state he’d like to see America become.Simply put, support for Israel is a necessary but not sufficient condition for being a friend to Jews. (Richard Nixon, who was nothing if not an ally of Israel in its time of need, was known to tell aides that “most Jews are disloyal” and that “you can’t trust the bastards.”) That distinction may not trouble the right-wing ZOA audience that gave Bannon a standing ovation, but it should profoundly alarm all Jews who call themselves pro-Israel.Why? Two reasons. Unlike Nixon, whose anti-Semitism seems to have been of a knee-jerk and atavistic variety, Bannon’s alt-right views — his opposition to free trade, a liberal immigration policy, “international bankers,” “corporatist global media” — are consonant with a sinister worldview that always finds a way to get back to a certain class of rootless cosmopolitans. His is not a personal bigotry so much as it is an ideological obsession. Its potential for destructiveness is that much greater.The second reason is that political support for Israel is too important to tarnish through association with the likes of Bannon or European kindred spirits such as Holland’s Geert Wilders or Hungary’s Viktor Orban. Israel is not a latter-day Crusader kingdom holding out against a 21st-century Mahometan horde. It is a small democracy trying to uphold a set of liberal values against autocrats and religious fanatics sworn to its destruction. Zionists love Israel because of the way in which it brings together the values of individual freedom and Jewish civilization, not because of some blood and soil nationalism.If Israel is going to retain mainstream political support, it cannot allow itself to become the pet cause of right-wing bigots and conspiracy theorists. That requires putting serious distance between Bannon and every pro-Israel organization, to say nothing of the Israeli government itself, by refusing to provide a platform for him and his ilk. Personal and national reputations alike always depend on the company one keeps. Not every would-be supporter deserves consideration as a friend.That thought may have dawned on Sheldon Adelson, who skipped Sunday’s dinner and seems belatedly to have realized — too late for much comfort — how destructive Bannon and his brand of arsonist politics have become to the Republican Party and the causes it used to champion. The thought needs to dawn, too, on right-of-center Jews who have become so attuned to dangers from the woke-left that they have tuned out dangers from the alt-right.Anti-Semitism is both the socialism of fools and the conservatism of creeps. If the past century holds a lesson for Jews, it’s to beware every form of illiberalism, including the illiberalism of those who purport to be on our side. Repair of the world may not be the central teaching of Judaism. But it’s always wise to stay far from those who wish to tear it asunder.', '', 'Sabbath Railway Work in Israel Shakes Netanyahu’s Coalition - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, already embroiled in corruption scandals, scrambled on Sunday to stabilize his governing coalition after an ultra-Orthodox minister in his cabinet, citing Jewish values, resigned on his rabbi’s orders.Yaakov Litzman, the health minister, quit in protest over railroad repair work that was carried out on Saturday, the Jewish day of rest.Though the government did not appear to be in imminent danger of collapse, the resurgence of the Sabbath wars, a perennial issue in Israeli politics, was just the kind of trouble that some analysts said could eventually unravel the coalition and lead to early elections.“If some solution enabling him to return to the Health Ministry isn’t found in the next few weeks, his resignation is liable to herald the beginning of the end of the fourth Netanyahu coalition,” Yossi Verter, the political analyst of the liberal Haaretz newspaper, wrote on Sunday of Mr. Litzman’s resignation.Mr. Litzman’s party, United Torah Judaism, holds six seats in the 120-seat Knesset, or Parliament. Despite his resignation, his party has not quit the coalition. Mr. Netanyahu’s other ultra-Orthodox coalition partner, Shas, with seven seats, has also shown no desire to leave a government that has so far brought benefits to the ultra-Orthodox public — known in Hebrew as Haredim, or those who fear God — including funding for its institutions.This Netanyahu government, with a total of 66 seats, depends on both parties for its majority.“All the indications are that nobody is interested” in breaking up the coalition, said Abraham Diskin, a professor emeritus in the department of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “But it is impossible to prophesy; I don’t know how it will end.”Some Haredi-run news media outlets have increasingly pressured politicians, and their spiritual guides, to take a firmer stance on issues related to what they see as desecration of the Sabbath.Commentators noted that the health minister’s resignation over work done on Saturday could put Aryeh Deri, the leader of Shas and the interior minister, in a difficult position, at risk of being seen by supporters as not defending the sanctity of the Sabbath.Mr. Deri kept a low profile on Sunday and boycotted the weekly cabinet meeting.On the instructions of his rabbi, Mr. Litzman had demanded that the railway maintenance work be carried out on a weekday, which would mean creating large traffic jams on the country’s roads and inconveniencing tens of thousands of Israeli commuters.“To my regret Israel Railways has recently turned the Sabbath into ‘national renovations day,’” Mr. Litzman told reporters after submitting his resignation, which is scheduled to go into effect within 48 hours.Under a decades-old, delicate agreement to maintain the status quo between Israel’s secular and religious sectors, the public transportation system, including the state-owned railway, is largely dormant for the duration of the Sabbath, from sundown on Friday to nightfall on Saturday.“The Sabbath is important to us, and so are the needs of all citizens of Israel, including, of course, the need for safe and continuous transportation,” Mr. Netanyahu said at the start of the cabinet meeting.Mr. Netanyahu, plagued by graft investigations involving illicit gifts of cigars and champagne, among other things, worked quickly to minimize the damage and keep his government on track.In a meeting later on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu reached some agreement with Haredi party leaders, including quickly introducing legislation to limit the opening of convenience stores on the Sabbath. He declared his coalition to be “strong and stable.”Mr. Netanyahu plans to serve as health minister for the time being, and to promote legislation allowing Mr. Litzman to return as a deputy minister of health in a way that would give him administrative responsibility for the ministry without serving as a full minister for government decisions he opposes on religious grounds. Israel’s Supreme Court ruled against such an arrangement two years ago.Mr. Litzman said he would consider returning as deputy minister only after the convenience store law had passed.Previous governments have faced crises and even fallen over issues like airplanes landing on the Sabbath.', "Raw video: Vice president commemorates U.N. vote 70 years ago.They sat in the same seats, in the same room, and heard the words praising Israel from the same podium from which the nation would be established 70 years ago.“In this room they called for the creation of the Jewish State of Israel,” declared Vice President Mike Pence.“I am deeply humbled to join you today to commemorate this vote and to celebrate the courage, the perseverance, and faith of the Jewish people that made it possible.”The vice president, Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin, ambassadors from 60 nations and the Israeli delegation gathered to commemorate the event in the room where the historic United Nations vote was held on November 29, 1947. Resolution 181 approved the partition of separate Arab and Jewish states, supervising the withdrawal of British forces from Palestine. The resolution passed by a vote of 33 to 13, with 10 abstentions and 1 nation absent.The vice president used the commemoration to reaffirm the Trump’s administration strong support for the Jewish State.“Under our administration, America will always stand with Israel,” he said to applause.“Israel needed no resolution to exist, for Israel’s right to exist is self-evident and timeless. Nor did that resolution create the State of Israel. For Israel was born of the sweat and the sacrifice of the Jewish pioneers who risked everything to reclaim their beloved lands, with, in those well-remembered words, with a plow in one hand and a rifle in another. They turned the desert into a garden, scarcity into plenty, and an age-old dream into a reality. And their striving and their sacrifice laid the foundation for what took place in this hall 70 years ago.”The site of the vote, in the New York City borough of Queens, temporarily housed the fledging United Nations General Assembly at the time. The building was originally constructed as the New York City Pavilion for the 1939 World’s Fair, and is now the home to the Queens Museum. But seven decades ago the imposing limestone edifice housed the newly created world body from 1946 to 1950. The U.N. then moved across the East River to its iconic glass and steel headquarters on First Avenue in Manhattan in 1952.Today, the hall was recreated as it looked seven decades ago. The vice president and other speakers stood at the same beige wood podium, speaking into the same 1940s style microphones that announced the birth of the Jewish State.“It was an ancient promise cherished by Americans since before our nation’s founding, and it was a promise the Jewish people clung to through all the ages, through a 2,000-year exile, the longest of any people, anywhere. And they were rewarded for their faith,” Pence said.“The United States of America was proud to support Resolution 181. We were proud to be the first nation in the world to recognize Israel’s independence soon after. And we were proud to stand by Israel and the Jewish people ever since.”Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the United Nations to commemorate the vote 70 years ago toward the creation of Israel.(Shahar Azran)Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, told Fox News that the day not only commemorated the historic vote, but also his nation’s progress since then.“It’s also a celebration of what we have achieved in the last 70 years. We are proud of Israel that we see today, we are proud that the Vice President Pence is ... with us,” he said, noting that both nations are working toward a lasting peace plan with the Palestinian Authority.“We know that the president is pushing forward with his peace initiative, we are working with the president. We will make sure that, in every initiative, the security for Israelis and the security of Israel will be a top priority for us.”During his speech, Pence also focused on what he called “the menace of radical Islamic terror,” which has so sadly struck Israel, Europe, and most recently the United States.“It does not matter what name it takes, Hezbollah, Hamas, al Qaeda, or any other, you can be assured that we will defeat the forces of terror, so they can no longer threaten our people, our allies, or our way of life,” Pence vowed.He also called out Iran, describing it as “the leading state sponsor of terrorism.” He said the administration is working on changing the Iran nuclear deal and reiterated the promise from Trump, that the U.S. “will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.”After Pence spoke, a film showing the original vote was shown in the hall. As the original roll call was held, the voice from decades ago again echoed in the cavernous hall as it did on that day in 1947, ending in the applause from delegates from so many years ago.Pence also reminded those present that the threats the Jewish people faced back then continue to this day.“History attests that enmity toward the Jewish people often turns from evil thought to evil action. And over the years, there has hardly been a day when the people of Israel have lived without war, or the fear of war, or the grim reality of terror. But no matter the challenges they face, or the slanders they endure, the Jewish people always persevere. For even in the darkness, the light of their faith, their strength, and their hope shines bright.”Pence will embark on an official visit to Israel next month.Fox News' Ben Evansky contributed to this report.Follow Eric Shawn on Twitter:@EricShawnTV", 'UNITED NATIONS – The U.N. envoy for the Mideast says Israel isn\'t complying with a U.N.

It felt like summer camp for adults as they sang songs from the 1980s in English and Hebrew. In a way it was.The site, Tel Kabri in Upper Galilee, is an excavation of a nearly 4,000-year-old Canaanite palace about a half-hour inland from the biblical town of Akko, Israel. The 50 or so archaeologists and would-be archaeologists of all ages were at work this past summer to illuminate daily life in the middle Bronze Age, from about 1800 to 1550 B.C.Four years ago, team members found one of the largest wine-cellar storerooms from before the Middle Ages. Inside, they discovered three-foot-tall amphoras, made of local clay, that contain the residue of red wine and tree resins, which acted as a long-term preservative. Now, they plan to replicate the wines with the aid of modern techniques.The archaeologists believe that the jars, discovered in four storerooms since 2013, would have held the equivalent of about 20,000 bottles of wine, giving clues to the importance of wine in everyday life thousands of years ago. With advancements in DNA technologies, the archaeologists hope to identify the type of grape that was used and to reproduce an ancient indigenous variety for wine production. An untouched floor drain in one of the site’s rooms may contain grape pips that can be tested for DNA.“All wine was resinated in those days,” said Andrew Koh, associate director of Tel Kabri and assistant professor of archaeology at Brandeis University, referring to the preservatives found in the jars. “The only resin wine today is Greek retsina because, with modern bottling techniques, we don’t have to worry about wines turning.”By radiocarbon dating the charcoal in the rooms, they discovered that the wine dates to about 1550 B.C., in the middle of the Canaanite period and before any record of Judaism. These ancient beverages were flavored with juniper berries, mint, honey and cinnamon, possibly to mask the acrid taste of the resin.Wine did not originate in Galilee, but rather on the upper Tigris River, in the Caucasus Mountains of Armenia and Georgia some 10,000 years ago, then spread to other parts of the region and into Greece, the Middle East and Egypt. In Palestine, grapes were not commercially cultivated for wines until Baron Edmond de Rothschild brought European grapes from Bordeaux in the late 19th century.“But what is exciting is that here at Kabri we are able to see the process of winemaking rather than just reading about it from ancient texts,” said Eric Cline, co-director of the excavations and a professor of classics and anthropology at George Washington University.Tel Kabri was found by accident, like many archaeological sites, in the 1960s when workmen were digging ditches for water pipes connecting springs in the north to Nahariya and Akko. When archaeologists started excavating shortly thereafter, they found a plaster floor of a palace near the huge wine storeroom. Less than 10 percent of the site has been explored so far.From pottery found through the years, the archaeologists know that the inhabitants of the palace drank their wine from a ceramic cup, unique to the site, today called the Kabri goblet. Among the artifacts there were clues to the sea and land travel of the inhabitants, including a local imitation of a scarab from Egypt and potsherds from Greece.As the volunteers tap with picks, fragments are given to archaeologists to determine if they are bone, ceramic or an artifact. Animal bones reveal much about who was eating there. The front left parts of the animals were considered the choicest for eating, while the right front parts were for sacrifice to the gods. A found piece of bone from an aurochs, an extinct cow that was typically seven feet tall and weighed one ton, provided insight into the scale of ancient banquets.“If you figure half a pound of meat a person, one aurochs could feed 1,000 people,” said Assaf Yasur-Landau, co-director of the project and a professor of archaeology at the University of Haifa. “The meal could have been for the heads of households of a city state.“Since they had no utensils with which to eat, the meat was boiled or roasted, scooped up with flatbread and washed down with wine. “It is like eating shawarma and pita, but a little more elegant,” Dr. Cline said.The size of the ancient rooms is also revealing. A 30-foot-square space could accommodate 100 people standing or sitting on stools and footstools at receptions where nuts and olives were probably served. Olive pits, intact or broken, are often found at the site. Intact pits indicate olives used for eating, while broken pits from heavy stone mills were used to make oil.“By working together, we are finding bits of information to understand the economy of Kabri and what happened here,” Dr. Cline said. “And we are trying to find out what catastrophe destroyed this place — was it too much or too little water, an earthquake, disease, abandonment or something else?”As the team carefully sieve through the layers of ancient terroir, they never excavate an entire site, leaving a part of it for future generations.“We know that, because of new technology, techniques and interpretations, we or others will do it better in the future,” Dr. Cline said. Then he paused. “We live for these summers. They are a great escape from the real world.”Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

But in the past eight years under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that fight has become much more difficult. Bills we once thought the Knesset would never allow to be even introduced are now the law of the land. This crackdown has included the entrenchment of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, but also government support for McCarthy-like witch hunts of undesirable progressive activists — many of which have targeted the New Israel Fund, the organization I lead, and the progressive Israeli nonprofits we fund.Now these hard-line tactics are showing up in American policy, too.I do not support the so-called Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel, also known as B.D.S. In fact, far from boycotting Israel, my colleagues and I raise and donate millions of dollars every year to build progressive civil society there. Still, I oppose legislation currently before American lawmakers that would impose grave penalties on Americans who engage in boycotts of Israel or “Israeli-controlled territories,” or in other words, Israeli settlements in the West Bank.Similar legislation has been proposed or passed in various forms in more than 40 American states. And while this gag bill in Congress is supported by some American Jewish organizations, others fiercely oppose it, as do rights groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed suit against one such law in Kansas on Oct. 11, the first law suit challenging the constitutionality of these laws.These measures undermine fundamental democratic values dear to both Israelis and Americans; they are also an extension of a damaging policy that originates in the Netanyahu government and that seeks to reverse half a century of American policy and remove any possibility of a two-state solution.Civil liberties advocates oppose these proposals because they violate the constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression. The gag bill is largely based on a 2011 Israeli law that creates civil liability for Israelis who call for or support calls to boycott Israel and that was strongly opposed by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.But the gag bill before Congress goes even further, potentially creating both civil and criminal penalties for Americans who exercise their constitutionally protected right to free speech. Violating the Constitution in this way hurts Americans and does nothing to help Israel. In fact, it undermines progressive Israelis, who are working against this legislation in their own country.Even some of the bill’s initial supporters are taking a closer look. Notably, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, withdrew her sponsorship for the legislation, saying: “I cannot support the bill in its current form if it can be interpreted as stifling or chilling free speech. I would never put my name on legislation that would do that.”Like the Kansas law being challenged by the A.C.L.U., the bill before Congress also undermines 50 years of American foreign policy and hurts Israeli democracy. That’s because it — like the Israeli laws upon which it is based — specifically includes “Israeli-controlled territories,” making no distinction between boycotting Israel and boycotting the settlements in the occupied territories. Through this intentional conflation, the bill erases the boundary between the State of Israel and the territories it captured during the 1967 Six Day War and has occupied since. This directly contradicts American policy, which has consistently held Israel’s settlements to be “illegal” or “illegitimate.”Refusing to distinguish between Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories is a strategy the current hard-line government of Israel and the anti-Israel boycotters share.The Israeli far-right does this by funding, expanding and potentially annexing settlements, and by normalizing the settlements, especially in the minds of Israelis, as indistinguishable from the rest of Israel. Last month, the government sponsored an event celebrating 50 years of settlements; Mr. Netanyahu has declared that the West Bank is “the inheritance of our ancestors” and settlements are “here to stay, forever.”On the other hand, anti-Israel boycotters consider all Israeli products and institutions equally untouchable. They oppose targeting “only companies implicated in Israel’s occupation” as a half-measure, only acceptable when pursued “tactically,” not because of a recognition that there is a difference, both practically and under international law, between Tel Aviv and an illegal settlement in the West Bank.The endgame of Israeli policy here is potentially disastrous. If the border between Israel and the occupation is truly erased, so, too, will the potential for a two-state solution, still the stated goal of Israel, the Palestinian Authority, the United States and the European Union, and the best and most realistic resolution of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.After the Six Day War, Israelis found themselves in a dilemma about their future. Israel was a democracy, Israel was a Jewish state, and Israel controlled Palestinian territory beyond its internationally recognized borders. Fifty years later, the dilemma remains the same. Israel can choose to be two of those things — but not all three. If Israel is to remain the realization of the Jews’ right to self-determination, it cannot continue to control and occupy the Palestinian territories.But in service of their agenda to destroy any chance for a two-state solution, Israeli hard-liners and settlement lobbyists are willing to compromise fundamental freedoms. The United States should not sacrifice its own sacred constitutional principles in order to help them.', "NICOSIA, Cyprus – Greece's defense minister says plans are being drawn up for joint air force drills with Cyprus, Israel, Egypt and other European countries as part of efforts to bolster stability in the eastern Mediterranean.Panos Kammenos' remarks Sunday came after a military parade in the Cypriot capital to commemorate the 57th anniversary of the ethnically divided island's independence.The parade included the overflight of a pair of Greek Air Force F-16 jets, the first showing of the Greek warplanes at the event in 16 years.The island's Greek Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades said there will be no let-up in efforts to reunify Cyprus, despite July's collapse of peace talks with breakaway Turkish Cypriots.Russian-made BUK surface-to-air missiles were also put on the display at the parade.", 'JERUSALEM – Israel\'s nationalist government may be unpopular with Western liberals and much of its domestic press corps, but it has found a close friend among the world\'s evangelical Christians and their media outlets.The government this week is hosting a first-of-its-kind summit for Christian journalists, featuring softball questions, mutual admiration and a welcome respite for embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. His outreach to evangelical leaders reflects striking tactical parallels to his close ally and fellow media basher, President Donald Trump.About 130 journalists from some 30 countries are participating in the four-day summit, which ends Wednesday. The world\'s largest broadcasters, including the Christian Broadcasting Network, Daystar, Trinity Broadcasting Network and God TV, are all represented.Nitzan Chen, the director of Israel\'s Government Press Office, said he believed the summit was long overdue, and that planners chose the 50th anniversary celebrations of Israel\'s capture of east Jerusalem as a fitting occasion for the conference.For many years, Israel has held a summit for Jewish media outlets, cultivating those journalists as unofficial "ambassadors" to help promote Israel\'s image abroad, he said. "Using the same logic," it decided to reach out to Christian media, in what could become a regular event.The summit\'s agenda includes meetings with top Israeli politicians, most from the nationalist side. Palestinian speakers barely appear on the agenda.Sessions include discussions on archaeology and Jewish-Christian relations, but also "radical Islam" and alleged media bias, legal "warfare" and Palestinian "incitement" against Israel. While Israel\'s West Bank settlements are largely vilified in the West, participants are offered a chance to visit one.The media summit extends what has become a warm relationship between Israel and its evangelical supporters.Local charities raise millions of dollars from Christian friends around the world, and evangelical Christians make up a sizeable segment of the tourism industry. Last week, thousands of Christians gathered in Jerusalem for an annual celebration and parade coinciding with the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.According to Israel\'s Tourism Ministry, evangelical Christians account for roughly one-fifth of all Christian tourists visiting the country. Among American Christian visitors, the number of evangelicals is much higher, at nearly 40 percent."The evangelical market is one of our main target audiences," said Eyal Carlin, director of the ministry\'s Americas department. He said the ministry advertises in Christian media, sponsors trips for influential community leaders and works with Christian tour operators to offer visits with "faith-based or biblical themes."Gordon Robertson, chief executive of the Christian Broadcasting Network and a summit participant, said evangelical support for Israel was deep and heartfelt.He described Israel\'s modern-day history, from its founding in 1948 to its capture of east Jerusalem in 1967 to scenes last week of children laughing and playing in his Jerusalem hotel, as fulfilling biblical prophecy — the bedrock idea seemingly driving the Evangelicals\' support.He also talked of his strong personal affinity for Israel and the Jewish faith, noting that he enjoys studying the Hebrew Bible. "I like to joke, the longer I\'m a Christian the more Jewish I become," he said.CBN, known best for its "700 Club" show and which claims a worldwide audience of 360 million people, delivered its first satellite broadcast from Jerusalem\'s Mount of Olives in 1976. Today, its Jerusalem operation is "one of our most productive bureaus in the world," he said.While Robertson, the son of famed televangelist Pat Robertson, said he did not consider himself to be a direct partner of the Israeli government, he said, "I think we can be a partner with the Israeli people.""Israel is obviously in a very difficult position with the Palestinians, with the Arab world, and there needs to be a voice that\'s independent from Israel, saying, \'wait a minute, Israel is actually doing the right thing.\'" He said.That strong support for Israel was evident at Netanyahu\'s meeting with the visiting journalists.Netanyahu, who routinely spars with local media and has accused them of reporting "fake news" in their coverage of a series of corruption scandals, received a warm welcome."Good to see you, my friend," said one journalist before asking a question. "There\'s no fake news here."Netanyahu\'s embrace of the Christian media echoes the strategy employed by Trump.White evangelicals were a core constituency that propelled Trump to victory in last year\'s election. And even after the tumultuous start to his presidency, they remain staunch supporters. Trump, along with members of his administration and his family, have appeared regularly on CBN.Robertson said that Christian voters were drawn to Trump in part because of his strong support for Israel. "It\'s absolutely an issue. It will absolutely determine a vote," he said.Ahmad Majdalani, an aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said evangelical support for Israel is well-known but difficult to understand. He said that both Palestinian Christians and Muslims are harmed by Israeli policies."I think those evangelical people are deluded by the Israeli propaganda," he said. "I recommend they go to Bethlehem and see the large swatch of Christian land that was confiscated and turned into Jewish settlements."Robertson echoed the Israeli claim that the Palestinians have rejected repeated peace offers and refused to recognize Israel\'s right to exist as a Jewish state.He also rejected a common "accusation" in Israel that evangelical Christians are here to convert Jews or prepare for the End of Days."We really truly stand with Israel, and we really truly want to be dear friends," he said.Not everyone agrees. Jeremy Ben Ami, president of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group in Washington that is often critical of the Israeli government, said the evangelicals do not necessarily have Israel\'s best interests in mind."Israel should be wary of embracing extreme Christian Zionist groups that may be more concerned with their own theological agendas than with Israel\'s long-term survival as a secure, democratic homeland for the Jewish people," he said.', 'Israel Moves Ahead on West Bank Settlements, but Guardedly - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — Israel is moving ahead with plans for a significant expansion of its settlements in the occupied West Bank, including apartments in the volatile city of Hebron and the first approval of a new settlement in 20 years.But while the latest plans call for the eventual construction of thousands of new homes on the West Bank, when Israeli officials meet this week to review them, only several hundred housing units appear likely to be granted final approval.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is once again maneuvering on familiar ground, trying to balance the demands of his pro-settlement coalition partners with the opposition from the international community.In restricting the number of final approvals now, however, his government may also be taking into account some other Israeli priorities. Among them are the campaign against Iran and the joint interests he has been pushing with Arab countries like Saudi Arabia, with which Israel has no formal diplomatic relations.When the Israeli government announced last week that a planning committee convening on Tuesday and Wednesday would promote plans for 3,736 new housing units — which are at various stages of the long approval process — opponents of Israeli settlement in the West Bank were outraged. Critics in the pro-settlement camp were not satisfied, either, accusing Mr. Netanyahu of recycling announcements of plans that were still in their early stages of approval and engaging in political spin.According to calculations by both sides, about 600 housing units will receive final approval before building. Final approval is also expected to be given for an additional 459 housing units in the urban settlement of Ma’ale Adumim, east of Jerusalem, though in that case bids for construction still need to be issued.Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy of the Yesha Council that represents the settlers, complained that the amount of building being approved “does not accommodate even the natural growth” of the settler population.The Trump administration has been more accommodating than its predecessors when it comes to Israeli settlement activity. But it has also called for restraint as it tries to foster a resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process with regional support and a coalition against Iran’s regional ambitions.“That’s the tension: a government that wants to satisfy, or not upset, the American administration,” Mr. Revivi said, “and the demands of citizens whose needs are not being kept.”Based on several meetings he had with Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Revivi believes the Trump administration has not really drawn clear lines about what settlement it could live with.“They said to the prime minister, ‘We are not going to put any limits on you, but just make sure that what you do doesn’t get us upset,’ Mr. Revivi said. “I think that’s where Prime Minister Netanyahu is: not knowing just how much he can pull the strings without getting the American administration upset.”Most of the world considers the settlements, built in the territory that Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war — the heartland of any future Palestinian state — to be a violation of international law.Hagit Ofran, who monitors construction for Peace Now, a leftist Israeli advocacy group that opposes settlement activity, said there had been a sharp acceleration in the promotion of plans compared with the last two years. The rate now, she said, is similar to that in 2014, which was a bumper year. (The relative slump in 2015 and 2016 might have been due to a glut.)“The strategy is to confuse us,” Ms. Ofran said. And Israel, she said, is now allowing itself to build in places where it has held off for decades.For example, approval is being given for 31 new apartments in the Jewish settlement in the heart of the contested and volatile city of Hebron, although that project is expected to be held up by a legal challenge by Hebron’s Palestinian-run City Hall.And for the first time in 20 years, final approval is also being given for a new settlement, Amihai, to accommodate the families who were evacuated from the illegal Israeli outpost of Amona, which was built on private Palestinian land.A bid for construction is expected to be issued for 300 units in the Beit El settlement that the government has been promising since 2012. And heavy machinery has been spotted in recent days carrying out soil-boring tests at Givat Hamatos, an area over the 1967 lines in southern Jerusalem. According to Peace Now, the infrastructure work is being done in preparation for the issuing of bids for the construction of 1,600 housing units in the area.Anti-settlement groups say the construction in Givat Hamatos would drive a wedge between predominantly Palestinian East Jerusalem neighborhoods and Bethlehem, harming the contiguity of any future Palestinian state. The past promotion of plans there have prompted international condemnation.In its official statement last week, the government declared: “During 2017, approximately 12,000 housing units in different stages of planning and construction will be approved, about four times the amount in 2016. Whoever claims that this is not a significant improvement is misleading the public.” But hinting at the need to take Israel’s broader interests into account, the statement also said, “Whoever believes that diplomatic considerations need not be taken into account is greatly mistaken.”“There is nobody,” the statement concluded, “that does more for settlement, steadfastly and wisely, than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.”Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, condemned the latest settlement plans. “Clearly, Israel is bent on entrenching the military occupation and its illegal settlement enterprise,” she said, “further reaffirming its intentions of displacing Palestine and replacing it with ‘Greater Israel.’”Bezalel Smotrich, an Israeli lawmaker from the staunchly pro-settlement Jewish Home party, which sits in Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, wrote a scathing online post accusing the prime minister’s staff of issuing “a sea of lying numbers.”Mr. Smotrich blamed the Americans for not authorizing plans for industrial zones by the settlements, in part because they take up a lot of space. “Without industrial zones there is no employment, no livelihood and no existence,” he said.The planning committee meeting this week convenes four times a year. Shaul Arieli, an Israeli expert on political geography who prepared maps for past negotiations with the Palestinians, and who is a strong advocate for the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, said final approval for about 600 units has become relatively “routine.”But in the past, he said, about 75 percent of new building was inside the so-called settlement blocs, meaning areas mostly close to the 1967 line that Israel intends to keep in any future agreement with the Palestinians, possibly in return for land swaps. Over the last six or seven years, he said, up to half the new building has been deep in the West Bank, outside the blocs.', "                                    Israel's ambassador to the U.N. accused a human rights investigator of 'hateful incitement' for reporting on abuses in Palestinian territories -- but leaving out actual Palestinian abuses.                                                                            (AP Photo/Osamu Honda, File)                                                                    A special investigator assigned by the United Nations Human Rights Council to look into abuses in the Palestinian territories left out any mention of actual Palestinian abuses in his report. He instead released a litany of complaints and charges against Israel.In one small section of his report, Michael Lynk did try to give the impression of being evenhanded, writing, “The Rapporteur notes that human rights violations by any State party or non-State actor are deplorable and will only hinder the prospects of peace.”However, at a press conference at the world body in New York, Lynk, the U.N. special rapporteur, admitted to journalists that he did not add human rights abuses by either the Palestinian Authority or Hamas to his report because that was not in his mandate to do so, even though his title seemed to indicate it was.When he was asked about it, Lynk seemed unaware that two of his predecessors had in fact included these abuses during their tenures.But that wasn’t the end of it: U.N. Watch, a human rights group based in Geneva, released a letter to Lynk calling on him to investigate human rights abuses by Palestinians.“By any definition of human rights, morality and logic, if Mr. Lynk is a United Nations human rights monitor for the Palestinian Territories, he must address Palestinian Authority and Hamas torture and arbitrary arrest committed against their own people,” said Hillel Neuer, the executive director of U.N. Watch.Neuer listed examples of human rights violations enacted against its own citizens by both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority that included jailing of journalists, the suppression of peaceful protests, torture, torture of juveniles and extrajudicial killings. He also cited the killing of Israelis in terror attacks, suicide attacks and kidnappings by Palestinian terror groups.Israeli ambassador Danny Danon in 2016.(UNTV via AP)Lynk said that Fox News and other journalists were confusing his mandate: “It is not aimed at Israel, it’s aimed at Israeli occupation of a territory that’s not its own. That is a distinct and separate question, and those who wind up confusing the two do so, I suggest, deliberately to obfuscate the question of the 60-year-old occupation.”Lynk did concede, however, that he possibly would consider asking the council when he next reports in March to expand his mandate to include Palestinian abuses.Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon fired off a statement following his press conference accusing Lynk of spreading hateful “incitement against the State of Israel.”“The U.N. Human Rights Council has lost its legitimacy as it focuses obsessively on attacking Israel instead of working on resolving the real human rights problems plaguing the world. The Council has lost all touch with reality and the original intent of upon which it was founded,” Danon said.Lynk asserted that he has the independence to choose his topics under the framework of his mandate given to him by the council.Anne Bayefsky, professor and director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and Holocaust, told Fox News that Lynk’s title gives the opposite impression of what he actually does.“Link demonstrates how dangerous the U.N. Human Rights Council really is,” she said. “The Council gave him the misleading title of U.N. human rights expert investigator, knowing in advance he had made up his mind about the subject he was to investigate. Lynk went into the U.N. job wildly anti-Israel, and voilà, he now produces statements and reports containing wild anti-Israel pronouncements, starting with analogies to apartheid South Africa.”The Trump administration is said to be strongly considering pulling the U.S. out of the much maligned Human Rights Council just as it recently did when it left another U.N. body, UNESCO, citing amongst other reasons its anti-Israel bias.Ben Evansky reports for Fox Newson the United Nations and international affairs.He can befollowed@BenEvansky", 'Israel Carries Out Airstrike on Syrian Anti-Aircraft Battery - The New York TimesThe Israeli Air Force attacked a Syrian antiaircraft battery on Monday that Israel said had fired a missile at its planes while they were on a reconnaissance mission over neighboring Lebanon.No Israeli planes were hit, the Israeli military spokesman Lt.-Col. Jonathan Conricus said. The counter-strike took place two hours later and “incapacitated” the antiaircraft unit located 30 miles east of Damascus, he said.“We know according to our intelligence it was a battery controlled by the Syrian regime and we hold the Syrian regime responsible for the fire,” Colonel Conricus said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later issued a statement saying Israel would not hesitate to defend itself.“Today there was an attempt to harm our aircraft; this is unacceptable to us. The air force acted quickly and accurately to destroy what needed to be destroyed,” Netanyahu said.“Our policy is clear. Whoever tries to harm us, we will strike at him. We will continue to act in the region as is required in order to defend Israel.”ADVERTISINGBut the Syrian Army said it struck an Israeli warplane that had breached its air space at the Syria-Lebanon border.“The Israeli enemy this morning violated our air space... Our air defense mediums confronted it, hit one of its planes directly and forced it to flee,” the Syrian military statement said.Over two hours later, Israel launched several missiles that hit a military position in the Damascus countryside and only caused material damage, it said. The Syrian Army warned Israel against the “grave consequences of repeated aggressive attempts.”Syria and Israel, while old enemies, have rarely traded blows directly since a 1974 cease-fire ended their last conventional war.Monday’s incident was additionally unusual given its publication by Israel, which rarely gives details on its air force activities over Lebanon and Syria to foil suspected arms transfers to Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters.Such missions in Syria have increased drastically during the country’s six-and-a-half-year-old civil war, Israeli officials say. All efforts, they say, are made to avoid accidental clashes with Russian forces helping Damascus beat back insurgents.Russia’s defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, began a visit to Israel later on Monday but did not mention the airstrike during public remarks at the start of a meeting in Tel Aviv with his Israeli counterpart, Avigdor Lieberman.“I would like to talk about the things related to Syria,” Mr. Shoigu said. “The operation there is close to the end. There are several problems which require urgent solution and the prospects of further development of the situation in Syria require discussion.”Colonel Conricus said the Israeli military had informed Russia of its Syria strike “in real time or immediately before” it took place, and would brief Shoigu.The Lebanese Army says Israeli aircraft regularly violate Lebanon’s air space.Colonel Conricus said a Syrian attack on Israeli Air Force planes over Lebanon was unprecedented. Syrian antiaircraft missiles were launched at Israeli warplanes over Syria in March. They were unscathed but one of the missiles, on its descent, was intercepted by Israel’s Arrow air defense system.According to Colonel Conricus, the Syrian battery struck on Monday had carried out the launch against the Israeli planes in March.', 'JERUSALEM – Israel\'s chief of staff has reduced the prison sentence of a soldier convicted of fatally shooting an incapacitated Palestinian attacker last year.Elor Azaria began an 18-month prison term in August after he was found guilty of manslaughter in a case that sharply divided the country, where military service is mandatory.Lt.

She added, “With this anti-Israel bias that’s long documented on the part of Unesco, that needs to come to an end.”While the United States withdrew from the group, the Trump administration said it wanted to continue providing American perspective and expertise to Unesco, but as a nonmember observer. The withdrawal goes into effect at the end of 2018, but that decision could be revisited, officials said.If Unesco returns “to a place where they’re truly promoting culture and education on all of that, perhaps we could take another look at this,” Ms. Nauert said.Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization popularly known for its designation of World Heritage sites, is a global development agency with missions that include promoting sex education, literacy, clean water and equality for women.In a lengthy written statement, Irina Bokova, Unesco’s director general, expressed regret at the decision and said that the American people shared the organization’s goals.“Universality is critical to Unesco’s mission to strengthen international peace and security in the face of hatred and violence, to defend human rights and dignity,” she wrote.In 2011, the United States stopped funding Unesco because of what was then a forgotten, 15-year-old amendment mandating a complete cutoff of American financing to any United Nations agency that accepts Palestine as a full member. Various efforts by President Barack Obama to overturn the legal restriction narrowly failed in Congress, and the United States lost its vote at the organization after two years of nonpayment, in 2013. Unesco was dependent on the United States for 22 percent of its budget, then about $70 million a year.During the Cold War, the United States withdrew from the agency in 1984 because the Reagan administration deemed the organization too susceptible to Moscow’s influence and overly critical of Israel. President George W. Bush pledged in 2002 to rejoin the organization in part to show his willingness for international cooperation in the lead-up to the Iraq war.Cultural organizations in the United States criticized the decision, saying Unesco played a key role in preserving vital cultural heritage worldwide.“Although Unesco may be an imperfect organization, it has been an important leader and steadfast partner in this crucial work,” said Daniel H. Weiss, the president and chief executive of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.Ms. Bokova said she had repeatedly told members of Congress that immediate payment of the arrears was not an issue, only American political re-engagement in the organization, which she said she believed served many American interests abroad.Ms. Bokova, in a telephone interview, said she “thought the decision was coming but why now, I don’t know, in the midst of elections” for a new director to succeed her.France and Qatar were running neck-and-neck in the race to lead the cultural body after a third round of voting Wednesday whittled the field to five. Hamad bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari of Qatar and Audrey Azoulay of France — both former culture ministers — had 18 votes each.Behind them in the secret ballot was an Egyptian career diplomat, Moushira Khattab, with 13 votes, and Tang Qian of China with five, according to results posted on Unesco’s website.Ms. Bokova argued that Unesco is “so relevant to the political agenda of the American government it’s incredible,” citing its work on trying to prevent violent extremism through educational and cultural programs in the developing world. Unesco’s largest literacy program is in Afghanistan, she said, and Unesco is also working in Libya and Iraq to train teachers and preserve cultural heritage in liberated areas. It has always worked against anti-Semitism and to preserve the memory of the Holocaust, Ms. Bokova said.Analysts said that withdrawing from the organization was a significant escalation by the United States in its criticism of United Nations bodies.“This is another example of the Trump’s administration’s profound ambivalence and concern about the way the U.N. is structured and behaves,” said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator and adviser in Republican and Democratic administrations.In July, Unesco declared the ancient and hotly contested core of Hebron, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as a Palestinian World Heritage site in danger, a decision sharply criticized by Israel and its allies. And in 2015, Unesco adopted a resolution that criticized Israel for mishandling heritage sites in Jerusalem and condemned “Israeli aggressions and illegal measures against freedom of worship.”The Trump administration has made the defense of Israel on the global stage a key tenet of its foreign policy. After he was elected but before he became president, Mr. Trump made an extraordinary intervention on the world stage by criticizing the Obama administration’s decision not to block a United Nations resolution criticizing Israeli settlements. Mr. Trump has pledged to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv and selected a pro-settlement ambassador.Nikki R. Haley, the United Nations ambassador, has repeatedly criticized the United Nations for what she called its anti-Israel bias.In a statement released Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel praised the move by the United States and pledged to withdraw Israel from the organization as well.“This is a courageous and ethical decision because Unesco has become a theater of the absurd and instead of preserving history, distorts it,” Mr. Netanyahu said.For President Trump and for Mr. Netanyahu, the recognition of World Heritage sites in the Palestinian territories, like Hebron and the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, and the 2015 resolution and another in 2016, showed an anti-Israel bias.The 2016 resolution condemned Israel’s “escalating aggressions” regarding a holy site in Jerusalem’s Old City, known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount. It was submitted by the Palestinians, was supported by 24 countries, with six opposing it and 26 abstaining. It referred to the holy site only using Muslim names and prompted angry reactions from Israeli politicians.', "JERUSALEM – Israel is set to advance plans for nearly 2,000 housing units in West Bank settlements next week, including 30 homes in the flashpoint Palestinian-majority city of Hebron.The Civil Administration's planning committee announced Tuesday that it will review plans for 1,844 units in Jewish settlements across the West Bank during next week's meetings.Most of the plans are in the preliminary stages, including the first expansion of the Jewish settlement enclave in Hebron since 2002. Nearly 900 units are set for final approval, including 459 houses in Maale Adumim, a major settlement east of Jerusalem.The Palestinians and most of the international community consider Israel's West Bank settlement construction illegal and an obstacle to peace. Israel disputes this, saying the fate of settlements should be decided in negotiations.", 'New Trailer: Denzel Washington Is ‘Roman J. Israel, Esq.’ - The New York TimesDenzel Washington sports a throwback Afro in the new trailer for “Roman J. Israel, Esq.,” an apt look for a film that appears to pay homage to gritty urban courtroom dramas of an earlier era like “… And Justice for All” with Al Pacino and “The Verdict” with Paul Newman. Those movies earned their stars best actor nominations, and it wouldn’t be a surprise if Mr. Washington joined this year’s Oscar race.With seven acting nominations (including one for 2016’s “Fences”) and two wins (for “Glory” and “Training Day”), Mr. Washington can almost never be counted out as a contender. In this case, he’s working with the writer-director Dan Gilroy, who snagged a best original screenplay nomination for another dark urban drama, “Nightcrawler” (2014).Mr. Washington plays a legendary civil-rights attorney who finds himself involved with a big-money firm and a slick-suited Colin Farrell.

Some years ago, Yahdon Israel, a Brooklyn-based writer, began posting photos of fashionable readers around New York City on Instagram with #literaryswag. That spawned the Literaryswag Book Club, an interview series talking to writers about books and culture called Lit, lots of fodder for his essays, and, now, a chance to shape the conversation as the new editor in chief of Brooklyn Magazine and editorial director of Northside Media. Mr. Israel, 27, who got his M.F.A. in Creative Writing from the New School, has been traveling the city and absorbing street fashion and how people talk since childhood, when he tagged along with his father, a musician and incense-seller. He lives in a Bedford-Stuyvesant brownstone with friends.UNPLUGGED My Saturday is just my Friday. So Sunday is the day I decompress. If I’m being honest, Sundays are for chilling. I wake up pretty late. I cook, French toast and turkey bacon. I watch “Martin.” I turn my phone off. It’s an energy-drain, scrolling for no particular reason.FASHION SPEAK I pull from everything around me and try to put them into conversation — Spike Lee, Air Jordan. It’s about cultural literacy, the language of being fly. If I’m going shopping, I’m hitting Bloomingdale’s on 59th and Lexington, and Brooklyn Circus on Nevins, which is where I host the book club. It’s more window shopping. I ask, ‘What do I have in my wardrobe that keeps me fluent in what’s going on?’ ‘What outfit will allow me to enter into as many possible spaces?’ I might get one piece.WHAT SWAG IS I was born in the South Bronx. I have one brother and three sisters. We lived in shelters and navigating the housing system. My mom made our clothes from scratch. Her father was a tailor. She knew fabrics, she knew texture. “Don’t just go by the brand.” She was big on instilling in us that we were more than what we had in our pockets. She was big on making sure we weren’t Frankensteined together. That’s what swag is.LIKE STOCKS I watch sales like stocks. I watch them to the point where they practically can’t find the other shoe, which is another reason to go shopping on Sunday, because it’s chill, it’s more relaxed. One of the stores to go to is Scotch & Soda. They make the best denim at a good price.BAR NONE I’m reading so many books. “You Play the Girl,” by Carina Chocano, about how women are playing a supporting role in their own lives. Aja Monet’s poetry collection, “My Mother was a Freedom Fighter.” It shows the price women pay. I wish you more freedom, less fighting! And this brilliant book, “The Art of Death,” by Edwidge Danticat. A lot of the writers I read since reading Hilton Als are women. The emotional intelligence and how to navigate it is bar none. Women are the best writers. People don’t say it enough. They save the flowers for after you’re gone.TAKEOUT, RESEARCH I go to Bed-Stuy Fish Fry. I get a catfish dinner, mac ’n’ cheese, collard greens and turkey meatloaf. I’ll bring it home. I’ll be binge-watching — documentaries, news and TV shows. I see it as research. Recently, I watched “The Defiant Ones,” about Dr. Dre; Puff Daddy’s documentary, “Can’t Stop Won’t Stop”; and the show “Insecure.”SIGNATURE COCKTAIL I call it Mard'ussé. It’s Martinelli’s and D'Ussé cognac. You drink it past the leaves, on the label, and you pour in the cognac. The name suggests something upscale, but it’s like, ‘You just poured cognac in an apple juice bottle!’ I’m a fan of elegance intersecting with accessibility. It’s my gin and juice.EMOTIONAL MAP Sunday is mostly solo. I’ll make a lot of phone calls. Friends, friends’ moms, ex-girlfriends — friends before, friends after, right? I’m just seeing how people are doing. When I was younger, I was always asking for something. ‘Can I have $1?’ I asked myself, ‘How could I be a plus, not a minus?’ I asked myself, ‘How can I let them know they’re seen, they’re on my emotional map?’ALWAYS SUNNY When I’m going to bed, I always put on, “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” I’ll check in to see what’s happening on the ‘gram. I haven’t learned the art of saying no — Sunday evening is when the phone comes back into play. Seeing what the emails look like, what the ‘gram looks like.", "BEIRUT – The Syrian army says Israeli forces have struck one of its positions near the Golan Heights south of the country.The army statement said Saturday's shelling by Israeli troops came after Syrian opposition fighters fired mortar rounds that hit an open area in the Israeli-occupied Golan giving the Jewish state a pretext to bomb the army.The army said the shelling caused material damage without saying if there were casualties.Saturday's shelling came two days after the Israeli military said it has struck Syria in response to a mortar fired from the territory.Israel has largely stayed on the sidelines of Syria's civil war.In one rare incident, Israel this week struck an anti-aircraft battery deep in Syria after it had opened fire on Israeli jets flying over Lebanon.", 'JERUSALEM – A group of American rabbis is demanding that Israel halt the reported sales of arms to Myanmar, where hundreds of thousands of people have fled violence by government security forces.T\'ruah, a New York-based group of rabbis supporting human rights, says Thursday that 300 rabbis and cantors signed a petition calling for an end to the alleged arms sales.A statement from Israel\'s Foreign Ministry said Israel "vehemently denies" reports of its "alleged involvement" in the Myanmar conflict.Israel has not publicly commented on reports that it has sold weapons to Myanmar in the past.

The American government explained its decision to withdraw from the organization as a response to its “anti-Israel bias.” The United States, a spokeswoman said, does not want to pay the hundreds of millions of dollars that it owes to Unesco until the organization’s anti-Israel bias comes to an end.This should have been music to Israel’s ears, right? Not necessarily, even though Israel promptly announced that it would pull out of Unesco on the United States’ heels.There’s no doubt that the Trump administration is right about Unesco’s unhealthy attitude toward the Jewish state. The organization’s shameful record makes clear that it is obsessed with Israel: Unesco has passed resolutions with the sole aim of rejecting the historic connection between Jews and the Holy Land, including denying Jewish ties to the Temple Mount. In July, it declared the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, an important holy site for Jews, as a Palestinian World Heritage site “in danger” — presumably from Israel.Israel has, appropriately and almost unanimously, been incensed: It called Unesco “shameful and anti-Semitic” and described its decisions as “bizarre and irrelevant.” In July, the Israeli government decided to cut $1 million from its payments to the United Nations in retaliation.Several United Nations agencies have similar anti-Israel tendencies. In fact, the entire United Nations is biased against Israel. It tends to pass one-sided resolutions when Israel is engaged in a conflict; it pays constant attention to Israel and its supposed misbehavior, while other countries, guilty of much worse, barely get mentioned for censure.This is hardly a secret. In March, the deputy assistant secretary of state said that the United States is “deeply troubled” by the United Nations Human Rights Council’s “consistent unfair and unbalanced focus on one democratic country, Israel.” Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, has vowed “to stand up to the U.N.’s anti-Israel bias.” Even Ban Ki-moon, the organization’s previous secretary general, acknowledged the bias against Israel in his final speech before the Security Council: “Decades of political maneuverings have created a disproportionate volume of resolutions, reports and conferences criticizing Israel,” he said.None of this is new. The United Nations’ hypocrisy and bias has been a constant irritation since Israel was founded. It was David Ben Gurion, the country’s founding prime minister, who coined a derisive phrase, “Um Shmum,” that remains popular in Israel today. (“Um” is the Hebrew pronunciation of the United Nation’s initials; the “sh” prefix is a way of signaling dismissal.) Attitudes haven’t changed much since then: In 2009, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argued that “the jury is still out on the United Nations” and that “recent signs are not encouraging.”And yet despite all this, Israel still chooses to be a part of the United Nations. Even amid Unesco’s repeated, ridiculous resolutions, the Israeli government resisted the temptation to withdraw from the organization. Israeli policy toward Unesco was — like its policy toward the rest of the United Nations — pretty simple: Remain a member and fight as hard as you can. Be a player. Do not give Israel’s foes what they want, which is Israel cast aside and ostracized by the international community.Sometimes (though admittedly not often), Israeli even has the chance to achieve something at the United Nations. For example, just before the Trump administration announced its plan to withdraw, Unesco delayed a vote on an anti-Israel resolution. It might not sound like much, but Israel’s envoy to Unesco  described it as an “achievement” that was “the result of three years of exhausting, frustrating and difficult diplomatic work.”Enter President Trump. An Israeli strategy 70 years in the making is suddenly severely undermined. (According to news reports, the American decision was made without consulting the Israeli government.) Mr. Netanyahu then announced that when the United States quits Unesco, Israel will follow suit. It has no alternative. Israel can’t possibly let the United States leave an organization over anti-Israel bias and still remain a member itself. At the same time, Israel also can’t appear ungrateful toward the United States and hint that leaving Unesco might not be the best move for Israel.But the truth is, Israel would prefer to continue its longtime strategy at the United Nations: staying a member and fighting for Israel’s interests. Israel would rather work on getting Unesco to improve — become a little less hostile, and even more so, less obsessed with Israel. But now that option seems to be in danger.It’s possible that the election of the former French culture minister, a Jewish woman who has relatives in Israel, to lead Unesco might be a signal that the agency will improve. Or, perhaps, a recognition on the part of other Unesco members that the Trump administration won’t tolerate their anti-Israel shenanigans will sober up the organization.But this can work only if Mr. Trump’s motivation for quitting Unesco is truly to curb its anti-Israel bias. If, on the other hand, his main motivation is to free the United States from paying for something he does not value, then he hasn’t helped Israel.

One woman, Jocelyn Meinhardt, was his son Adam’s ex-girlfriend.

And just last year Horovitz grabbed the breasts of 21-year-old Maia Ermansons, she said.“I felt close to him like a grandfather, but also he was a somewhat famous guy whose time I felt privileged to have,” Ermansons told the paper. “For the man who represented all that, to treat me the way he did, was the ultimate betrayal.”“I believe the allegations against my father are true, and I stand behind the women that made them”Horovitz, 78, told The New York Times he has “a different memory of some of these events, I apologize with all my heart to any woman who has ever felt compromised by my actions, and to my family and friends who have put their trust in me.

But the remarkable tale it tells — of a family split up and dispersed to different continents, and the detective work required to figure out what had happened — turns this documentary into a fascinating mystery of reshuffled identities. In this time of mass displacement across the globe, it is a stark reminder of how traumatic the refugee experience often is.At 3, Izak Szewelewicz was sent by his mother, Aida, to Israel from Bergen-Belsen to be raised by foster parents. “It was the best I could do,” she says simply when interviewed. Aida herself immigrated to Canada and would visit Izak on rare occasions. But she never told him that he had a younger brother, or that his father had taken the brother but that she didn’t know where. Izak learned of this when he was 67, in 2013. The Schwarzes, Izak’s nephews, assisted him while filming this unfolding account.With the help of investigators and archives in Europe, Canada and Israel, Izak meets his brother, Shepsel, who is blind and living in Winnipeg. But the teary reunion and Shepsel’s first nervous meeting with Aida are just the start. As Izak and Shepsel try to assemble their family history, questions abound. Friends of Aida recount bits of background she had shared. At 89, though, Aida remains evasive: She doesn’t recall that man with her and the boys in that Bergen-Belsen photo; she’s fuzzy on why she moved to Canada without Shepsel and his father. The film is called “Aida’s Secrets” for good reason.', 'Jews of the Diaspora Bring Their Cause to the Israeli Public - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — In June, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel abruptly suspended a hard-won accord to give non-Orthodox Jewish men and women a more dignified place to worship together at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, and then moved to bolster Orthodox control over conversions to Judaism in Israel, the backlash was swift and fierce.Protesters rallied outside Mr. Netanyahu’s home. Powerful American allies angrily demanded meetings. Philanthropists in the diaspora threatened to cut off their aid to Israel.Insults flew. Mr. Netanyahu accused the Reform movement, which has many adherents in the United States but relatively few in Israel, of using the Western Wall agreement to gain recognition in the country “via the back door, secretly.”Reform and Conservative Jewish leaders accused the prime minister of lying and trying to incite the ultra-Orthodox against them. The Sephardic chief rabbi of Jerusalem likened Reform Jews to Holocaust deniers.With old arguments over who is a Jew playing out nastily again in public, it seemed that major portions of American and Israeli Jewry were heading for a damaging breach.In the Old City on Monday, visiting leaders of the Reform and Conservative movements who had pressed for the changes at the Western Wall could do little more than fume, as a minister in Mr. Netanyahu’s government described for them a weak consolation prize: minor improvements to the tucked-away space where mixed-gender prayer has long been confined, largely unseen and all but undiscoverable to those who are not specifically looking for it.“A few little crumbs,” Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, bitterly called it.Yet rather than ratcheting up the name-calling war with Mr. Netanyahu’s government, Rabbi Jacobs and other leaders of the Jewish Agency of Israel — a group that supports Jewish diversity and inclusion and that helped negotiate the Western Wall agreement — now say they are starting an ambitious campaign to influence public opinion about the needs of diaspora and less-religious Jews where they are understood least, and where their political clout is feeblest: in Israel itself.On Tuesday, 120 of the group’s international board of governors plan to descend on Parliament, meeting with dozens of Israeli legislators, including some members of the ultra-Orthodox parties, in what Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident who leads the Jewish Agency, called “our biggest lobbying effort ever.”“The problem is not just that the prime minister gave in to political pressure,” he said in an interview. “The ministers feel that they don’t have to pay a political price, and that’s because there’s not that much awareness” of the needs of non-Orthodox Jews. “So we’re doing a lot of other work to make Israeli society know this problem better.”The lobbying day is to be followed by an advertising and media campaign, educational efforts in Israeli schools and trips for Israeli lawmakers and leaders to the United States “to give them a real-life glimpse of what and who we are,” said Rabbi Jacobs of the Reform movement. “The assumptions and mistaken understandings of what world Jewry are about are legion.”The fight over equitable access to the Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, is in a sense a fight over real estate. Popular images of Jewish men worshiping at the wall in prayer shawls and phylacteries show only a small stretch of the ancient retaining wall for the Temple Mount. A large section of that plaza is reserved for men, a smaller one for women.Some distance to the south is Robinson’s Arch, an area of the wall designated in 2003 to host egalitarian prayer services. Yet the limitations of that setting — on a temporary platform, down a lengthy staircase from the main plaza, surrounded by fences and other obstructions, and accessible through an isolated gate — have upset Reform and Conservative Jewish leaders.Their complaints appeared to be satisfied in January 2016, when after years of negotiations Mr. Netanyahu’s government approved a compromise that would create an improved egalitarian prayer space, along with a joint entrance to all the Western Wall prayer areas. Reform and Conservative Jews were to be given a stake in a committee overseeing the complex’s management. All told, the agreement would give non-Orthodox worshipers, at least to a degree, the feeling of equal status.Nearly a year and a half went by without its being adopted, however. And in June, just as the Jewish Agency was meeting in Jerusalem, Mr. Netanyahu bowed to fierce pressure from his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners and announced he was suspending the agreement.In a meeting at Robinson’s Arch on Monday, Tzachi Hanegbi, a minister without portfolio in Mr. Netanyahu’s government, assured leaders of the Jewish Agency that plans were continuing to improve the prayer space, and he said that management of it would be entrusted to the Israel Antiquities Authority, which he said could be trusted to treat all branches of Judaism fairly.“It’s true that the entrance is not going to be equal,” Mr. Hanegbi added, acknowledging a key grievance arising from Mr. Netanyahu’s reversal, and then minimizing it: “But I don’t think that the Jewish people for 3,500 years prayed for an entrance.”Mr. Hanegbi was frank about the political challenges facing Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition, which he said had been in danger of collapse in June over the Western Wall deal. When he suggested more negotiations, one of the visiting officials asked him what guarantee there was that even a renegotiated deal would ever be carried out.“Nothing,” he replied. “That’s the truth.”Mr. Hanegbi gamely hung around long enough for Jewish Agency representatives to try their hand at the new mission of educating Israelis about the concerns of diaspora Jews. Shoshana Dweck, an executive with the Association of Reform Zionists of America, urged him to consider how demeaning it felt to be relegated to second-class citizenship.“It was never about a seat at a lunch counter, or a seat on the bus,” she said in a scolding near-whisper.Mr. Sharansky’s organization and its diverse membership see other threats on the near horizon, not least the bill to tighten ultra-Orthodox control over conversions to Judaism in Israel. Mr. Netanyahu delayed a vote on the conversion bill for six months, but that means it could come up for final passage in December.All of which leaves people like Rabbi Jacobs in something of a hurry.“We’re geared up and ready to fight a long and important battle,” he said late on Monday. “It’s a battle that’s for the soul of Israel.”', 'Israel Horovitz Plays Canceled After Sexual Misconduct Accusations - The New York Times', '', 'MAALE ADUMIM, West Bank – Israel\'s prime minister has pledged to build thousands of new housing units in the West Bank\'s biggest Jewish settlement and annex it to Israel.Benjamin Netanyahu spoke during a visit on Tuesday to Maale Adumim, where he promised "enhanced development" of the settlement.Netanyahu gave no specifics or a timetable, which suggests he may have been playing to his nationalistic base.Israel captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 war and has since built dozens of settlements there.The Palestinians, along with much of the international community, view the settlements as illegal and an obstacle to peace.

He told Channel 10 TV that his clan comprises about 40 percent of the village.He said it is "a dark day" for the Druze community both in Israel and Syria. He said 15 people were killed and 45 wounded, including civilians, in the attack on Hadar Friday.Syrian state news agency SANA had earlier reported that least six people were killed and 21 wounded in the attack, while the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at seven and said 23 people were wounded.An Israeli man from a Druze area in Israel was lightly wounded by stray fire from across the border amid "intense fighting" in Syria, earlier in the day, the military said.Later, it said dozens of Druze marched to the frontier with Syria and tried to breach the security fence. The military said forces brought back some who managed to cross over.The Druze in Israel are part of the country\'s Arab minority. They are full citizens of Israel and generally serve in the army. They also have a large community in Syria with many loyal to the Syrian government.Israel has mostly stayed out of Syria\'s civil war that\'s raging near its northern border, but is believed to have carried out airstrikes on suspected weapons convoys from Syria to its archenemy Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite militant group which has members fighting alongside Syrian government forces.

The money will be earmarked to help finance the political and social infrastructure needed to build a functioning democratic state.U.N.: WORST MALNUTRITION SINCE WAR IS IN BESIEGED SYRIA SUBURBSpeaking on background, a U.S. official told Fox News that while the U.S. will continue its support for Palestinian economic development, there were some reservations.“We are deeply troubled by the framework’s undue focus on Israel. We intend to raise our concerns with the appropriate U.N. offices.”The official added, “We are disappointed that the U.N. Country Team intends to dedicate $18 million of resources over the next five years to projects that could be misused to politicize international legal venues. This is yet another example of the inherent anti-Israel bias in the U.N. system. We hope that this does not accurately reflect the scope and intent of the U.N. projects the document purports to correlate.”The document, which is signed by some 21 U.N. agencies and programs, states that it will put “the Palestinian people at the center of its development programming and advocacy,” and includes everything from health care to education to promoting Palestinian cultural heritage and tourism.U.N.

This includes promoting democratic governance, improving healthcare, increasing employment opportunities and making people aware of their internationally recognized rights. We do this all over the world.”Critics point to several parts of the framework document with one section stating: “The UN will increase its support for Palestinian institutions (state and non-government) and Palestinian victims of violations to effectively monitor, advocate and seek legal recourse for violations by the occupying power."Also stated in the document is this reference to legal accountability: “This will include training, capacity-building and technical advice to ensure that Palestinian victims and institutions are equipped with the knowledge and tools to effectively access international accountability mechanisms in order to hold Israel accountable for its violations under international law.”(The Associated Press)Republican lawmaker Ron DeSantis of Florida, a member of the House Foreign Affairs committee also expressed his concerns.“The United Nations has demonstrated time and again that it is pathologically anti-Israel and this so-called framework is yet another example.

So it was a significant moment when Hamas formally handed control to the authority at a morning ceremony at the Rafah passenger crossing on the Egyptian border.The Palestinian and Egyptian national anthems were played. The crossing was festooned with large portraits of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, who has not set foot in Gaza since Hamas took over there after routing his forces in 2007.The Palestinian Authority is internationally recognized whereas Hamas, the Islamic militant group, is classified as a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and much of the West. With Palestinian Authority oversight of the border crossings, Gaza’s two million residents are now hoping for a significant easing of the blockade that Israel and Egypt imposed citing security concerns, severely restricting the movement of people and goods.In an immediate sign of relief, the Palestinian Authority announced that it was canceling the collection of what it called “illegal” taxes and fees from Gazans, a reference to the unofficial levies of millions of dollars a month that Hamas has been skimming from cross-border imports and smuggling networks.Under the deal between the Palestinian rival factions, signed in October and brokered by Egypt, Hamas agreed to hand over day-to-day governing of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority as well as transfer control of the crossings. Effectively, the agreement was an acknowledgment by Hamas, which has fought Israel three times, that it cannot govern Gaza without its rival.The next steps in the deal are supposed to be a meeting this month in Cairo of all Palestinian factions, and talks aimed at a unity government.But the agreement still leaves major issues unresolved. Chief among them is the fate of the formidable arsenal of rockets and fortified tunnels belonging to Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza, along with tens of thousands of fighters.The Rafah crossing, which has opened only intermittently and for a few days at a time in recent years, is scheduled to become fully operational on Nov. 15, after Egypt finishes renovations on its side of the border. The Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings along the border with Israel, used mainly for humanitarian purposes, are expected to keep running.“Opening the Rafah crossing is the biggest accomplishment for the Palestinian people and a historic gain,” said Fares Nasr, 60, an unemployed bus driver in Gaza City.He said he has been unable to get to Egypt for medical treatment, and his daughter, who lives in Dubai, has been unable to visit Gaza and see her two sons studying at university there for five years.Abu Khaled Hamdan, 60, another Gaza City resident, said he used to bring his son, who was studying engineering in Egypt, back for visits through a tunnel at a cost of $200 a trip.The celebrations were tempered by a flare-up along the border with Israel this week, underscoring the fragility of the reconciliation. On Monday, Israel bombed what it said was an offensive tunnel belonging to Islamic Jihad that ran beneath the border fence into Israel. Israel said the bombing took place on its side of the fence, and the military said it was intended to disable the tunnel, not to kill senior militants.Still, it turned into the deadliest cross-border event since the Gaza war of 2014. Five Islamic Jihad militants died, including two senior commanders. Two Hamas militants were also killed while carrying out what the group called a rescue mission.Islamic Jihad is not a party to the reconciliation deal and the episode threatened to derail the fledgling unity accord. At least a half-dozen previous efforts at reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah, Mr. Abbas’s mainstream party, have failed.But under pressure from Egypt, the groups did not immediately retaliate, allowing the ceremonies at the crossings to go ahead even as the search continued for more bodies.Khaled al-Batsh, the leader of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, said after the attack, “Israel has tried to impose a new equation on the resistance, whereby Israel is allowed to kill, assassinate and raid whenever it wants.” Speaking at the hospital that was treating the wounded, he added, “We need to prevent it from doing so.”Nonetheless, the Palestinian Authority prime minister, Rami Hamdallah, celebrated Wednesday’s events, saying his government’s assumption of responsibility at the crossings was “a pivotal step to empower the government and realize our national unity.”The United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay Mladenov, hailed it as a “landmark development” that “should facilitate the lifting of the closures, while addressing Israel’s legitimate security concerns, and unlock increased international support for Gaza’s reconstruction, growth, stability and prosperity.”Israel, which has expressed strong reservations about any reconciliation deal that does not disarm Hamas, responded more cautiously. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, who leads Cogat, the Israeli government agency that coordinates with the Palestinian Authority on civil matters, instructed his staff to meet with Palestinian counterparts to work out joint work and security procedures at the crossings.General Mordechai said Israel would insist on there being no Hamas personnel, or anyone working on the group’s behalf, involved in operating the crossings or in the vicinity of the crossings, according to a statement from his office.Hamas seems determined to shed the burden of governing Gaza, but without accepting the Palestinian-Israeli agreements of the 1990s that gave rise to the Palestinian Authority, or forfeiting what it calls its “weapons of resistance” against Israel.“The division is behind us,” Ismail Haniya, the leader of Hamas, said in a speech in Gaza on Wednesday, “and the reconciliation decision is irreversible.” He added, “We have completed the first stage of the reconciliation. Hamas has its own strategy for not recognizing Israel.”Illustrating the deep and abiding differences between the rival Palestinian factions, Hamas accused Israel of crimes in the aftermath of the tunnel bombing and said Israel was deliberately trying to foil the reconciliation effort. Mr. Haniya also called on the Palestinian Authority to stop its security cooperation with Israel, a bedrock of the agreements between the two, which he described as a “flaw.”', 'U.S. Works to Keep Palestinians’ Talks on Track to Aid Peace - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — With Egypt brokering a reconciliation between the two rival Palestinian factions, President Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East visited Cairo on Thursday to help move those talks along while trying to ensure that the Egyptians do not take them in a direction unacceptable to the United States and Israel.Hamas, the militant Islamic group that seized power in the Gaza Strip in 2007 and has run it ever since, agreed in Cairo last week to return administrative control of the impoverished coastal territory to the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas.The Oct. 12 agreement calls for the Palestinian Authority to lift sanctions that it imposed on Gaza this year to pressure Hamas by cutting electricity supplies to a few hours a day and slashing payment of government salaries. Hamas, in turn, is to give the authority control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, opening up a critical lifeline for imports and for outside travel.But the pact was really an agreement to start talking: The more troublesome issues between Hamas and Mr. Abbas’s Fatah faction — including the merger of two separate work forces in Gaza, and what is to become of the estimated 25,000 Hamas fighters, their arsenal of rockets and network of tunnels — were left for later.For the Trump administration, which has hopes of achieving a grand Israeli-Palestinian bargain, Egypt’s efforts with Hamas and Fatah provided a potentially crucial opening to solve the problem of Gaza, which many see as a prerequisite to reviving the peace process.A key question is whether the talks in Cairo will give Hamas, which the United States designates as a terrorist organization, influence over a consolidated Palestinian government of both the West Bank and Gaza Strip — and how much.The United States envoy, Jason D. Greenblatt, warned before his one-day trip to Cairo that any Palestinian government “must unambiguously and explicitly commit” to nonviolence, peaceful negotiations, recognition of the State of Israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations — including those that would disarm terrorists.“If Hamas is to play any role in a Palestinian government, it must accept these basic requirements,” Mr. Greenblatt said.Israel and the United States would both welcome Mr. Abbas’s regaining control of Gaza, if only to avert what aid groups and the United Nations had called an emerging humanitarian and health crisis, as disease spread and the pumping of raw sewage into the Mediterranean began to disrupt water plants along Israel’s own coast.For Egypt, the motivation for brokering the talks goes well beyond the good will derived from diplomacy. The Egyptians are eager to secure the Rafah border as part of a broader effort to halt weapons smuggling into Sinai, where they are fighting an Islamic State affiliate.But while a rapprochement between Hamas and Mr. Abbas’s Fatah faction, which dominates the Palestinian Authority, poses the tantalizing prospect of a united Palestinian front facing Israel in potential peace talks, a unity government involving Hamas could violate congressional rules against funding terrorist organizations. That, in turn, could cause the Trump administration to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in annual aid to the Palestinians. A similar deal between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in 2011 prompted threatened funding cuts.Speaking at a ceremony marking 100 years since the death of a Zionist heroine, the Jewish spy Sarah Aaronsohn, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel commended Mr. Greenblatt’s statement. “We want peace,” he said. “We want a genuine peace, and because of this we will not conduct negotiations with a terrorist organization in diplomatic disguise.”Notably, Israeli statements on the Palestinian reconciliation effort, including Mr. Netanyahu’s latest, appear to leave narrow but perceptible wiggle room for reaching an accommodation.Mr. Netanyahu’s vow not to “conduct negotiations with a terrorist organization” ignored that Israel had done precisely that a quarter century ago. In 1993, Israel reached a historic agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel had long considered a terrorist group, and which, unlike the Palestinian Authority, remains its official negotiating partner.Under the reconciliation effort, the Palestinian Authority’s ministers who are resuming their functions in Gaza are technocrats who were installed as part of a 2014 national consensus government, to which Israel and the United States do not object, given that the ministers include no Hamas members.This time around, Hamas has so far refused to consider disarming its fighters and has insisted that it remains dedicated to liberating Palestine, not embracing Mr. Abbas’s project of a two-state solution — despite a new document of principles it released in the spring that accepted the idea of a provisional Palestinian state, without renouncing future claims to the land that is now Israel.Yehya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, sounded a typically fierce note on Thursday: “The time has passed when Hamas is discussing the issue of recognizing Israel,” he told a group of Gaza youths, according to the Hamas-affiliated Shehab News Agency’s Arabic-language Facebook page. “Now the debate is over when we wipe out Israel.”“No one can disarm us,” he added.Still, Mr. Greenblatt’s presence in Egypt on Thursday suggested that the United States sees the Fatah-Hamas talks as a chance, however slim, to at least move Hamas in the direction of disarming and embracing the peace process.The militant stance by Hamas leaders poses a problem not only for Israel and the United States, but also for Mr. Abbas, who has vowed not to let Gaza morph into a Lebanon-like situation, where, like Hezbollah, Hamas’s heavily armed fighters wield the ultimate veto power over an enfeebled civilian government that bears responsibility for the difficult work of delivering public services.', 'JERUSALEM – When the world\'s cycling elite converge on Israel next year for the storied Giro d\'Italia race, they will grapple with the rugged hills of Jerusalem, speed by the shimmering Mediterranean Sea and huff their way through the moonscape of the southern Negev Desert.But one place the riders will skip is the crown jewel of the local tourism industry, Jerusalem\'s ancient Old City.Under a longstanding tradition, the annual multi-stage race has had some starts and stages take place outside of Italy. In a public relations coup for Israel, the 2018 event here will be the first time the race has taken place outside of Europe. The Giro is to start in Jerusalem and include two additional stages in Israel.Race organizers said the route will not go through any land considered occupied by the international community. That means the course will circumvent the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war and claimed by the Palestinians as parts of a future independent state.Race director Mauro Vegni said he was aware of the political sensitivities and had drawn up the course with the "guidance" of the Italian Foreign Ministry."The reality is that we want it to be a sports event and stay away from any political discussion," Vegni told The Associated Press.Avoiding politics, however, is difficult when dealing with Jerusalem. Israel considers east Jerusalem an inseparable part of its capital, while the Palestinians claim the area as their capital. The conflicting and emotional claims to east Jerusalem, home to the city\'s most sensitive holy sites, lie at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and often complicate what might be routine events in other locales.Foreign dignitaries rarely enter east Jerusalem, and when they do visit, such as President Donald Trump\'s trip to the Old City last May, it is usually done privately.In the case of the Giro, the opening stage in Jerusalem will carefully avoid the city\'s invisible pre-1967 boundaries.Riders will be able to glimpse the ancient walls of the Old City, but they will not enter it or any Palestinian neighborhoods. Other stages are planned along the Mediterranean coast, and in the Red Sea resort of Eilat.The Italian Foreign Ministry confirmed it had helped Italian race organizers "get a better understanding of the broader political context" and make sure the "routes are inside the pre-1967 borders."The Giro is one of cycling\'s prestigious Grand Tour races, along with the Tour de France and the Spanish Vuelta. The race in Israel will mark the first time that any of the Grand Tour events is held outside of Europe.It\'s an achievement for Giro organizer RCS Sport to go beyond the continent ahead of rival ASO, which organizes the Tour and the Vuelta. Giro organizers declined to say how much their Israeli partners had paid to bring the race to Israel.Israeli leaders and local race officials said they are thrilled to host the Giro, labeling it as the biggest and most prestigious sporting event ever held in Israel. They expect tens of thousands of tourists and cycling enthusiasts."We understand that not everyone agrees with us," said Israel\'s minister for strategic affairs, Gilad Erdan, who oversees the country\'s efforts to counter an international pro-Palestinian boycott movement of the Jewish state.Erdan said the fact the Giro is coming to Israel "is a huge achievement in and of itself that strengthens Israel\'s legitimacy."The Sports Ministry, whose minister, Miri Regev, is so passionate about Jerusalem that she wore a dress decorated with the walls of the Old City to the Cannes Film Festival this year, called the race a symbol of "peace and unity." The ministry said the Giro would promote Israel\'s history, heritage, "magical views" and holy sites.That does not mean the race organizers can just coast to the finish line. The Palestinians and their allies in the boycott movement have objected to promotional materials on the Giro\'s social media that include photos and videos of the Old City of Jerusalem.A photo on the Giro\'s Twitter account shows the Spanish cycling great Alberto Contador with Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barket in front of the Old City, and a video on Facebook shows footage of the Western Wall and other sites inside the Old City.The Palestinian ambassador in Rome, May Kaileh, said her embassy is putting pressure on the race to remove the photos.The Palestinian sports minister, Jibril Rajoub, called the photographs an "issue of misunderstanding" and said he hopes they will be removed. "The most important thing for us, the race is not entering the 1967 boundaries, including east Jerusalem," he said.However, Omar Barghouti, Palestinian co-founder of the anti-Israel boycott movement, called on the Giro to cancel the Israel stages altogether and move the race elsewhere.Promotional material that "deceptively" portrays east Jerusalem as part of Israel, and working with an Israeli partner that does business in West Bank settlements, amount to "shameful complicity" with Israeli rights violations, he said.Barghouti also promised pro-Palestinian demonstrations if the race takes place in Israel."Civil society organizations in Palestine, Italy and throughout Europe are mobilizing to convince participating teams, sponsors and cycling federations to pressure Giro d\'Italia to relocate the race," he said. "Giro d\'Italia can expect nonviolent, lively protests if it insists on whitewashing Israel\'s occupation and apartheid."Vegni, the Giro director, rejected the criticism."I hope that it\'s treated as a sports event. And I hope it\'s treated as a sports event by the Palestinians also," he said.___Dampf reported from Rome. Associated Press writers Mohammed Daraghmeh in Ramallah, West Bank, and Aron Heller in Jerusalem contributed to this report.', 'The Israeli military said on Monday that it struck and destroyed an anti-aircraft battery deep in Syria after it had opened fire on Israeli jets flying over Lebanon -- the first such incident of Syrian forces targeting Israeli planes since the civil war began in 2011. Military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said Israeli planes were on a routine reconnaissance mission near the Lebanese-Syrian border when they came under fire. They were not hit and returned to base safely. In response, Israel hit a Syrian anti-aircraft battery about 30 miles east of Damascus and "incapacitated" it, he said. Russian forces in Syria were notified in real time, Conricus said, adding that Israel holds Syria responsible for any attack from its territory. Israel has largely stayed out of the fighting in Syria but it has carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged arms shipments bound for Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. It has also occasionally carried out limited reprisals along its frontier with Syria in the Golan Heights, after spillover of Syria\'s fighting. But such a strike deep in Syrian territory is highly unusual. Conricus said Israel has no interest in destabilizing the situation but says the military will "preserve our ability to act and thwart" any hostile activity against it.', '', 'JERUSALEM – Overshadowed by last week\'s showdown between the U.S. and North Korea, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas issued an ominous warning in his address to the United Nations: With hopes running out for an independent Palestinian state, the Palestinian leader said he may have no choice but to seek a single, binational state with Israel.While Abbas appears to be in no hurry to disband his self-rule government, his threat raises an awkward scenario for Israel and the Trump administration that could potentially spell doom for the century-old Zionist enterprise.Abbas was a mastermind and negotiator of the historic Oslo peace accords of the 1990s — interim deals that set a five-year goal for reaching a final agreement. Since then, he has remained a vocal supporter of pursuing a negotiated peace agreement that would establish an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.But after nearly a quarter century of failed U.S.-led peace efforts, the 82-year-old Abbas told the world body last Wednesday that time is running out as Israel expands its settlements on occupied lands."The two-state solution is today in jeopardy," he said, saying that the Palestinians will have to "look for alternatives" if the door is closed to independence."If the two-state solution were to be destroyed due to the creation of a one-state reality with two systems — apartheid," he said, "this would be a failure, and neither you, nor we, will have any other choice but to continue the struggle and demand full, equal rights for all inhabitants of historic Palestine."Abbas has issued similar threats before. But the timing and high-profile venue of his speech gave his comments some added urgency. The Palestinians are eagerly waiting for President Donald Trump to present his vision for peace, and are desperately seeking his endorsement of a two-state solution."President Abbas sent a direct message to the U.S. administration, saying: Either you save the two-state solution or we are going to end up in one state where our people are going to ask for full rights," said Mohammed Ishtayeh, a top adviser to Abbas.A White House official said the administration understands the difficulties involved, but remains optimistic and is having "productive conversations with both sides." The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing behind-the-scenes diplomacy.The Palestinians seek the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip — territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war — for their future state. The international community, including Trump\'s predecessors, has long supported the two-state solution, believing that partitioning the land into Israeli and Palestinian states is the best way to ensure peace.The reasoning is rooted in demographics. Most demographers believe the number of Jews and Arabs in these areas is close to equal. Relinquishing control of territories with several million Palestinians would ensure Israel\'s future as a democracy with a solid Jewish majority. Continued control over the Palestinians, on the other hand, could force Israel to choose between its Jewish character and remaining a democracy.With this in mind, Israel withdrew from Gaza, now home to 2 million Palestinians, in 2005. Yet it also has strengthened its grip on the West Bank and east Jerusalem, together home to over 600,000 Israelis and an estimated 2.7 million Palestinians, making any future separation increasingly difficult. Israel has some 1.8 million Arab citizens and 6.5 million Jews, according to its Central Bureau of Statistics.Israel has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the area, home to sensitive religious sites, an inseparable part of its capital. Although the annexation is not internationally recognized, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed never to divide the city.The fate of the West Bank is even more complicated. Israel has established scores of settlements without declaring it to be part of Israel. The result is a complicated reality where Israeli settlers enjoy the protection of the Israeli military and the rights of Israeli citizenship, while Palestinians are subject to a combination of autonomy under Abbas\' Palestinian Authority and Israeli military law. Critics, including Abbas, frequently compare this two-tiered system to South African apartheid.Israeli hard-liners have offered a host of reasons to oppose Palestinian independence. They claim Israel\'s pre-1967 boundaries would be indefensible, point to past peace proposals rejected by the Palestinians and note the bloody second Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s and Hamas takeover of Gaza in 2007. They cite the Jewish biblical connection to the West Bank, say that expanded Palestinian autonomy should be sufficient or claim that Abbas is weak or cannot be trusted.But they have struggled to provide an answer if the Palestinians give up their aspirations for independence and instead seek equality and Israeli voting rights. Coping with this dilemma, Netanyahu offered conditional support for Palestinian independence upon taking office in 2009. But since Trump\'s election, Netanyahu has stopped talking about a two-state solution.Netanyahu\'s office did not respond to requests for comment on Abbas\' speech. His U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, last week said Abbas had "spread falsehoods.""Today\'s lies and excuses have proven once again that the Palestinian leadership is a serial evader of peace," he said.It seems unlikely that Abbas will follow through on his warning. The Palestinian president controls a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, tens of thousands of jobs and travels the world with VIP status. His aides admit there are no immediate plans to disband the internationally backed Palestinian Authority.Palestinian officials say his speech was meant to rouse an international community that has stopped paying attention to them and to remind the world that the alternatives to inaction are worse."We told the Americans it\'s the last chance for the two-state solution," Ishtayeh said.', 'Trusted Netanyahu Adviser Caught Up in Corruption Inquiry - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — The corruption investigations closing in on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel had caught up his wife, his personal lawyer, a former chief of staff and other close confidants — nearly all of them, it seemed, save one: Yitzhak Molho, the lifelong friend Mr. Netanyahu has relied upon to negotiate with the Palestinians, sent on secret diplomatic missions and turned to on sensitive matters since the 1990s.So much for that.The police confirmed on Tuesday that Mr. Molho, the 72-year-old managing partner of one of Jerusalem’s leading law firms and chairman of the Israel Museum, had been detained for questioning in perhaps the weightiest of the investigations underway: an expanding inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the multibillion-dollar purchase of three new submarines from a German shipbuilding company. Israeli news reports, citing unnamed sources, said Mr. Molho was suspected of a conflict of interest and breach of trust.To some who have negotiated with him, Mr. Molho’s interrogation, disclosed after the expiration of a 48-hour court-imposed gag order, was baffling. “Hard to fathom,” Dennis B. Ross, the former United States Middle East envoy, wrote in an email. Saying he had worked closely with Mr. Molho for 20 years and found him “careful and meticulous and always ethical,” Mr. Ross added: “I doubt there is anything that actually touches him.”But to critics of Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Molho’s detention on Sunday along with that of David Shimron, a partner in his law firm who previously had been named as a suspect in the submarine investigation, highlighted a glaring, longstanding problem in the way the prime minister has run his government: The two men were perhaps his most trusted advisers, yet neither had given up private law practice — leading, at a minimum, to the appearance of a conflict of interest.Personal interests are inextricable when it comes to Mr. Molho, Mr. Shimron and Mr. Netanyahu: Mr. Shimron, who has helped Mr. Netanyahu negotiate to form a governing coalition, is a cousin of the prime minister’s. Mr. Molho is married to Mr. Shimron’s sister.But the concentration of so much power in the hands of two men, and one law firm, “had immense financial significance,” Nahum Barnea, a leading Israeli columnist, wrote Tuesday.“Ministers felt it necessary to do their bidding, directors general considered every request of theirs as coming from the prime minister, business tycoons sought them out,” he wrote. “The state’s most sensitive matters, Likud matters, family matters and business interests related to the government, were conducted by one law firm.”Most immediately, the questioning of Mr. Molho — a publicity-averse, urbane eminence for whom leak-proof discretion has been a calling card — added to the image of Mr. Netanyahu as embattled, with few untainted advisers left, weakening poll numbers and opponents campaigning openly to succeed him, often by citing the investigations whipping through his inner circle.“If he’s not responsible, then he’s a bad manager,” said Avi Gabbay, the Labor Party’s chairman and candidate for prime minister.“For sure, it’s right that the prime minister will take people that he trusts, but to put them in such delicate areas and issues while they have their private interests, while they represent the business sector?” Mr. Gabbay, himself a former chief executive of Bezeq, Israel’s largest telecommunications company, said in an interview. “It’s impossible. It cannot be.”Mr. Netanyahu has not been named as a suspect in the submarine case.For Mr. Shimron, who has long served as Mr. Netanyahu’s lawyer on personal matters, his entanglement in the submarine case stems from his representation of Michael Ganor, the Israeli agent for the German shipbuilder, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. The same company also won a no-bid contract to build missile ships to protect Israel’s offshore gas drilling platforms after a competitive international bidding process was abruptly canceled. Mr. Ganor has since become a state witness.It was unclear exactly what information the police sought from Mr. Molho. In a statement, Zvi Agnon, a lawyer for Mr. Molho, said that in his many years as an envoy Mr. Molho had never acted for personal gain, only for the good of the country, and that he had no connection to the submarine case.But Mr. Molho’s name had surfaced in connection with the submarine purchase at least once before, over the summer, after it was reported that ThyssenKrupp had contracted to sell similar vessels to Egypt, despite a longstanding Israeli policy to demand exclusivity for its weapons systems in the Middle East.According to the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, when the former defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, inquired why Germany had failed to honor the terms of its exclusivity agreement with Israel, the Germans said that an agreement had been reached with Mr. Molho, acting on Mr. Netanyahu’s behalf.This is not Mr. Molho’s first run-in with accusations of conflict of interest. In 2013, he quit Mr. Netanyahu’s negotiating team in talks to form a governing coalition after Israel’s attorney general ruled he could not continue at the same time to represent Mr. Netanyahu in peace talks with the Palestinians.Mr. Molho actually resigned as a special envoy last month, in the face of a petition calling on him to suspend himself because of his ties to Mr. Shimron. He delayed his exit until February at Mr. Netanyahu’s request. But Mr. Molho’s questioning by the police raises doubts about whether he would be able to stay on any longer.As a negotiator with the Palestinians, Mr. Molho was considered likable and forthright, but highly focused on details — to the point that some of his United States counterparts called him “Dr. No” during the talks led by Secretary of State John Kerry during the Obama administration. Others said Mr. Molho was just serving as a good lawyer for a client, Mr. Netanyahu, who was not eager for a far-reaching commitment.For now, with the investigation sidelining his most trusted aides, Mr. Netanyahu could find himself at a disadvantage, analysts said.“It won’t be easy for him to right his ship when Molho and Shimron are not there to help him,” Mr. Barnea, the columnist, said. “They were the pillars of his royal court.”', '', 'JERUSALEM – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris in early December to discuss threats against Israel from Hezbollah and Iran and "ideas to stabilize the situation in Lebanon."The prime minister told his Likud party at a meeting Monday that he spoke with the French president "at length" the previous day.Lebanon was plunged into crisis earlier this month by the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri, a Hezbollah rival. Hariri recently traveled to France from Saudi Arabia, where he had made the announcement.Netanyahu says he and Macron agreed to meet to "see if we can adopt similar approaches, as much as possible, concerning this threat and the nuclear agreement with Iran."', 'Expecting a Hero’s Welcome, Lebanese Director Was Accused of Treason - The New York TimesBEIRUT, Lebanon — It was supposed to be a glorious homecoming.After achieving acclaim abroad for his previous films, Ziad Doueiri, a Lebanese director, thought he was returning to Beirut this month to celebrate the debut of his newest movie, “The Insult.”Instead, he was detained at the airport and summoned before a military court the next day to answer accusations of treason. His crime: He had shot his previous movie in Israel, which Lebanon considers an enemy state and bars its citizens from visiting.Why he was stopped on this visit was anyone’s guess, since he had been to Lebanon more than a dozen times in the five years since that previous film was released. The government had even chosen his new film to represent Lebanon at the Academy Awards.He was released without charge after a few hours of questioning, but what has become known here as “the Ziad Doueiri affair” has fueled fierce debates about law, politics, artistic freedom and Lebanon’s hostile relationship with its southern neighbor.Mr. Doueiri’s critics accuse him of normalizing the enemy to elevate his international profile. Mr. Doueiri says that he had to shoot in Israel to tell his film’s story accurately, and that the backlash has surprised him.“I don’t mind at all being attacked ideologically or for a movie,” he said in an interview after his release. “Let them criticize the movie. But to accuse someone of being a traitor — of treason — is big.”Throughout his career, Mr. Doueiri, 53, has made films about the complexities of Middle Eastern identity and about personal histories shaped by the region’s conflicts.His first film, “West Beirut,” followed three adolescents — two Muslim boys and a Christian girl — at the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war in 1975. “The Insult” tracks a street conflict between a Christian and a Palestinian that escalates into a reckoning of the civil war’s legacy. It is scheduled to open in the United States in January.Mr. Doueiri, an energetic, fast-talking man with salt-and-pepper curls that tumble over his ears and eyes, said his own life had left him attuned to how people’s backgrounds could shape their perception of reality. As a secular Muslim director who studied in California, married a Christian and now lives in Paris, he feels that delving into such complexities makes better characters.“Dramatically speaking for filmmaking, it’s much more interesting to be nuanced,” he said. “Even Darth Vader has a good side, otherwise he wouldn’t be interesting.”But he says he knew it was risky to go to Israel, which he said Lebanon considered “the ultimate Darth Vader.”Indeed, history has left many Lebanese with a deep hatred of the Jewish state.Its creation in 1948 sent waves of Palestinian refugees across the border into refugee camps that evolved into permanent settlements. Israel also occupied southern Lebanon for nearly two decades, backed factions in Lebanon’s civil war and fought a 34-day war with Hezbollah in 2006 that killed hundreds of people.The animosity has led to laws forbidding Lebanese citizens from traveling to Israel and from associating with Israelis, although the authorities often look the other way when Lebanese with second passports make quiet visits. (Mr. Doueiri traveled to Israel on his American passport.)The ban on engagement with Israel often creates effects in Lebanon’s cultural realm.The government has banned Israeli films, like the 2008 movie “Waltz With Bashir,” an animated autobiographical drama about the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. This year, it banned “Wonder Woman” because its star, Gal Gadot, had been an Israeli soldier.In that light, many Lebanese saw an extended trip to Israel by one of the country’s most prominent filmmakers, a trip that involved paying Israeli actors and crew, as a step too far.“We are in a war with Israel, and when you are in a war, you can’t deal with them like a neighboring country,” said Pierre Abi-Saab, deputy editor in chief of Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar newspaper, which has led the criticism of Mr. Doueiri. “So when a filmmaker goes, an intellectual, and says, ‘Brother, we are with peace’ — what peace? Whose peace?”Mr. Doueiri made his trip to film “The Attack,” which tells the story of an Arab-Israeli surgeon whose wife becomes a suicide bomber, leaving him struggling to figure out what happened.Even though the film was shot in Israel, Lebanon’s censorship office approved it for showing in cinemas in 2012. But after lobbying by anti-Israeli activists, the Arab League asked its 22 members to boycott the film. Most did, including Lebanon.Mr. Doueiri, too, was attacked.“They said, ‘Ziad the Zionist. Ziad the Israeli,’ ” he said. “In Lebanon, in the Arab world, you take that label and glue it to your name and you are screwed for a long time.”But he returned to Lebanon repeatedly and spent most of 2016 in the country to shoot “The Insult,” with help from the police, the military and the courts — all without any legal problems.As the new film’s release approached, his foes spoke up.Mr. Abi-Saab, the newspaper editor, wrote an article calling on Mr. Doueiri to apologize for the “moral, political and national crime” of working in Israel. If he did not, Mr. Abi-Saab wrote, the movie should be not be screened in Lebanon and Mr. Doueiri should be considered “wanted” by the authorities.In an interview, Mr. Abi-Saab said he considered Mr. Doueiri a talented director. But he said he opposed all engagement with Israel and saw the film as part of an effort to normalize Israel and make the Lebanese people stop seeing it as an enemy.“Unfortunately, that naïve, romantic talk about ‘the other’ and ‘I want to understand the other and make peace’ — you can’t make peace with someone who has put a knife to your neck,” he said. “It’s impossible.”Mr. Doueiri never apologized, and the judge who had summoned him threw out the case, citing the statute of limitations and saying that the film had not defamed Lebanon or the Palestinian cause, Mr. Doueiri said.Mr. Doueiri said he had not intended to make a pro- or anti-Israel film, but to tell a complicated human story.He was born in Beirut to secular Muslim parents, and his adolescence was dominated by the civil war, which raged until 1990. His left-wing family supported the Palestinians, which meant that he hated the Israelis and their Lebanese Christian allies.“To me, a good Christian was a dead Christian,” he recalled.In 1983, he moved to the United States to go to film school at San Diego State University, where, far from Lebanon, he met Jews and Lebanese Christians it would have been hard for him to get to know at home, he said.He also worked as a cameraman on American films, including Quentin Tarantino’s “Reservoir Dogs” and “Pulp Fiction.”After making “West Beirut,” in 1998, Mr. Doueiri fell in love with a Lebanese Christian woman, Joelle Touma. They were from communities that had hated each other during the war, so the relationship itself was an exercise in learning to see another perspective.“We grew up in opposite camps in the war, and each of us made his own arc to go back and look at the other point of view,” Ms. Touma said.They began co-writing scripts, got married, had a daughter and are now divorced, although they still write together, sometimes on the same computer screen, Ms. Touma said.Their different backgrounds informed “The Insult,” a political courtroom drama that looks at the past suffering of Palestinians and Christians in Lebanon, and the scars that remain.They wrote it during their divorce, which probably fueled the contentious court scenes, Ms. Touma said.Mr. Doueiri’s hope for the film, besides that it makes its money back, is that it encourages Lebanese to look back and be more open about their painful histories as a step toward reconciliation.“It would be nice if people think a little bit about what they have wanted to say but they didn’t dare,” he said.', 'Tehran shows off its Khorramshahr missile, a weapon can carry multiple warheads and has the range to strike Israel; correspondent John Huddy reportsIran’s Revolutionary Guard unveiled the country\'s newest ballistic missile Friday during a military parade in Tehran, showcasing a rocket with the reported range to reach most of the Middle East -- including Israel.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani vowed Tehran would continue with its missile program in defiance of U.S. demands to the contrary.Rocket can reportedly reach IsraelThe unveiling occurred during a parade held to celebrate the 1980s Iraq-Iran war. Similar parades with Iranian army units and Revolutionary Guard forces were held in other Iranian cities.The move was a direct challenge to President Trump, who in August signed a bill imposing mandatory penalties on those involved in Iran’s ballistic missile program and anyone who does business them.Iran has long bragged of having missiles in its arsenal, however, Friday was the first time Khoramshahr, the name of the newest missile, with a range of 1,250 miles was displayed in public.FRANCE’S MACRON SAYS IRAN NUKE DEAL NOT ENOUGH, DEFENDS IT NONETHELESSNot much is known about Khoramshahr, but the state-run IRNA news agency quoted the chief of the Guard’s airspace division, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, saying the missile “can carry several warheads for various uses.”"As it was observed, the missile has become smaller in size and more tactical and it will be operational in the near future," he told reporters on the sidelines of the parade.Rouhani said at the parade that Tehran would not stop its missile program but instead boost military capabilities, despite U.S. demands.Rouhani also said Tehran would keep supporting the "oppressed people of Yemen, Syria and Palestine" — a reference to Iran\'s role in the wars in Yemen and Syria and its support for Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas.Iran is a close ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad and has backed Yemen’s Shiite rebels against U.S. supported and Saudi-led coalition that sought to return the internationally elected government to power in Yemen.During Trump’s address to the United Nations Tuesday, Trump accused Iran of supporting terrorists and called Tehran a “corrupt dictatorship” and a “murderous regime.”President Trump accused Iran of supporting terrorists during his address Tuesday to the United Nations.(AP)Speaking a day later, Rouhani said the Iranian people are waiting for an apology from Trump for his "extremely offensive" rhetoric and "unfounded" allegations about Iran.TRUMP SHOULD NOT CERTIFY IRAN’S NUCLEAR COMPLIANCE AND HERE’S HOW HE CAN DO ITRouhani afterward told reporters the Trump administration is seeking "an excuse" to pull out of the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement that capped Iran\'s nuclear activities in return for the lifting of international sanctions on Iran.On Thursday, Iran\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all major policies in Iran, said Trump\'s "cheap, ugly, foolish and unreal" remarks before the U.N. General Assembly were a sign of desperation.Later on Friday, Iranians staged anti-Trump protests to show their anger over the U.S. president\'s speech. Thousands of worshipers marched after Friday prayers in Tehran, chanting "Death to America" and "Death to Israel."Similar protests occurred in other Iranian cities.The Associated Press contributed to this report.', '                                    FotografÃ\x83Â\xada de archivo del 17 de octubre de 2016 de oficinas generales de la UNESCO en ParÃ\x83Â\xads.

The United States is pulling out of UNESCO after repeated criticism of resolutions the Trump administration says demonstrate the U.N. cultural agency\'s "anti-Israel bias." The State Department announced the decision on Thursday.Today, US notified @UNESCO Director-General @IrinaBokova of the US decision to withdraw from the organization. https://t.co/JA9WirHMLEUS indicated to Director Gen. @IrinaBokova its desire to remain engaged with @UNESCO as a non-member observer state. https://t.co/JA9WirHMLE"This decision was not taken lightly, and reflects U.S. concerns with mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO,"State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said.The U.S. indicated to UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova the desire to remain engaged with the organization as a non-member observer state "to contribute U.S. views, perspectives and expertise," she said.The withdrawal will take effect on Dec. 31, 2018, and the U.S. will continue to remain a full member of UNESCO until that time.UNESCO is best known for its World Heritage program to protect cultural sites and traditions around the world. The agency also works to improve education for girls in desperately poor countries and in scientific fields, to promote better understanding of the horrors of the Holocaust and to defend media freedom, among other activities.While the U.S. stopped funding UNESCO after it voted to include Palestine as a member in 2011, the State Department has maintained a UNESCO office at its Paris headquarters and sought to weigh in on policy behind the scenes.The U.S. previously pulled out of UNESCO in the 1980s because Washington viewed it as mismanaged and used for political reasons, then rejoined it in 2003.The decision by the Trump administration comes as the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is voting to choose a new director this week, in tense balloting overshadowed by the agency\'s funding troubles and divisions over Palestinian membership.Many saw the vote to include Palestine as evidence of long-running, ingrained anti-Israel bias within the United Nations, where Israel and its allies are far outnumbered by Arab countries and their supporters.The Trump administration has been preparing for a likely withdrawal for months, and a decision was expected before the end of the year, U.S. officials previously told the Associated Press. Several diplomats who were to have been posted to the mission this summer were told that their positions were on hold and advised to seek other jobs.In addition, the Trump administration\'s proposed budget for the next fiscal year contained no provision for the possibility that UNESCO funding restrictions might be lifted.The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'Born in Auschwitz, Israeli Artist, 102, Harnesses the Dark and the Light - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — She painted gray and black flowers, their innate beauty discernible only through hints of light.Her Israeli landscapes are stark and desolate, punctuated by towering cypress trees and heavy rocks. Minimalist still lifes depict a pair of empty chairs. In portraits, family members appear with blurred and vanishing features or faces that fade into geometric patterns because, the artist said, “they are all gone,” murdered in the Holocaust.The artist, Tova Berlinski, was born in 1915 in the Polish town of Oswiecim, better known by its German name — Auschwitz. Newly married, she and her husband left for what was then known as Palestine in 1938, a year before the Germans conquered Oswiecim and began building the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp on the edge of town.Much of her work evokes the loss and pain of a lifetime that spans a century — including the Nazi decimation of European Jewry in World War II and the foundation of modern Israel, which she came to help build and where she made her home.Yet there are also flashes of brightness and color, like an abstract painting from an early period recalling a candy and ice cream store named Posner from her youth in Oswiecim. More recent paintings, including one dated April 2017, around her 102nd birthday, depict bright, vibrant vistas — blue skies, green grass, balcony doors opening onto a rolling desert bathed in the Mediterranean sunlight.“The color returned to me,” Ms. Berlinski said. “Not to my life, but to me. I don’t know why.”It has been more than 20 years since her solo “Black Flowers” exhibition was held at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, one of the peaks of a long career. But this month, Ms. Berlinski, now a widow, is emerging once again into the limelight, with a tribute exhibition and sale of her works at ArtSpace, a small gallery in the leafy neighborhood of German Colony in Jerusalem, where she has lived for more than 50 years.Ms. Berlinski’s 11th-floor apartment, a short walk from the gallery, is ordinarily a quiet place, its walls lined with portraits of her vanished family and her late husband, Eliyahu Berlinski, known as Elec. But one recent weekday, it was abuzz.Linda Zisquit, an American-born poet and the director of ArtSpace, which represents contemporary Israeli artists, was visiting to choose some pieces with the help of Orna Millo, another Israeli artist, who curated Ms. Berlinski’s last solo exhibition, in 2002, at Jerusalem Artists House.Ms. Berlinski’s caretaker, Jenny Borjas, rushed around, helping to arrange the furniture for a photo shoot. (Ms. Borjas may also have had something to do with Ms. Berlinski’s more colorful work of late. She said she had encouraged Ms. Berlinski to return to using reds and a more cheerful palette.)In the catalog for the 2002 exhibition, Ms. Millo wrote, “Tova Berlinski’s paintings are very personal, in the style ‘I only knew how to tell my own story. My world is as narrow as an ant’s world.’ But through her prism, we can feel also the Israeli experience, and the difficulties of our existence in this country.”Describing what she called “My Pictorial Biography,” Ms. Berlinski wrote in the catalog: “Every portrait in the painting of my family tells a different story, but all are close to my heart with a love that time will not eradicate.”Those haunting portraits — of her father, her mother, her brother — hang on the walls of her salon, resonating with memories.Born Gusta Wolf to a Hasidic family, Ms. Berlinski has fond memories of growing up in Oswiecim, where about half the 12,000 residents were Jewish.“I very much loved that town,” she said.She met Elec, from nearby Sosnowiec, where her father had a furniture store, through their activities in Beitar, the right-wing Zionist youth movement. Ten days after marrying, they set off for what was then the British Mandate of Palestine, to join the pioneers working to establish Israel.They arrived on a ship of unauthorized immigrants, landing clandestinely, at night, south of Haifa, to evade the British authorities, who had imposed restrictions on Jewish immigration.For a while, she said, she kept contact with her family until it was no longer possible to get letters to them. According to Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial, the Jews of Oswiecim, whose property had been confiscated, were rounded up in 1941 and deported to ghettos, including to Sosnowiec, before being sent to the death camps. The town’s once-thriving Jewish community ceased to exist.Ms. Berlinski was the oldest of six children. Her parents and four siblings were killed — most of them, she said, in Auschwitz. One sister survived, then moved to Germany and, eventually, to Israel. She is the one who lived to tell Ms. Berlinski that the rest of the family had perished.“I felt great pain,” Ms. Berlinski said. “That pain I feel to this day.”Life in the British Mandate of Palestine, carved out of the former Ottoman Empire, was hard at first. The young couple, who remained childless, lived in the mobilized units formed by Beitar. Ms. Berlinski worked in the kitchens and orchards. Elec spent a few months in a British prison camp and fought in the Negev during the 1948 war over the creation of the Israeli state.Having left Beitar, which they found too militaristic, the couple moved to Tel Aviv. Ms. Berlinski took up acting for a while at the Cameri Theater. Mr. Berlinski had begun working for the government, and around 1950, they moved to Jerusalem. Ms. Berlinski began studying at one of the young state’s oldest institutions, the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design.In the 1970s, she joined the Climate group of Israeli artists, which promoted the idea of local Israeli painting as a rejection of imported art movements, but she soon broke with them, and the group was dismantled. Ms. Berlinski moved to the left politically and became active in Peace Now, an Israeli group that advocates ending the occupation, and a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Ultimately, Ms. Berlinski’s life, and the tribute exhibition of her work, is a celebration of endurance and survival. But she has not shut out Poland or Oswiecim; she has been back several times. In Oswiecim, she has visited the children of a woman who had been her mother’s close friend.She remembered her mother’s garden being full of flowers. The black flowers, she said, were for her parents, since there were no graves to visit, nothing left. She donated a painting of a black flower to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum during a visit to the former concentration camp in 2006.On the wall of her living room, among portraits, is a framed letter in Polish. It was signed by the mayor of Oswiecim, congratulating her on reaching the age of 100.“On this extraordinary day, I extend to you greetings from the heart, from the city of your birth, Oswiecim.”', '                                    At least 63 babies have been fathered by Palestinians in Israeli prisons, authorities say.

Al-Qawari’s brother, Mohammed, said Ra’fat’s wife had suffered three miscarriages before he opted for the smuggling method.Mohammed Al-Qarawi said Israeli authorities barred the couple from seeing each other for 18 months when they found out about the child.“They wanted to have a DNA test done to confirm if the baby was indeed my brother’s, but he refused and the matter went away,” he said.Israel Prison Service spokesperson Hana Herbst told The Media Line that the IPS checks every object that enters or leaves prison.“Any illegal smuggling attempts are dealt with by disciplinary or administrative means,” she said.Issa Qaraqe, the Palestinian Authority’s Prisoner Affairs Minister, described the practice as a “revolution” that helps prisoners “strive to maintain families, and this is a great challenge taking into account the harsh reality inside Israeli prisons.”The treatments are carried out on the wives of prisoners with the permission of the Palestinian Authority’s religious council. The fertility center in the city of Nablus provides the procedure —which typically costs around $3,000 —free of charge, but requires two relatives from each side of the family to verify the identity of the father.Click for more from The Media Line.', "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – Hosting a Los Angeles event with the son of Bahrain's king, two prominent U.S. rabbis let something slip out: the island nation's ruler thinks the longtime boycott of Israel by Arab countries should end.The rabbis' revelation of the king's opinion shouldn't come as too much of a surprise — Arab nations have slowly inched closer to Israel in recent years, partly because both sides remain incredibly suspicious of Iran's intentions as the wars in Iraq and Syria wind down.Bahrain may prove to be the test case for other Gulf Arab nations about coming out of the closet about their mutual interests.

Mr. Trump made the formal announcement during a speech in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, with Vice President Mike Pence standing behind him.The following is a transcript of his remarks, as prepared by The New York Times.For more coverage and analysis, read here._______PRESIDENT TRUMP:Thank you. When I came into office, I promised to look at the world’s challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking.We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past. All challenges demand new approaches.My announcement today marks the beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.In 1995, Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act urging the federal government to relocate the American Embassy to Jerusalem and to recognize that that city, and so importantly, is Israel’s capital. This act passed congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. And was reaffirmed by unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago.Yet, for over 20 years, every previous American president has exercised the law’s waiver, refusing to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem or to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital city. Presidents issued these waivers under the belief that delaying the recognition of Jerusalem would advance the cause of peace. Some say they lacked courage but they made their best judgments based on facts as they understood them at the time. Nevertheless, the record is in.After more than two decades of waivers, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result.Therefore, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver.Today, I am delivering. I’ve judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. This is a long overdue step to advance the peace process. And to work towards a lasting agreement.Israel is a sovereign nation with the right, like every other sovereign nation, to determine its own capital. Acknowledging this is a fact is a necessary condition for achieving peace. It was 70 years ago that the United States under President Truman recognized the state of Israel.Ever since then, Israel has made its capital in the city of Jerusalem, the capital the Jewish people established in ancient times.Today, Jerusalem is the seat of the modern Israeli government. It is the home of the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, as well as the Israeli Supreme Court. It is the location of the official residence of the prime minister and the president. It is the headquarters of many government ministries.For decades, visiting American presidents, secretaries of State and military leaders have met their Israeli counterparts in Jerusalem, as I did on my trip to Israel earlier this year.Jerusalem is not just the heart of three great religions, but it is now also the heart of one of the most successful democracies in the world. Over the past seven decades, the Israeli people have by the a country where Jews, Muslims and Christians and people of all faiths are free to live and worship according to their conscience and according to their beliefs.Jerusalem is today and must remain a place where Jews pray at the Western Wall, where Christians walk the stations of the cross, and where Muslims worship at Al Aqsa Mosque. However, through all of these years, presidents representing the United States have declined to officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. In fact, we have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital at all.But today we finally acknowledge the obvious. That Jerusalem is Israel’s capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It’s something that has to be done.That is why consistent with the Jerusalem embassy act, I am also directing the State Department to begin preparation to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This will immediately begin the process of hiring architects, engineers and planners so that a new embassy, when completed, will be a magnificent tribute to peace.In making these announcements, I also want to make one point very clear. This decision is not intended in any way to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement.We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians. We are not taking a position of any final status issues including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem or the resolution of contested borders. Those questions are up to the parties involved.The United States remains deeply committed to helping facilitate a peace agreement that is acceptable to both sides. I intend to do everything in my power to help forge such an agreement.Without question, Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive issues in those talks. The United States would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides. In the meantime, I call on all parties to maintain the status quo at Jerusalem’s holy sites including the Temple Mount, also known as Haram al-Sharif. Above all, our greatest hope is for peace. The universal yearning in every human soul.With today’s action, I reaffirm my administration’s longstanding commitment to a future of peace and security for the region. There will, of course, be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement. But we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a peace and a place far greater in understanding and cooperation. This sacred city should call forth the best in humanity.Lifting our sights to what is possible, not pulling us back and down to the old fights that have become so totally predictable.Peace is never beyond the grasp of those willing to reach it.So today we call for calm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate. Our children should inherit our love, not our conflicts. I repeat the message I delivered at the historic and extraordinary summit in Saudi Arabia earlier this year: The Middle East is a region rich with culture, spirit, and history. Its people are brilliant, proud and diverse. Vibrant and strong.But the incredible future awaiting this region is held at bay by bloodshed, ignorance and terror.Vice President Pence will travel to the region in the coming days to reaffirm our commitment to work with partners throughout the Middle East to defeat radicalism that threatens the hopes and dreams of future generations.It is time for the many who desire peace to expel the extremists from their midsts. It is time for all civilized nations and people to respond to disagreement with reasoned debate, not violence. And it is time for young and moderate voices all across the Middle East to claim for themselves a bright and beautiful future.So today, let us rededicate ourselves to a path of mutual understanding and respect. Let us rethink old assumptions and open our hearts and minds to possible and possibilities.And finally, I ask the leaders of the region political and religious, Israeli and Palestinian, Jewish and Christian and Muslim to join us in the noble quest for lasting peace.Thank you. God bless you. God bless Israel. God bless the Palestinians and God bless the United States.Thank you very much. Thank you.', '3 Weddings, 4 Dozen Rabbis and 1,400 Cupcakes - The New York TimesThere was no cocktail hour, no chicken dinner, no teary-eyed mothers and fathers, and no beaming grandparents. But this was a grand Jewish wedding celebration, which took nine months to plan, in one of the largest synagogues in the United States.Three couples, each denied Jewish wedding ceremonies in Israel for various reasons, were married on Dec. 3 in a ceremony at Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan.Gady Levy, the executive director of the Temple Emanu-El Streicker Center, and Rabbi Joshua Davidson, the senior rabbi at the temple, began planning the event last March. “We met with people from the Israel Religious Action Center in Israel to find a way to make a change in the marriage laws there, and we decided that having a real wedding in New York was the way,” Mr. Levy said.In order to produce the wedding, Mr. Levy said with a smile, “I became a part-time wedding planner.” The event he arranged was a stunner: Three couples were married in a traditional ceremony with klezmer music, violins, flowers, white wedding dresses and cupcakes. It was an event he called “Three Weddings and a Statement.”The festivities started at the Friday evening service at Temple Emanu-El, where Rabbi Davidson spoke, beginning the pre-wedding ceremony for the couples with a traditional blessing.“We love Israel and wish it to be the spiritual homeland for all Jews,” he said. “We wish for all Jews and non-Jews alike to be treated equally there. The events this weekend are about religious and civil liberties in Israel.”The three couples had no bridesmaids, no groomsmen, no parents attending.But there were more than 1,300 guests, six rabbis leading the ceremony and about 40 more who stood with them to bless the newlyweds at the closing of the Sunday wedding ceremony.It was produced flawlessly, like good theater, set in the sanctuary of the Romanesque Revival building with its 60 stained-glass windows and an altar built of marble flanked by sturdy columns of golden mosaics that soar. It might have seemed like theater (tickets, which were free, were needed for admission), but the message and the messengers were very serious.Since there is no separation of church and state in Israel, there is no going to city hall to be married. And for a Jewish wedding in Israel, a couple must fulfill the Orthodox rules of marriage. Those rules include the fact that same-sex unions are not permitted; the acquisition whereby the groom pays a bride price as is reflected in the wording of the traditional marriage contract (ketubah); and if the marriage does not work out, only the man is allowed to initiate a divorce.However, in New York City any couple, gay or straight, may obtain a marriage license; have a legal, civil ceremony; or ask a rabbi or other person who is certified to sign the license.And so, there in the huge, majestic Emanu-El sanctuary, under a wedding canopy, and dressed in a strapless wedding gown designed by Danielle Caprese, stood Ori Berwald Shaer, 30, ready to marry her best friend and the love of her life, Alona Livneh, 26, who wore a blue pantsuit and a pink bow tie. Both women, who live in Tel Aviv, are activists in the gay and lesbian community in Israel.The couple arrived in Manhattan on Friday morning, went to City Hall — where they obtained a marriage license in 30 minutes — and were off to find a wedding dress for Ms. Shaer to wear. (Kleinfeld Bridal donated the three wedding dresses.)“The ease of getting a marriage license here was very exciting,” Ms. Shaer said.Ms. Livneh said: “The dream is to get married in Israel, in our language, in our culture, with our family and friends. But with that not being possible we’re going with the next best option.”Dani Dayan, the consul general of Israel in New York, said in a text message that it is “no secret many members of the American Jewish community disagree with existing Israeli legislation on civil status issues. Israelis pay serious attention to the positions of our brethren across the Atlantic, and ultimately the Israeli Knesset — elected democratically by the Israeli citizens — legislates. I wish a heartfelt Mazel Tov to the couples married today in New York.”(The Israeli Ministry of Religious Services and the Chief Rabbinate in Israel did not respond to a request to comment about the event.)But legally recognized weddings abroad — whether civil, or any other form — are recognized by the Interior Ministry for the purposes of being registered as a married couple in Israel.Gali Geberovich, 29, and Alon Sela, 30, met seven years ago on a kibbutz. Both finished their military service and were working, without pay, he in a cowshed, she in a factory.“We smelled really bad after a day of work, but it was very romantic,” Ms. Geberovich said. They now live in Tel Aviv, where she works for the reform movement while studying for a master’s degree in Jewish education at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and Mr. Sela is an analyst in an investment banking consulting firm with an interest in high technology and renewable energy.“We didn’t want any ceremony that doesn’t reflect our beliefs and values as a couple,” Ms. Geberovich said. “We have a really respectful and equal relationship, and the ceremony of the Orthodox does not reflect it.“We didn’t want to use our privilege and be part of an institution that doesn’t recognize other couples. We have in our family, we have our friends, same-gender couples and they don’t have the right to get married and it’s unbelievable. And also, I didn’t want to be part of that institution.”For Valentine Boldovsky, 29, and Elizabetha Komkov, 27, students at the Technion in Haifa, a wedding in the United States was also a solution to a spiritual problem they have in Israel, a country they both emigrated to with their families for reasons of oppression where they were born.Ms. Komkov and Mr. Boldovsky, both born in St. Petersburg, Russia, met as young teenagers at a Jewish Sunday school run by the Jewish Agency in St. Petersburg. Both families immigrated to Israel; hers in 2004, his in 2005. The two had lost track of each other but became reacquainted five years ago on Facebook.Even though Ms. Komkov was raised in a Jewish family, she decided to convert in Israel with a reform rabbi in order to have proof of her Jewishness. She did not have proof, she said, because her maternal grandmother was given to a Christian family during Stalin’s time in Russia, when many Jewish families were persecuted. Therefore, Ms. Komkov had no documents to prove maternal religious heritage. A reform conversion is not recognized by the strictly Orthodox religious authorities in Israel.Mr. Boldovsky said, “It’s really important for Liza to bring this heritage and the memory of her grandmother.”He said that because Ms. Komkov is not considered Jewish enough for the Orthodox rabbinate in Israel they wanted to make a statement. “So someone will hear it, so people will pay attention, so they will know that there is a problem,” he said. “And that this problem will not go on for our children and so on and so on. I’m not separating the marriage from the political aspect, I am separating my vows to my wife from the political aspect, because it’s about love, not about any of this mess.”On Sunday, before the ceremony, while guests were taking their seats in the sanctuary, a klezmer band led by Michael Winograd entertained the audience and set a joyful, foot-stomping mood.Then at 11 a.m., as the ceremony was about to begin, 10 violinists strolled down the center aisle of the temple playing “Sunrise, Sunset” followed by “Erev Shel Shoshanim,” a Hebrew love song often played at weddings.When the music ended, each couple entered from side aisles, one partner from each side, joining in the center to walk up the steps to the altar, taking their places under three wedding canopies that were on the stage. Each canopy had one of three words printed on the front: “Equality,” “Justice,” “Love.” Under each canopy were a couple and two rabbis, one female, one male.The traditional ceremony included drinking wine from silver goblets, the chanting of the seven blessings by Cantor Mo Glazman of the temple and the breaking of glasses (both brides and grooms stepped on glasses, which is not traditional but served as a nod to feminism and equality; historically only the groom breaks a glass). Afterward, about 40 rabbis from all denominations, including Modern Orthodoxy, joined the couples on the stage for concluding prayers, songs and spirited circle dancing.The klezmer band started up again as the now married couples happily pranced back up the center aisle to a loud, collective yell of “mazel tov” from the crowd.And just outside the temple doors on Fifth Avenue, there were 1,400 white wedding cupcakes waiting, each with a tiny plastic solitaire ring atop the shiny frosting.', 'Full Video: President Trump Speaks on Jerusalem - Video - NYTimes.com', '', '', 'To Stop North Korea, Act Like Israel - The New York TimesThe news last week from the Korean Peninsula about yet another ballistic missile launch was déjà vu all over again. This one had an estimated range of 8,100 miles — long enough to hit Washington, D.C., or anywhere else in the continental United States. President Trump responded with angry tweets, but Kim Jong-un has good reason to be cocky.The strongman knows all too well that a military response is highly unlikely. There are some 8,000 North Korean cannons and rocket launchers aimed at Seoul, in effect holding the approximately 10 million inhabitants of that city hostage. All sides realize that the human and economic costs of another Korean war are simply unfathomable.Several American presidents have tried to persuade the Kim dynasty to abandon its nuclear ambitions, through a combination of sanctions and negotiations. But these efforts have been unsuccessful.In part that’s because the Kim family never ran North Korea like a normal nation. Even in a rogue nation like Iran, the vise of economic embargoes can force hard-liners to change their behavior. Not so with North Korea, which has been able to skirt sanctions and United Nations resolutions because it is run more like a Mafia fief than a state.The North’s criminal empire is vast and global. According to the Strategic Studies Institute, it includes narcotics trafficking and the counterfeiting of United States currency. North Korea has also been accused of the online hacking of bank accounts; the sale of nuclear know-how; black-market arms sales, including scud and other missiles to Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, Eritrea and other nations; and a whole military enterprise set up to steal crypto currencies.This criminal syndicate is run out of North Korea’s mysterious Office 39, a bureau that, according to the Treasury Department, “provides critical support to North Korean leadership in part through engaging in illicit economic activities.” Every cog of the nation’s machinery is mobilized to facilitate the regime’s racketeering: Defectors have described schoolchildren working in poppy fields; they say cash and smuggled goods are brought in on state-owned merchant vessels; and diplomats peddle heroin. Crime is North Korea’s national industry.As in any organized crime entity, the underbosses keep Mr. Kim’s regime afloat. Their loyalty has been bought and paid for with lavish wealth and privilege. So far, these crime bosses have been masterful at circumventing the sanctions that have primarily hurt the enslaved North Korean population.That’s why the United States and its allies ought to take a page from an Israeli playbook and wage financial warfare against Mr. Kim and his cabal.The notion behind using money as a weapon against terrorism belonged to Meir Dagan, a legendary soldier and spymaster who developed the idea in the nascent days of Israel’s fight against Hamas and terror groups supported by Yasir Arafat’s Palestinian Authority. Mr. Dagan rightly believed that money was the oxygen that fueled the groups’ suicide bombing campaign against Israel. If Israeli security services could suffocate the funds that paid for the bloodshed, the attacks would stop.In 1996, Mr. Dagan created a task force code-named Harpoon that mobilized government agencies to focus on the money reaching terror cells from state sponsors and international charities. When Mr. Dagan became head of the Mossad, in 2002, Harpoon became an operational unit inside Israeli intelligence. His spies used the same aggressive action and imaginative chutzpah that had made the Mossad a storied force to follow those funds and to go after Mr. Arafat’s millions and the charities around the world that funneled cash into Hamas’s coffers.Harpoon targeted the banks that held accounts belonging to Palestinian terrorist commanders, and the unit encouraged lawyers — including me — to launch suits in United States federal court seeking monetary damages for victims of state sponsors of terror so that countries like Syria, Iran and even North Korea would realize that the costs of blowing up buses outweighed the political ends the carnage hoped to achieve.The combined espionage, military and legal offensive helped end the intifada by making it too expensive to continue.The unit’s greatest success came several years after the intifada, during the Second Lebanon War, when Mr. Dagan urged the Israeli Air Force to destroy the banks where Hezbollah kept its cash. Although Hezbollah, the Iranian-supported Lebanese terrorist group, received hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Tehran, it was a global criminal enterprise involved in everything from cocaine trafficking to stealing cars and money laundering. These activities funded its operations against Israel and against American forces in Iraq.With the assistance of branches of the United States government, including the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department, Harpoon went after Hezbollah’s cocaine business in Venezuela and in Lebanon, as well as its money-laundering activities in West Africa and America. Brilliant operations and cons were carried out against Hezbollah’s captains — operations that ultimately stripped them of the vast fortunes they had assembled over the years. And when the Hezbollah hierarchy was cash strapped, Harpoon targeted the financial institutions that allowed the terrorists to move their cash across continents, ultimately shutting down the Lebanese Canadian Bank, one of the largest banks in the Middle East. It took the Syrian Civil War, and Hezbollah’s enormous military involvement on behalf of the Assad regime on Tehran’s tab, to provide the Party of God with a financial lifeline. But the fact remains that one of the results of Israel’s financial war against Hezbollah has been that Israel’s northern border has remained relatively quiet for more than 11 years.Most military commanders acknowledge that there are very few, if any, feasible solutions to today’s standoff with Pyongyang. The only effective path is to unleash an offensive press against Kim’s inner circle.The United States must take the lead by ramping up a covert campaign against the regime’s criminal enterprises. This effort ought to include a full-court press of dirty tricks, coercion, heavy-handed threats and even direct action, all covert and deniable, against Kim’s financial wizards who handle the finances, dispense the narcotics and hijack Bitcoins.Such tradecraft must also be applied outside North Korea and Asia against the businesses and banks in Europe, South America and elsewhere that enable Kim’s criminal empire to flourish; bankers and businessmen are less likely to have the mettle to resist a late-night visit by men who could ruin their lives. And as North Korea is recognized as a state sponsor of terror, helping groups like Hezbollah with arms and expertise, a numbing slew of lawsuits should be filed seeking damages; those damages will result in the forfeiture of North Korean assets — open and hidden — around the world.Sanctions alone will not work. They have done nothing to stop the missile tests and the saber rattling. Only when the money dries up will the loyalty of the men in Kim’s inner circle be compromised and cut away. The North Korean dictator will then be under enormous pressure to do whatever he can to alleviate the effects of the spies tapping into his cash and control. With full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula as the only other alternative, there isn’t much of a choice.', '', '', 'COPENHAGEN, Denmark – Israeli nuclear whistleblower Mordecai Vanunu has been granted permission to immigrate to Norway so he can be united with his Norwegian wife.Vanunu\'s wife, Kristin Joachimsen, told Norway\'s TV2 channel Friday the couple requested family reunification after they wed in May 2015.

He sought asylum in Norway after his 2004 release.Israel then banned him from speaking with foreigners and leaving the country, among other restrictions.Israel neither confirms nor denies its nuclear weapons capability.', 'Palestinian Rivals Talk Unity but Show Divisions - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — As the rival Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas began unity talks on Tuesday in Cairo, one detail stood out as emblematic of the challenges they face: The delegation representing Hamas is led by a man who has been accused of plotting to overthrow the president of the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas.If that awkward hurdle can be overcome, the talks would have at least the potential to end the decade-long, sometimes bloody schism between the two groups and reshape the region’s political map. The effort is being propelled to a great extent by the increasingly desperate humanitarian situation among the two million residents of Gaza.That being said, few here think the two groups will bridge their differences.From the outset, they are approaching the Egyptian-sponsored reconciliation process with divergent, and often mutually exclusive, ideas of where the talks should lead and even of what unity means.The aging and unpopular Mr. Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority holds sway in part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, hopes to wrest back control of the Gaza Strip from Hamas after a 10-year absence. Hamas says it has disbanded its administrative control of Gaza and relinquished all responsibility for civilian affairs there. But it sees unity as an opportunity to regain a foothold — and eventually take over — in the West Bank.One major sticking point is who will control security in Gaza, where Hamas’s military wing has built up a formidable arsenal of thousands of rockets, missiles and drones, as well as a network of fortified tunnels, and has fought three wars against Israel.Hamas says its maintenance of control over its “weapons of resistance” is nonnegotiable. But Mr. Abbas said he would not tolerate a Gaza version of “the Hezbollah model in Lebanon,” in which a heavily armed nonstate organization exerts influence over a weak government and hollowed-out national institutions.“Reconciliation is something that none of the parties can afford,” said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political scientist at Birzeit University in the West Bank.“Hamas cannot change its politics in order to be part of the P.L.O.,” he said, referring to the Palestine Liberation Organization, the main Palestinian umbrella group also led by Mr. Abbas. At the same time, he said, “the P.L.O. cannot accept Hamas without it changing its policies, or it will lose its international recognition.”In short, he concluded, “Hamas will not give up its military capabilities, its only source of power, and Abbas cannot accept the Lebanese model.”Nevertheless, while numerous attempts at Palestinian unity have failed in the past, experts in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Israel say this effort seems more serious. Hamas is under new leadership. The United States and other international players want to see the Palestinian Authority take charge of Gaza ahead of a possible resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. And all the parties, including Israel, are growing increasingly concerned about the humanitarian situation there.Only limited aid can flow to the area as long as Hamas, considered a terrorist group by Israel, the United States and the European Union, is in control. A new influx of foreign assistance through the Palestinian Authority and a new regime for Gaza’s border crossings with Israel and Egypt, allowing for more movement of people and goods could, analysts say, alleviate the suffering and prevent an explosion.“The lowest common denominator that everyone agrees on is the deteriorating situation in Gaza,” Mr. Khatib said. “What is most probably going to happen is much, much less than reconciliation, but some little bit of progress beyond the current reality.”Last week Israel allowed a large delegation of government and security officials from the Palestinian Authority, led by Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, to pass through its territory to hold a ceremonial cabinet meeting in Gaza as an early display of unity.Given the many complexities, some analysts said that any celebrations over Mr. Hamdallah’s arrival in Gaza may have been premature.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for one, warned that Israel was “not interested in a bogus reconciliation in which the Palestinian factions reconcile with each other at the expense of our existence.” He insisted, among other things, on Hamas dismantling its military wing and recognizing Israel.Palestinian observers pointed to other ominous signs, like Mr. Hamdallah’s swift departure from Gaza and an apparent lack of enthusiasm from Mr. Abbas, who has not yet canceled the economic sanctions he imposed on Gaza to force Hamas to yield control.“Rami Hamdallah went there as a kind of visitor or tourist, as if Ban Ki-moon was visiting,” said Zakaria al-Qaq, a Palestinian expert in national security at Al Quds University in East Jerusalem, referring to the former secretary-general of the United Nations. “As the days go by, the Palestinian Authority is adding more conditions.”At first, Mr. Qaq said, Mr. Abbas merely demanded the dismantling of Hamas’s shadow government. “Now,” he said, “they are saying they have to renegotiate everything and are talking about Hezbollah and Hamas.”But even if Mr. Abbas is reluctant to act as a subcontractor in solving Gaza’s troubles, the Palestinian public has long demanded unity and Mr. Abbas has publicly committed to trying to achieve it, though his representatives say it is likely to take some time.“This is a long process,” Azzam al-Ahmad, the head of the Fatah delegation to Cairo, told the official Voice of Palestine radio on Tuesday. “We will discuss elections, the judiciary, security, the P.L.O., all of these things.”The head of the Hamas delegation, Salah al-Arouri, is the newly-appointed deputy chief of the group’s political bureau. Currently living in exile, he was accused by Israel in 2014 of plotting a coup against Mr. Abbas.Even if the talks accomplish little, an Israeli analyst said, they are still worth pursuing. “There is no tax on talking,” said Shalom Harari, a retired Israeli general and former senior adviser on Palestinian affairs to Israel’s Defense Ministry. Yet, he added, “the maximum that can be achieved is an interim arrangement with some changes at the crossings — a mini reconciliation.”Talal Okal, a veteran political analyst in Gaza, said Hamas was trying to take on a more national role and to strengthen its relations with Egypt. “I think Hamas is ready for understandings about resistance here,” Mr. Okal said. “Nobody can remove their weapons and armaments, but they will find a way to put this aside for a while.”Hamas says the current talks should be based on a reconciliation agreement reached in Cairo in 2011, which called for a unity government and legislative and presidential elections within a year.But the crux of the problem, said Michael Herzog, an Israel-based fellow with The Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has participated in most of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, is that Hamas and Fatah appeared to be going into the negotiations with different goals and visions.“For Abbas, this is about Hamas giving up control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority,” Mr. Herzog said. “The way Hamas sees it, it’s a two-way street. They give up some control of Gaza, but in return the West Bank opens up to them, they are allowed to operate there and this opens the way for Hamas to take over the Palestinian national movement.”For Israel, the United States and other international players, the prospects of any peace process will depend on the outcome. “If the Authority takes full control of Gaza and can deliver Gaza, that will be a good thing,” Mr. Herzog said. “If Hamas ultimately becomes a dominant party in policy decisions on the Palestinian side, that’s a bad thing.”', 'JERUSALEM – Israelis celebrate it. Palestinians despise it. The Balfour Declaration, Britain\'s promise to Zionists to create a Jewish home in what is now Israel, turns 100 this week, with events in Israel, the Palestinian territories and Britain drawing attention to the now yellowing document tucked away in London\'s British Library.Historians still muse about Britain\'s motivations and its commitment to the declaration waned in the decades after it was issued. Yet the 67 words penned by a British Cabinet minister still resonate loudly 100 years later, with both the Israelis and Palestinians seizing the anniversary to reinforce its narrative and justify its positions.Each side is marking the centenary in starkly different ways, shining a light on the chasm between Israel and the Palestinians that some say was cleaved on Nov. 2, 1917."It\'s so divisive even today because Zionists think that the Balfour Declaration laid the foundation stone for modern Israel — and they\'re right to think that — and by the same token non-Jewish Palestinians and Arabs see it as the foundation stone of their dispossession and misery," said Jonathan Schneer, a historian who authored a book on the document."Everything stems from the Balfour Declaration," he said.The declaration was the result of discussions between British Zionist leaders seeking political recognition of their goals for Jewish statehood and British politicians embroiled in the First World War. Written by British Foreign Secretary Lord Arthur Balfour and addressed to Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild, a British financier and Zionist leader, the declaration promised British assistance to create a Jewish homeland."His Majesty\'s government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object," the declaration goes, continuing with a caveat: "It being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine."British motives for issuing the declaration include imperialist political calculations meant to secure a foothold in the eastern Levant amid the collapse of the Ottoman Empire to the messianism of British politicians steeped in biblical history, hoping to restore Jews to their ancestral home.The declaration served as the basis for the British Mandate of Palestine, which was approved in 1920 by the League of Nations, a precursor to the United Nations. The following decades saw a spike in the number of Jews immigrating to Palestine and the buds of Zionist state institutions taking root. With that came increased friction with the Arab population, setting the stage for conflict that continues to this day.That fraught history is being reflected today in how both Israel and the Palestinians are using the declaration\'s centenary to enforce their stances.Israel views the pledge as the first international recognition granted to the Jewish people\'s desire to return to its historic homeland. It sees Britain as having played a supporting role in a narrative dominated by the determination, heroism and pioneering spirit of the early settlers who fought to build the state."While the state would not have arisen without settlement, sacrifice and a willingness to fight for it, the international impetus was, undoubtedly, the Balfour Declaration," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this week.Israel is planning a major campaign meant to drive home that narrative and zero in on its warm ties with Britain, an important ally when the European Union has taken steps against Israel\'s West Bank settlements in recent years. Netanyahu will travel to London, where he will mark the anniversary on Thursday at a festive dinner hosted by the current Lords Balfour and Rothschild and attended by British Prime Minister Theresa May. An "anniversary concert" in London this weekend will feature British performers alongside a Jewish Israeli clarinetist and a pianist who is an Arab citizen of Israel.The anniversary is being marked far more morosely by the Palestinians. They see the declaration as the original sin, a harbinger of their "nakba," or catastrophe, the mass displacement that resulted from the war surrounding Israel\'s creation in 1948. That refugee crisis reverberates across the region today, and the Palestinians have cast Israel, through the declaration and its imperialist British patrons, as a colonial enterprise.The Palestinians, who have spent recent years seeking recognition for their state at international institutions, are demanding British accountability. They want an apology and have threatened to sue Britain over the declaration."We asked them to make it right, to make this historical oppression right by recognizing the state of Palestine and apologizing to the Palestinian people," said Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki. He said they have asked Britain to issue a new declaration that would be more favorable to the Palestinians, a request he said London rejected.Protests are planned in the Palestinian territories, where thousands of students will stand in their schoolyards on Thursday demanding Britain dismiss the declaration, and in Britain, where dozens of cars will be emblazoned with posters condemning the declaration. In Jerusalem, thousands of letters from Palestinian schoolchildren are to be delivered to the British Consulate.Britain, meanwhile, has treaded lightly, casting the anniversary as a commemoration and not a celebration."We will mark the centenary with pride and respect, but also with a degree of sadness, as issues between Israel and the Palestinians remain unresolved," Middle East Minister Alistair Burt said last week.By the 1930s, a new government in Britain was backing away from its earlier promise to the Zionists, with an official commission of inquiry deciding that Britain\'s mandate over Palestine, with its constant internecine violence, proved untenable. The 1937 Peel Commission recommended that the land be split between Arabs and Jews. Relations between the Jews in Mandatory Palestine and Britain would further deteriorate before Israel declared independence.Israel would later capture more territory in the 1967 Mideast war, including east Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, land the Palestinians want for their hoped-for state. The years since have been pockmarked by repeated spasms of violence and hopes for peace dwindling."The Balfour Declaration is being used by both sides to advance a present agenda," said Martin Kramer, a historian at Jerusalem\'s Shalem College. "There are reasons for Israelis to be grateful for it and reasons for the Palestinians to regret it but it\'s history. It can\'t be changed."___Associated Press writers Mohammed Daraghmeh in Ramallah, West Bank, and Jill Lawless in London contributed reporting.', '', 'NICOSIA, Cyprus – Israel\'s energy minister says a potential undersea pipeline carrying natural gas from deposits in the eastern Mediterranean to Europe is "very realistic" and could help secure the continent\'s energy future.Yuval Steinitz told The Associated Press Tuesday that a study on the project shows that the pipeline is feasible, even though it presents technical challenges due to the sea depths involved.He said the estimated 6.2 billion euro (7.36 billion) pipeline could take 6-7 years to build and the countries involved in the project "are serious about it: it will happen."Steinitz was speaking ahead of Tuesday\'s signing of an agreement between Cyprus, Israel, Greece and Italy to examine the possibility of building the pipeline.The Israeli official said an undersea pipeline would be less vulnerable to sabotage.', 'Israel, Al Franken, Los Angeles: Your Thursday Briefing - The New York TimesGood morning.Here’s what you need to know:• Palestinians clashed with Israeli forces in the West Bank and along the border with Gaza today, as widespread predictions of unrest were realized after President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.Mr. Trump had acknowledged that his decision to move the U.S. Embassy  from Tel Aviv was a provocative one.But he played a familiar role on Wednesday, the political insurgent defying traditional foreign policy, while also fulfilling a campaign promise.

Minutes after the president’s address, the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who rarely engages the press at the world body, came out and read a statement that in part criticized the president’s new policy on Jerusalem.“From day one as Secretary-General of the United Nations, I have consistently spoken out against any unilateral measures that would jeopardize the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians,” Guterres said.While taking no questions from reporters, Guterres said there can be no other way to peace other than the two-state solution: “In this moment of great anxiety, I want to make it clear — there is no alternative to the two-state solution. There is no Plan B.”Seven members of the U.N. Security Council have requested an emergency meeting on Jerusalem that could come as early as Friday. Those members include the U.K, France, Egypt and Sweden.Earlier in the day, an outspoken critic of the U.S. and Israel, Ambassador Sacha Llorentty-Soliz of Bolivia, told reporters if Trump went ahead with his decision, it would threaten the peace process and would be “a reckless and a dangerous decision that goes against international law and resolutions of the Security Council.”While President-elect, Trump took aim at the U.N.’s anti-Israel stance following passage of U.N. Resolution 2334, a legally binding U.N. Security Council resolution that said Israel’s presence in parts of Jerusalem was illegal. The December 2016 vote resulted in the Obama administration famously changing decades of U.S. policy by refusing to veto the anti-Israel measure that said settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem was a fragrant violation of international law.The United Nations may hold an emergency meeting after President Donald Trump declared the holy city Jerusalem as Israel’s capital Wednesday. The flag of Israel is seen near the flag of the US in this photo.(Fox News)A few days after the resolution passed, Trump tweeted that, “We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but…” he continued, “not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!”A longtime Republican foreign policy advisor close to the White House told Fox News on background that, “The Obama administration secretly helped draft and pass the December 2016 resolution denying Israel’s connection to Jerusalem. President-elect Trump immediately blasted the resolution and promised to end that nonsense. His speech today is exactly what he promised. It is an arrow aimed at the heart of U.N. bias against Israel. “Concerns over the Security Council resolution and anti-Israel bias have been a consistent feature of U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley’s tenure in New York.Haley released a statement on the president’s decision calling the move a “courageous and historic step.” Haley, who visited Israel in June, added, “Across the globe, America has its embassy in the capital city of the host country. Israel will now be no different. It is the just and right thing to do.”Eugene Kontorovich, head of international law at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a Jerusalem think tank, has testified to Congress on the subject, and said Trump’s decision on Jerusalem is the right one.“President Trump has complete authority under U.S. and international law to recognize Jerusalem on behalf of the U.S.,” Kontorovich said. “U.N Sec. Res 2344 is entirely non-binding. Nothing in international law prevents this. Moreover, the president has complete constitutional power to recognize Jerusalem as Israeli, as the Supreme Court ruled a few years ago in the Jerusalem passport case.”Kontorovich, who is a professor of international and constitutional law at Northwestern University, continued, “This is a bold and historic decision, comparable to the President Truman’s recognition of Israel as a state 70 years ago. It rectifies a longstanding absurdity and injustice — treating the capital of the Jewish state as not even part of the country. It also breaks the racist international consensus that holds that Jews cannot live in their holy city’s ancient precincts. It also firmly rejects the view that the 1949 Armistice Lines have any legal status or legitimacy.”Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the world body, hailed Trump’s decision as historic and called on other nations to follow.“Now is the time for all U.N. member-states to follow the lead of our American friends and recognize our ancient capital of Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel,” he said.Ben Evansky reports for Fox Newson the United Nations and international affairs.He can befollowed@BenEvansky', '', '', '', "Archaeologists in Jerusalem have uncovered a new section of the Western Wall that has been hidden for 1,700 years. Experts discover the remains of a theater-like structure that dates to the Roman period.In a stunning discovery, archaeologists in Jerusalem have uncovered a new section of the Western Wall that has been hidden for 1,700 years.Recent excavations at the holy site, which were announced Monday, revealed eight stone courses, or horizontal layers of stones, buried under 26 feet of earth. The completely preserved stone courses are constructed from massive stones and were discovered in Jerusalem’s Western Wall tunnels.The Western Wall is part of an ancient retaining wall supporting the Temple Mount where the Jewish First and Second Temples once stood.ANCIENT DEAL-MAKERS: ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND SHEDS LIGHT ON BIBLICAL KINGDOMThe Wilson’s Arch excavation in its first stages.

The theater corresponds to historical records that describe a theater near Jerusalem’s Temple Mount.The finds were made beneath Wilson’s Arch, a structure at the Northern end of the Western Wall plaza that was once part of a huge bridge leading to the Temple Mount.“From a research perspective, this is a sensational find,” said site excavators Dr. Joe Uziel, Tehillah Lieberman and Dr. Avi Solomon, in a statement. “The discovery was a real surprise.”When excavations began at the site, the archaeologists’ goal was to date Wilson’s Arch, but they uncovered much more. “We did not imagine that a window would open for us onto the mystery of Jerusalem’s lost theater,” the excavators added. “Like much of archaeological research, the expectation is that a certain thing will be found, but at the end of the process other findings, surprising and thought-provoking, are unearthed.”ANCIENT INSCRIPTION UNEARTHED IN JERUSALEM, THRILLING ARCHAEOLOGISTSDr Joe Uziel of the Israel Antiquities Authority, sitting on the steps of the theater structure.

Experts also believe that the structure may have been built for the city council of Roman Jerusalem.Intriguingly, however, archaeologists believe that the theater was not actually used. This theory is supported by a staircase that was never hewn, which indicates that it was abandoned before being put to use. Archaeologists think that the theater may be one of a number of buildings in ancient Jerusalem that were left unfinished as a result of the Bar Kochba revolt by Jews against the Roman Empire in the second century A.D.Other items discovered in the excavation beneath Wilson’s Arch include pottery and coins.RARE 2,000-YEAR-OLD STONE WORKSHOP AND QUARRY DISCOVERED IN ISRAEL'S GALILEEThe Western Wall and the Western Wall Tunnels.

Jordan\'s reservoirs are only one-fifth full, a record low, and vital winter rains are becoming more erratic.Jordanians don\'t need scientists to tell them that they live in one of the world\'s driest countries in the center of the planet\'s most water-poor region.But recent studies suggest the kingdom, a Western ally and refugee host nation with a growing population, is being hit particularly hard by climate change, getting hotter and drier than previously anticipated. One forecast predicts as much as 30 percent less rain by 2100."We are really in trouble if we don\'t take action in time," said Ali Subah, a senior Water Ministry official.But addressing the problem would require cross-border cooperation, a commodity as scarce as water in the Jordan River basin shared by Jordan, Israel, the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.Jordan\'s flagship Red Sea desalination project, which includes a water trade with Israel, has faced repeated delays, most recently because of a diplomatic crisis that led to a scaling back of cross-border contacts since the summer.A master plan by the regional advocacy group EcoPeace that seeks to transform the Jordan River valley into an economically vibrant green oasis by 2050 is based, in part, on a state of Palestine being established on Israeli-occupied lands. Palestinian independence remains distant, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently asserted that Israel will never leave the stretch of the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank.Warning signs abound of what a failure to act looks like.The Dead Sea and Jordan River, global treasures with religious significance as the cradle of Christianity, have been devastated by dropping water levels due to decades of water diversion to urban areas. Some experts suggest civil war in neighboring Syria, which led to a large influx of refugees to Jordan and other neighboring countries, may have been triggered in part and indirectly by a mismanaged drought.Munqeth Mehyar, the president of EcoPeace, said the growing water scarcity urgently requires cooperation."People need to be aware of their water situation, and try to compromise between their water reality and their nationalistic politics," he said at his group\'s lush, formerly arid 270-hectare (675-acre) reserve in the Jordan Valley, a witness to nature\'s power to bounce back.Stanford University researchers say that in the absence of international climate policy action, the kingdom would have 30 percent less rainfall by 2100. Annual average temperatures would increase by 4.5 degrees Celsius (8.1 degrees Fahrenheit) and the number and duration of droughts would double, compared to the 1981-2010 period.Water flows to Jordan from the Yarmouk River, which originates in Syria, would remain low due to droughts and diversion, regardless of when the civil war ends.The results, published in the journal Science Advances and based on improved data analysis tools, suggest the impact of climate change is likely to be more severe than anticipated, said Steven Gorelick, head of the university\'s internationally supported Jordan Water Project.Another study found that man-made climate change was a major force behind an extreme drought in the area in early 2014, said co-author Rachael McDonnell of the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture in Dubai."The findings are more severe than anticipated and more imminent," she said.The World Bank named Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Morocco and Syria as the countries in the Middle East and North Africa that will experience significantly increased water stress driven by climate change. The bank\'s report in August described the region as the "global hotspot of unsustainable water use."Israel is on the road to resolving its water scarcity, producing close to 75 percent of water for domestic use in desalination plants and recycling more than half of its waste water for agricultural use, said Yacov Tsur, a professor of environmental economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Israel is being aided by technological advances, easy access to sea water and a strong economy that can afford large-scale projects, he said.Jordan, which pulls 160 percent more water from the ground than nature puts in, views desalination as the main answer.A Jordan-only option would be costly. Jordan\'s main population center is about 300 kilometers (190 miles) from the only coastline, making it prohibitively expensive to deliver desalinated Red Sea water to the capital, Amman.In recent years, a water trade plan was developed to get around high transport costs.Jordan would desalinate Red Sea water, sell some to nearby southern Israel and pump the brine into the Dead Sea to raise water levels there. Separately, water from northern Israel would be sold to nearby northern Jordan and to Palestinian communities.Israel has a strategic interest in the stability of security ally Jordan, a land buffer against the region\'s turmoil.But the Red Sea-Dead Sea project has hit snags, in part over funding, and Jordan still hasn\'t approached five short-listed consortiums to submit their bids.The ongoing diplomatic crisis, triggered by the fatal shooting of two Jordanians by an Israeli Embassy guard in Amman in July, also contributed to delays by reducing cross-border contacts, said Subah, the Water Ministry official.He said Jordan remains committed to the regional project but will also look at fallback options. "The Jordanian solution for water in the future is desalination," he said. "If it\'s regional, if it\'s on our own, we will go in this direction."Some say the government\'s focus on desalination is linked, in part, to reluctance to implement politically painful conservation measures.For example, more than 50 percent of Jordan\'s water is used for agriculture which produces only a small share of the local food supply.Water for irrigation remains heavily subsidized, encouraging waste and the planting of water-intensive crops such as bananas and tomatoes.About half the water supply is lost from the network, most of it due to misuse or theft.The government has cracked down on illegal water use, announced a slight price increase and plans to ramp up waste water treatment for use in agriculture as budgets permit.But there are fears that draconian reforms could lead to instability, said Hussam Hussein, a water expert at the American University of Beirut."This would not be popular at all," he said. "That\'s why, from a political perspective, it\'s easier for the government to increase the supply and maintain the status quo."At EcoPeace, Jordanian, Israeli and Palestinian activists try not to lose hope, despite what Israeli co-director Gidon Bromberg acknowledged to be "enormous" political obstacles.The group is floating a new swap idea, in addition to the Red-Dead project, in which Jordan would sell solar energy to Israel in exchange for water.Separately, the group\'s master plan outlines 127 projects with an investment value of $4.6 billion to help rehabilitate the Jordan River and the Dead Sea and grow the Jordan Valley\'s economy almost 20-fold by 2050. The group recently identified 13 projects as doable now.In a setback, the diplomatic crisis derailed a conference on the water-energy swap idea and a trilateral official meeting on how to move forward with the 13 projects.Bromberg remains optimistic.He said progress will be made once all involved realize that failure to respond to the water and environmental crises poses a risk to their national security."Where national security interests are clarified, they trump," he said.', 'Priti Patel’s Resignation Adds to Pressure on Theresa May - The New York TimesLONDON — Britain’s international development secretary, Priti Patel, on Wednesday became the second cabinet minister to quit in a week, a significant new setback for Prime Minister Theresa May as her shaky government grapples with critical decisions ahead of the country’s departure from the European Union.Ms. Patel, 45, resigned after breaching ministerial rules by holding a dozen unauthorized meetings with Israeli officials during a summer vacation, giving a misleading impression about whom she had informed and failing to disclose all the relevant details to Mrs. May.This new political turmoil is likely to increase speculation about the strength of Mrs. May’s grip on power, and comes at a tense moment in discussions on quitting the European Union, or Brexit. The resignation also follows a series of sleaze and sexual harassment allegations in Parliament, which prompted another cabinet minister, Defense Secretary Michael Fallon, to quit last week, and threatens another.The litany of accusations against Ms. Patel — who was summoned home from a working visit to Africa — made the minister’s resignation almost inevitable, turning her slow-motion departure from government into a protracted political pantomime.The progress of Ms. Patel’s return flight from Kenya was monitored by thousands online, and on Twitter, users created a hashtag #Prexit — a reference to Ms. Patel’s support for Brexit.Television cameras were on hand at Heathrow Airport to catch Ms. Patel’s arrival and her walk to a waiting official ministerial limousine that took her to London and eventually to 10 Downing Street to meet with Mrs. May.That proved to be one of her last such journeys; within a few hours, Ms. Patel issued a letter accepting that her “actions fell below the high standards that are expected of a secretary of state,” and offering a “fulsome apology,” alongside her resignation.Mrs. May accepted the resignation — rather than firing Ms. Patel — adding that, because “further details have come to light” since a discussion on Monday, it was “right that you have decided to resign.”Critics accused Ms. Patel of freelancing on foreign policy, and her failure to be completely candid about the extent of her activities ultimately sealed her fate, as information kept emerging. Her private meetings included one with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and it later emerged that she discussed sending aid money to the Israeli authorities.Israel’s Haaretz newspaper reported that, during her visit to the country in August, Ms. Patel visited an Israeli military field hospital in Golan Heights, even though her government regards the area as occupied territory.Mrs. May’s office, meanwhile, denied reports in Britain’s Jewish Chronicle that her aides had instructed Ms. Patel not to include one of her meetings on a list of such contacts that she published on Monday, in an effort to close out the gathering crisis.For Mrs. May, the episode has been a particular headache because Ms. Patel is a passionate supporter of Brexit within a cabinet that was constructed carefully to balance views on Europe. Earlier this week, Mrs. May had declared the matter closed after accepting an apology.In the short term, Ms. Patel’s departure has distracted attention from calls for the resignation of Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, whose inaccurate  comments may have worsened the plight of a British woman who is imprisoned in Iran.Only last week, Mr. Fallon resigned as defense secretary amid a swirling series of allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior among lawmakers that threatens more trouble for Mrs. May.The Cabinet Office is investigating claims made against two more of Mrs. May’s ministers, including Damian Green, a close ally and friend, and effectively Mrs. May’s deputy.After losing her majority in June in an election she need never have called, Mrs. May has never recovered her authority over a cabinet that has clashed over Brexit policy.There are big tests to come for a government in such disarray. Later this month the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, will deliver a keenly awaited budget speech that is now fraught with political danger.Mr. Hammond leads the cabinet faction that wants to soften the impact of Brexit, and to protect the economy by negotiating a standstill transition, under which Britain would apply current rules for two years after its departure from the bloc in March 2019.That has exposed him to attacks from hard-line supporters of Brexit, who want a clean break from the European Union, and some right-wing critics want Mrs. May to fire Mr. Hammond for being insufficiently optimistic about Brexit.Mrs. May faces an even bigger challenge in unlocking stalled negotiations over Brexit, before a summit meeting next month with European Union leaders. To do so, Mrs. May will soon need to indicate that Britain would pay the bloc significantly more to settle outstanding commitments to the European Union than the roughly 20 billion euros she has so far suggested.Such an offer could prove highly controversial within her cabinet, which is divided over the need to soften the impact on the economy of Britain’s departure. Yet failure to offer billions more could mean that European leaders refuse to start talks on a transition after Brexit, and on permanent new trading arrangements.Dissatisfaction with Mrs. May’s inability to stay ahead of events is growing. Last month, a Conservative Party lawmaker, Grant Shapps, sought — and failed — to orchestrate an internal coup against Mrs. May, claiming that he had the support of 30 colleagues who wanted the prime minister to step aside.Under the party’s internal rules, it would take 48 Tory lawmakers to force a leadership contest. The events of the last week may have swollen that group of discontented Conservatives.Fortunately for Mrs. May, her critics have yet to unite around a candidate to succeed her.', "                                    File photo - A Facebook logo on an Ipad is reflected among source code on the LCD screen of a computer, in this photo illustration taken in Sarajevo June 18, 2014.

Now 10 Democrats belonging to the Congressional Progressive Caucus are trying to give terrorist leaders yet another reason for using young people to murder even more innocent civilians.Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., introduced legislation Nov. 14 – co-sponsored by nine other Democrats – calling on the State Department to “prevent United States tax dollars from supporting the Israeli military’s ongoing detention and mistreatment of Palestinian children.”In a news release about the proposed legislation, McCollum said: “This legislation highlights Israel’s system of military detention of Palestinian children and ensures that no American assistance to Israel supports human rights violations …. Peace can only be achieved by respecting human rights, especially the rights of children. Congress must not turn a blind eye the unjust and ongoing mistreatment of Palestinian children living under Israeli occupation.”It is well established that recruiting and using young Palestinians to wage terror on Israeli civilians is part of the modus operandi of Palestinian terrorist leaders. For decades, members of the radical Palestinian political and religious leadership have been stirring up young people to wage war against the Jews and the Jewish State.This was seen in the gruesome intifada that began in 2000, in which Palestinian teenagers committed dozens of attacks against Jewish Israelis on buses, in cafes and at nightclubs.The new law allows for leniency. The courts can not only postpone the convicted minor’s transfer date from a closed holding facility to prison, but can also shorten or cancel the prison sentence altogether, if warranted by the circumstances.More recently – in what has become known as the “lone-wolf” intifada – children as young as 13 have stabbed Israelis with scissors, screwdrivers and knives.Legislation proposed by the 10 Democrats is titled the Promoting Human Rights by Ending Israeli Military Detention of Palestinian Children Act. The bill does not explicitly define at what age a person moves from childhood to adulthood.While noting that children between the ages of 12 and 17 are held and prosecuted by Israeli military courts, the bill fails to acknowledge that some of the most barbaric terrorist attacks against Jewish Israelis have been committed by Palestinian teens.Consider the terrorist attack that took place over this past summer in Halamish, about an hour outside Jerusalem. A Palestinian in his late teens – from a nearby village controlled by the Palestinian Authority – chose a Jewish house at random and fatally stabbed three members of a family as they ate their Sabbath dinner.The Palestinian “child” murderer also wounded several other family members, while one mother hid her young children in an upstairs room until the terrorist left.The triple-murder is reminiscent of a similar attack that occurred only six years earlier when two Palestinian teens armed with knives broke into the Fogel family home in Itamar as they slept on Friday night. The “children” butchered the mother, father and three of their children – including a 3-month-old baby as she slept in her crib.As a result of such deadly terrorist attacks by Palestinian teenagers, Israel has had to introduce legislation to deal with the problem. In August 2016, the Israeli parliament (Knesset) passed a bill allowing imprisonment of terrorists as young as 12.The new law allows for leniency. The courts can not only postpone the convicted minor’s transfer date from a closed holding facility to prison, but can also shorten or cancel the prison sentence altogether, if warranted by the circumstances.In introducing the bill, Knesset Member Anat Berko said: “This law was born of necessity. We have been experiencing a wave of terror for quite some time. A society is allowed to protect itself. To those who are murdered with a knife in the heart it does not matter if the child is 12 or 15. We’ve witnessed numerous cases where 11-year-old children were suicide bombers. Perhaps this law will also do something to protect these children from being used to slaughter people.”In a desperate effort to justify her proposed legislation, Rep. McCollum argued that “peace can only be achieved by respecting human rights, especially the rights of children.”McCollum’s hypocrisy in this context is palpable. She claims to be an advocate for “the rights of children.” Yet she refuses to acknowledge or condemn Palestinians who perpetrate acts of child abuse by recruiting children to commit terrorist attacks on Jews.McCollum expressed no outrage when Palestinian leaders were caught posting material on social media inciting and encouraging young Palestinians to stab Israelis.And the Minnesota member of Congress failed to protest when Hamas set up training camps – under the mantra “Vanguards of Liberation” – aimed at training children as young as 15 to use weapons against Israel. Nor did she speak up when children in Gaza were crushed to death when the terror tunnels they were recruited by the Hamas leadership to build collapsed on their bodies. So I ask: What do these members of Congress think Israel should do? If children as young as 13 were roaming the streets of New York, Los Angeles or Boston stabbing elderly women as they shopped at the supermarket or waited at a bus stop, would the Democrats protest the apprehension and prosecution of the perpetrators? Of course not.No country in the world would tolerate terror in its cities, regardless of the age of the terrorists.Israel has a right – according to international law – to protect its citizens from constant terror attacks, including those committed by young Palestinians. It actually has an obligation to do so.If Israel is punished for trying to protect its citizens from teen terrorists, this would incentivize terrorist leaders to keep using children in pursuit of their goal of wiping the Israel off the map.But rather than condemning the abhorrent and unlawful use of children as terrorist pawns, the 10 congressional Democrats chose to single out Israel for punishment.People of good faith on both sides of the aisle should call out this double standard for what it really is: an attack on Jewish victims of teenage terrorism and the Jewish State.For Shame on this group of biased anti-Israel Democrats, which includes the following members of Congress: Mark Pocan of Wisconsin; Earl Blumenauer of Oregon: André Carson of Indiana: John Conyers of Michigan; Danny K. Davis of Illinois; Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon; Raul Grijalva and Luis V. Gutiérrez of Arizona; and Chellie Pingree of Maine.

He then declined to comment, saying only that "my position on this plan will be determined according to Israel\'s security and national interests."Trump took office with hopes of forging what he calls the "ultimate deal" between Israelis and Palestinians.The last round of peace talks collapsed in 2014.', 'Review: In ‘Roman J. Israel, Esq.,’ Denzel Washington as a Lawyer Out of His Element - The New York TimesPartly because of economics, partly because of a lack of imagination, Hollywood barely makes character-driven movies anymore. So there is a sense in which “Roman J. Israel, Esq.,” a wildly idiosyncratic drama about a wildly idiosyncratic lawyer, deserves not only critical leniency, but also maybe your investment.Yet this film doesn’t do the cause many favors. It certainly doesn’t serve Denzel Washington, in a role unlike any he has played that nevertheless saddles him with a collection of tics meant to compensate for the underrealized complexity of the part. And it offers tonal whiplash for viewers, with several potentially great ideas that don’t settle into a coherent whole. The movie starts in the vein of a ruthlessly intelligent drama like “Michael Clayton” before racing through adversity, running a couple of unearned victory laps and landing just shy of a mawkish Will Smith vehicle like “Seven Pounds.”The film was written and directed by Dan Gilroy, whose “Nightcrawler” centered on Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a monomaniacal cameraman whose lack of a moral compass allowed him to succeed in local television news. Roman Israel (Mr. Washington) is equally single-minded in his pursuits, but otherwise he’s Lou’s opposite: a hapless striver whose compulsions interfere with his ambitions.Roman keeps to his office in a small Los Angeles firm. He is a whiz with briefs and apparently knows the legal code by number, but his partner is always the one who appears in court, having more tolerance for what Roman calls the “butchery” of plea deals and excessive sentences. When the partner has a heart attack, Roman, who can’t run the firm alone or stop himself from talking back to a judge, eventually takes a job with George Pierce (Colin Farrell), a high-flying lawyer who doesn’t necessarily share Roman’s ideals.A veteran social reformer with a dated hairstyle and glasses that only exaggerate his awkwardness, Roman is almost certainly somewhere on the autism spectrum. In a performance that’s meant to grate, Mr. Washington highlights the character’s difficulty making eye contact and his habit of laughing and smiling with too much emphasis. As intriguing as it is to watch a movie about someone who is gifted yet hamstrung by his own mind, you do wonder whether — after Roman and Lou — Mr. Gilroy is capable of writing protagonists who aren’t so affectedly at odds with their environments.The fish-out-of-water clash at the firm is absorbing enough, but the movie misfires when it appoints Roman as a sort of an angelic figure (or, as his last name may signal, a prophet). Carmen Ejogo appears as a younger civil rights advocate who, unlike the other activists we meet from her generation, recognizes Roman’s past contributions and explains that she feels privileged to know him. Roman even begins to grow on George, who inexplicably warms to him just as Roman is wreaking havoc at the firm. And when Roman makes not one but two symbolic getaways — one to Santa Monica, one to the desert — “Roman J. Israel, Esq.” seems like a movie that has no idea where it’s heading.While “Nightcrawler” delivered its bludgeoning lecture on TV sensationalism about four decades too late, “Roman J.

Mr. Gilroy, perhaps similarly caught between integrity and commercial calculation, gets as lost as his hero.', 'Israel Endorsed Kurdish Independence. Saladin Would Have Been Proud. - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — With a two-sentence statement supporting the Iraqi Kurds’ plan to hold a referendum on independence this Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put Israel at odds with nearly every other major player in the Middle East.Mr. Netanyahu, who endorsed not only the referendum but also the establishment of a Kurdish state, had ample strategic reason: A breakaway Kurdistan could prove valuable to Israel against Iran, which has oppressed its own Kurdish population.But given the interwoven history and shared emotion underlying his statement, present-day geopolitics can seem almost beside the point.The Kurds and the Jews, it turns out, go way back.Back past the Babylonian Captivity, in fact: The first Jews in Kurdistan, tradition holds, were among the last tribes of Israel, taken from their land in the eighth century B.C. They liked it there so much that when Cyrus the Great of Persia conquered the Babylonians and let the Jews go back home, many chose instead to stick around.Sixteen centuries later, Saladin, a Kurd, treated the Jews humanely after he conquered Jerusalem, and notably hired a Jewish doctor, Maimonides, as his physician.In the modern era, Kurdish Jews departed en masse for Israel when the Jewish state was created in 1948, leaving Kurdish civil society so bereft that some recall its leaders still lamenting the Jewish exodus decades later.Ties between the two have only grown warmer and more vital since the 1960s, as Israel and the Kurds — both minorities in an inhospitable region and ever in need of international allies — have repeatedly come to each other’s aid. The Kurds have long patterned their lobbying efforts in Washington on those of Israel’s supporters.And while Kurdish leaders have not publicly embraced Israel in the run-up to the referendum, for fear of antagonizing the Arab world, the Israeli flag can routinely be seen at Kurdish rallies in Erbil and across Europe.The Kurds in turn have friends and supporters all across Israel, including some 200,000 Kurdish Jews. But 83-year-old Tzuri Sagi, a retired brigadier general, has more reason than most Israelis to root for Kurdish independence.In the winter of 1966, Mr. Sagi’s commanders sent him on a secret mission, via Israel’s then-ally, Iran, to aid Mullah Mustafa Barzani and his pesh merga rebels in Iraqi Kurdistan. Six Iraqi army brigades were standing by to overwhelm the Kurds when the snow melted. Mr. Sagi, a lieutenant colonel, drew up defenses for Barzani’s lightly armed fighters. When those collapsed, Mr. Sagi advised the Kurds to allow the best of the Iraqi brigades to break out — right into an ambush.The 5,000-man Iraqi brigade was wiped out, and the battle, on Mount Handrin, became a landmark in Kurdish history. Mr. Sagi recalls Iraqi officers driving up in two jeeps waving white flags.“They said to the Kurds, ‘What do you want?’” he recalled.Over the years, Israeli doctors set up a field hospital for the Kurds, its soldiers trained the pesh merga fighters and the Mossad helped arm them.After Israel’s defeat of its Arab neighbors in 1967 and the Baathist coup in Iraq a year later, Iraq became inhospitable to its dwindling Jewish population. Then it was the Barzanis’ turn to help.After nine Jews were hanged in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square in 1969, Iraqi Jews were desperate to flee. The Kurds helped some 1,000 of them escape, over land to Iran and then by plane to Israel.“They were going on donkeys, through the mountains,” said Ofra Bengio, a pre-eminent historian of the Kurds and professor emerita at Tel Aviv University’s Moshe Dayan Center.One of the escapees was Zamir Shemtov, 63, now a dentist in Herzliya, who was a teenager in 1970 when his parents and extended family made their first attempt to flee Iraq. Arrested and locked up for a month, they tried again, but this time they were blackmailed, robbed, caught by the army and sent back to Baghdad, where his father was brutally interrogated, Mr. Shemtov said. Released two months later, they tried to get out a third time. This time, a Kurdish taxi driver ushered them to a safe meeting point where a young uniformed Kurdish fighter loaded them in his jeep and ferried them across the border into Iran.Mr. Shemtov said that near the end of the drive, his father offered the fighter his gold watch in gratitude.“The young man answered, ‘I am Masoud Barzani, son of Mullah Barzani, and if Mullah would hear that I took a watch, he would hang me!’” Mr. Shemtov recalled. “‘Instead, all I ask as thanks is that you remember us well in the future.’”A few years later, the young Masoud Barzani succeeded his father as head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party. Since 2005, he has been president of Iraqi Kurdistan.Mr. Sagi, who returned to aid the pesh merga against Iraq in 1974, said he traveled around Kurdistan quite a bit in those years, posing as a British journalist despite what can generously be called a tenuous command of English. “Sometimes I would tease the Kurds, and say negative things about Israel,” he said. “It always made them angry. They’d say that Israelis and the Jews are the best in the region.”Mr. Sagi said such sentiments stirred a reciprocal feeling in him: “I became a patriotic Kurd.”He was not alone: The story goes that Israeli soldiers and Mossad agents wept when the shah of Iran double-crossed the Kurds by signing the Algiers Accord with Iraq, a 1975 resolution of border disputes that ended the Kurdish rebellion and forced the pesh merga to retreat into Iran.Today, as the Kurds take a step they hope will realize a national dream of an independent state, they have been increasingly isolated.Iraqis oppose the Kurdish referendum because they want to keep their country intact. Iran and Turkey fear it will escalate separatist ambitions among their Kurdish minorities. And a coalition of powers, along with the United Nations Security Council, fear the referendum could disrupt military efforts to defeat the Islamic State.But Mr. Netanyahu had little to lose from his endorsement of the referendum, experts say.“Israel is desperate for friends in the region, the Kurds generally want to be friends, and they don’t care about Palestine,” said Kenneth M. Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst and National Security Council official who visits Kurdistan frequently.Moreover, Israel stands to gain a potentially valuable ally in its struggle with Iran, he said.“Iraqi and Iranian Kurds have deep ties,” he said. “And to create trouble for Iran, one way is to encourage independence for Iranian Kurds. The Iranians are terrified and furious about exactly that: that the Israelis are doing it, and that an independent Kurdistan will be a base for Israeli operations against Iran, via Iran’s Kurdish population.”While United States policy is to try to preserve Iraq as one entity, the Israelis are more practical, said Peter W. Galbraith, a former diplomat with extensive experience in Kurdistan: “Why lose all of Iraq, when you could save part of it?”At bottom, though, analysts and ordinary Israelis alike seem invariably to land on moral and emotional arguments for supporting the Kurds, often sounding much like Mr. Shemtov, the Iraqi-born dentist.“Our two nations have fought against all odds when those surrounding us wanted to destroy us,” he said. “From my perspective, if there is a lone sign of light in Islam, it is the Kurds.”He says he owes his life to them.“They saved us,” he said. “My dream now is that they declare independence, and I come to Erbil and salute while their anthem plays.”', "Acting director of U.S. Homeland Security, Elaine Duke, orders federal agencies to create a plan to remove all software from Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky LabIsraeli intelligence officers watched Russian hackers use software from Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab to search for U.S. secrets, the New York Times reports.The hackers reportedly searched computers across the globe for the code names of U.S. intelligence programs.Citing current and former government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, the report says that Israeli officials who had hacked into Kaspersky’s network alerted their U.S. counterparts. The intrusion, which was detected more than two years ago, prompted the U.S. Government’s recent decision to ditch Kaspersky Lab software, the Times said.DHS vs. KASPERSKY LAB: WHY THE US GOVERNMENT IS DITCHING THE RUSSIAN SOFTWARE GIANTThe Russian operation reportedly stole classified documents from a NSA employee. The documents were improperly stored on the employee’s home computer, on which Kaspersky Lab software was installed, according to the New York Times.The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Russian hackers used Kaspersky Lab software installed on a NSA contractor’s computer to steal sensitive information. However, the role of Israeli intelligence in uncovering that intrusion and Russian hackers’ broader use of Kaspersky software in the search for U.S. secrets was not previously known, the New York Times said.The NSA declined to comment on this story when contacted by Fox News.RUSSIAN CYBERSECURITY FIRM KASPERSKY LAB A 'DANGER' TO US SECURITY, SENATOR WARNSLast month the Department of Homeland Security banned federal agencies and departments from using Kaspersky Lab products, citing national security concerns. U.S. officials, who alleged ties between the company and Russian intelligence, gave American government agencies and departments 90 days to get rid of Kaspersky Lab software.Kaspersky Lab has repeatedly denied the allegations that its products are a threat to U.S. national security, a message it reiterated following the New York Times report. “Kaspersky Lab was not involved in and does not possess any knowledge of the situation in question,” it said, in a statement emailed to Fox News. “As the integrity of our products is fundamental to our business, Kaspersky Lab patches any vulnerabilities it identifies or that are reported to the company.”“Kaspersky Lab reiterates its willingness to work alongside U.S. authorities to address any concerns they may have about its products as well as its systems, and respectfully requests any relevant, verifiable information that would help the company in its own investigation to certifiably refute the false accusations,” it added.ISRAEL SECURITY CHIEF: TECH PREVENTED MORE THAN 2,000 'LONE-WOLF' TERROR ATTACKS LAST YEARThe Russian and Israeli governments have not yet responded to a request for comment on this story from Fox News.Attention is now focused on a mysterious 2015 cyberattack on Kaspersky Lab. A report released by the company in June of that year described the attack as a variant of the existing ‘Duqu’ malware, which it dubbed ‘Duqu 2.0’. While Kasperky Lab’s report made no reference to Israel, security experts have drawn comparisons between Duqu and the Stuxnet worm that crippled Iran's nuclear production in 2010. The U.S. and Israel have been linked to the development of Stuxnet.“With regards to unverified assertions that this situation relates to Duqu2, a sophisticated cyber-attack of which Kaspersky Lab was not the only target, we are confident that we have identified and removed all of the infections that happened during that incident,” said Kaspersky Lab, in its statement emailed to Fox News. “Kaspersky Lab publicly reported the attack, and the company offered its assistance to affected or interested organizations to help mitigate this threat.”US, EUROPEAN ENERGY FIRMS TARGETED BY SHADOWY CYBER ESPIONAGE GROUP, EXPERTS WARNNonetheless, the New York Times report of “spies watching spies watching spies” keeps Kaspersky Lab firmly in the cybersecurity spotlight at a time when U.S. lawmakers are closely scrutinizing the Russian company.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H, has been a vocal critic of federal government’s use of Kaspersky Lab products. Following the Wall Street Journal report last week, Shaheen wrote a letter to the leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee requesting a hearing on the matter.Shaheen is a member of the Armed Services Committee.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", 'How Israel Caught Russian Hackers Scouring the World for U.S. Secrets - The New York TimesIt was a case of spies watching spies watching spies: Israeli intelligence officers looked on in real time as Russian government hackers searched computers around the world for the code names of American intelligence programs.What gave the Russian hacking, detected more than two years ago, such global reach was its improvised search tool — antivirus software made by a Russian company, Kaspersky Lab, that is used by 400 million people worldwide, including by officials at some two dozen American government agencies.The Israeli officials who had hacked into Kaspersky’s own network alerted the United States to the broad Russian intrusion, which has not been previously reported, leading to a decision just last month to order Kaspersky software removed from government computers.The Russian operation, described by multiple people who have been briefed on the matter, is known to have stolen classified documents from a National Security Agency employee who had improperly stored them on his home computer, on which Kaspersky’s antivirus software was installed. What additional American secrets the Russian hackers may have gleaned from multiple agencies, by turning the Kaspersky software into a sort of Google search for sensitive information, is not yet publicly known.The current and former government officials who described the episode spoke about it on condition of anonymity because of classification rules.Like most security software, Kaspersky Lab’s products require access to everything stored on a computer in order to scour it for viruses or other dangers. Its popular antivirus software scans for signatures of malicious software, or malware, then removes or neuters it before sending a report back to Kaspersky. That procedure, routine for such software, provided a perfect tool for Russian intelligence to exploit to survey the contents of computers and retrieve whatever they found of interest.The National Security Agency and the White House declined to comment for this article. The Israeli Embassy declined to comment, and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Russian hackers had stolen classified N.S.A. materials from a contractor using the Kaspersky software on his home computer. But the role of Israeli intelligence in uncovering that breach and the Russian hackers’ use of Kaspersky software in the broader search for American secrets have not previously been disclosed.Kaspersky Lab denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Russian hacking. “Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,” the company said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. Kaspersky Lab also said it “respectfully requests any relevant, verifiable information that would enable the company to begin an investigation at the earliest opportunity.”The Kaspersky-related breach is only the latest bad news for the security of American intelligence secrets. It does not appear to be related to a devastating leak of N.S.A. hacking tools last year to a group, still unidentified, calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which has placed many of them online. Nor is it evidently connected to a parallel leak of hacking data from the C.I.A. to WikiLeaks, which has posted classified C.I.A. documents regularly under the name Vault7.For years, there has been speculation that Kaspersky’s popular antivirus software might provide a back door for Russian intelligence. More than 60 percent, or $374 million, of the company’s $633 million in annual sales come from customers in the United States and Western Europe. Among them have been nearly two dozen American government agencies — including the State Department, the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Justice Department, Treasury Department and the Army, Navy and Air Force.The N.S.A. bans its analysts from using Kaspersky antivirus at the agency, in large part because the agency has exploited antivirus software for its own foreign hacking operations and knows the same technique is used by its adversaries.“Antivirus is the ultimate back door,” Blake Darché, a former N.S.A. operator and co-founder of Area 1 Security. “It provides consistent, reliable and remote access that can be used for any purpose, from launching a destructive attack to conducting espionage on thousands or even millions of users.”On Sept. 13, the Department of Homeland Security ordered all federal executive branch agencies to stop using Kaspersky products, giving agencies 90 days to remove the software. Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine C. Duke cited the “information security risks” presented by Kaspersky and said the company’s antivirus and other software “provide broad access to files” and “can be exploited by malicious cyber actors to compromise” federal computer systems.That directive, which some officials thought was long overdue, was based, in large part, on intelligence gleaned from Israel’s 2014 intrusion into Kaspersky’s corporate systems. It followed months of discussions among intelligence officials, which included a study of how Kaspersky’s software works and the company’s suspected ties with the Kremlin.“The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky,” D.H.S. said in its statement, “could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.”Kaspersky Lab did not discover the Israeli intrusion into its systems until mid-2015, when a Kaspersky engineer testing a new detection tool noticed unusual activity in the company’s network. The company investigated and detailed its findings in June 2015 in a public report.The report did not name Israel as the intruder but noted that the breach bore striking similarities to a previous attack, known as “Duqu,” which researchers had attributed to the same nation states responsible for the infamous Stuxnet cyberweapon. Stuxnet was a joint American-Israeli operation that successfully infiltrated Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility, and used malicious code to destroy a fifth of Iran’s uranium centrifuges in 2010.Kaspersky reported that its attackers had used the same algorithm and some of the same code as Duqu, but noted that in many ways it was even more sophisticated. So the company researchers named the new attack Duqu 2.0, noting that other victims of the attack were prime Israeli targets.Among the targets Kaspersky uncovered were hotels and conference venues used for closed-door meetings by members of the United Nations Security Council to negotiate the terms of the Iran nuclear deal — negotiations from which Israel was excluded. Several targets were in the United States, which suggested that the operation was Israel’s alone, not a joint American-Israeli operation like Stuxnet.Kaspersky’s researchers noted that attackers had managed to burrow deep into the company’s computers and evade detection for months. Investigators later discovered that the Israeli hackers had implanted multiple back doors into Kaspersky’s systems, employing sophisticated tools to steal passwords, take screenshots, and vacuum up emails and documents.In its June 2015 report, Kaspersky noted that its attackers seemed primarily interested in the company’s work on nation-state attacks, particularly Kaspersky’s work on the “Equation Group” — its private industry term for the N.S.A. — and the “Regin” campaign, another industry term for a hacking unit inside the United Kingdom’s intelligence agency, the Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ.Israeli intelligence officers informed the N.S.A. that in the course of their Kaspersky hack, they uncovered evidence that Russian government hackers were using Kaspersky’s access to aggressively scan for American government classified programs, and pulling any findings back to Russian intelligence systems. They provided their N.S.A. counterparts with solid evidence of the Kremlin campaign in the form of screenshots and other documentation, according to the people briefed on the events.It is not clear whether, or to what degree, Eugene V. Kaspersky, the founder of Kaspersky Lab, and other company employees have been complicit in the hacking using their products. Technical experts say that at least in theory, Russian intelligence hackers could have exploited Kaspersky’s worldwide deployment of software and sensors without the company’s cooperation or knowledge. Another possibility is that Russian intelligence officers might have infiltrated the company without the knowledge of its executives.But experts on Russia say that under President Vladimir V. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, businesses asked for assistance by Russian spy agencies may feel they have no choice but to give it. To refuse might well invite hostile action from the government against the business or its leaders. Mr. Kaspersky, who attended an intelligence institute and served in Russia’s Ministry of Defense, would have few illusions about the cost of refusing a Kremlin request.Steven L. Hall, a former chief of Russian operations at the C.I.A., said his former agency never used Kaspersky software, but other federal agencies did. By 2013, he said, Kaspersky officials were “trying to do damage control and convince the U.S. government that it was just another security company.”He didn’t buy it, Mr. Hall said. “I had the gravest concerns about Kaspersky, and anyone who worked on Russia or in counterintelligence shared those concerns,” he said.', 'Trump’s Move Departs From U.N. Resolutions on Jerusalem - The New York TimesPresident Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel not only upends decades of American policy. It also appears to put the United States at odds with the United Nations Security Council.The 15-member council has adopted a number of resolutions, dating back 50 years, aimed in part at preventing Israel from claiming sovereignty over all of the holy city.That could make for awkward diplomatic dynamics on the council, where none of the other members share Mr. Trump’s position on Jerusalem.Eight members, including Britain, France and Italy, allies of the United States, have called for an emergency meeting of the council on Friday to discuss Mr. Trump’s declaration.Many supporters of Israel have long accused the United Nations of bias against it, a criticism that the United States ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, has echoed and vowed to change.As Israel’s strongest ally at the United Nations, the United States often has used its veto power to block Security Council resolutions critical of Israel. But there have been exceptions, including for resolutions concerning the status of Jerusalem.Here are some notable examples of resolutions that the United States supported or did not block with a veto:Resolution 242, Nov. 22, 1967: Israel was told to withdraw forces from territories occupied in the 1967 war, which included the eastern part of Jerusalem.Resolution 252, May 21, 1968: Israel was told to rescind “actions that tend to change the status of Jerusalem,” including the expropriation of land and property.Resolution 465, March 1, 1980: Israel was warned to stop settlement construction and to disband existing settlements in territories occupied in the 1967 war, including Jerusalem. Such acts, the resolution said, amounted to “a flagrant violation” of the Geneva Convention’s protections of civilians in wartime.Resolution 478, Aug. 20, 1980: Israel was censured for having enacted a law declaring a change in the status of Jerusalem, which “constitutes a violation of international law.” Countries that had established diplomatic missions in the city were called upon to remove them.Resolution 672, Oct. 12, 1990: During the first intifada, or Palestinian uprising, Israel was called “the occupying power” in Jerusalem and was condemned over the deaths of more than 20 Palestinians in violence at holy sites in the city on Oct. 8.Resolution 1073, Sept. 28, 1996: Israel was warned about archeological tunneling near Jerusalem’s holiest site, revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. Palestinians were enraged at what they viewed as a sacrilege.Resolution 1322, Oct. 7, 2000: Israel was condemned over deadly violence arising from a visit to the Temple Mount by Ariel Sharon, then the Israeli opposition leader, which the resolution described as a “provocation” that had led to the deaths of more than 80 Palestinians.Resolution 1397, March 12, 2002: Both sides were called upon to halt violence and re-engage in peace talks with the goal of a two-state solution, “side by side within secure and recognized borders.” The resolution called on both sides to adopt recommendations of a fact-finding committee, led by the former senator George J. Mitchell, that included a freeze on Israeli settlements and cooperation to protect holy sites in Jerusalem and elsewhere.Resolution 2334, Dec. 23, 2016: Israel was condemned for settlement construction in occupied territories including East Jerusalem. The settlement construction “has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution,” the resolution said.', 'How Did ‘Peace’ Become a Dirty Word in Israel? - The New York TimesOn Saturday night, tens of thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv’s main public square, as they do every Nov. 4, to remember the man who was murdered in that spot in 1995 and whose name the square carries: Yitzhak Rabin.But even though more than two decades have passed since the Saturday when Mr. Rabin, who was then the prime minister, was shot and killed, Israelis have still not recovered from the trauma.In the weeks before this year’s rally in Mr. Rabin’s memory, there was a debate over the former prime minister’s true legacy and the proper way to commemorate his assassination. (In fact, this debate has become something of annual Israeli tradition.)Mr. Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish fanatic who opposed his government’s peace policy with the Palestinians. In the early 1990s, Mr. Rabin began a process of negotiations with the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat that resulted in the Palestinian Authority taking over some of the West Bank.For that reason, there are many Israelis — supporters of the peace process on the left — who expect Mr. Rabin’s annual memorials to reflect his quest for peace. On the other hand, Mr. Rabin was the prime minister of all Israelis, including the many who opposed his policies. These Israelis expect a memorial to Mr. Rabin to be sober and unified, a call for civility and a denunciation of political extremism — not a political event in support of the policies they still oppose.The debate was especially fierce this year because the organizers of the event — the Commanders for Israel’s Security and the Darkenu movement, both of which call for separation of Israel from the Palestinians — decided to hold the event under the theme “We Remember: We are One People.” In promoting the rally, they initially avoided the words “murder” and “peace” — and the list of speakers included Israelis who were fierce opponents of Mr. Rabin’s policies.The left was furious, accusing the organizers — as one member of the Knesset from the Labor Party put it — of presenting the rally as if Mr. Rabin had “died peacefully in his bed” rather than been killed by a right-wing extremist.Why would the organizers want to take “peace” out of the rally? Their reasoning was solid: The more the commemoration was about Mr. Rabin’s controversial policies, the less it would unify Israelis. So they made a choice: eliminate the “peace” to gain the participation of the right wing, which opposes the peace process prescribed by Mr. Rabin and his followers on the left who want to see Israel’s settlements in the West Bank withdrawn.It was the right choice. It was also a troubling one.Most Israelis haven’t believed in peace for a long time. And by “peace” in this context, I mean what Mr. Rabin wanted: a concrete and stable peace with their Palestinian neighbors. Most Israelis still support negotiations for peace, but only a small minority believes that negotiations will lead to peace “in the coming years.” As a realistic goal, peace is out of fashion, and for good reasons: Both Israelis and Palestinians refuse to make the compromises necessary for a lasting peace.But it’s one thing to realistically assess that peace is not coming anytime soon, and quite another to forgo the ideal of peace. It is one thing to realize that holding a politically charged rally is not a good way to preserve Mr. Rabin’s memory, and it’s quite another to act as though mentioning a desire for peace in the public square is unacceptable.How has “peace” become such a politically charged term? Jews include the word “shalom,” or peace, in their daily prayers; they use the word as a greeting regularly. But in the political arena, many Israelis are no longer willing to say that peace is their goal for their country, because they fear that saying so will make them sound fainthearted or deluded or — God forbid! — like leftists.Israelis have developed two strategies as they shun the politically poisonous word “peace.” The right generally avoids the subject entirely. Since it believes peace is not a realistic goal, there is nothing to talk about. For its part, the left has replaced “peace” with more technical terms, like “separation” or “political settlement.” This is the way for leftist leaders to indicate to their base that peace is still their goal, while not scaring away potential voters who are skeptical.Both these strategies make sense, and both make Israel a lesser place.The Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel proclaims: “We extend our hand to all neighboring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighborliness.” Indeed, peace with Israel’s neighbors is an ideal that our leaders have never abandoned. “Israel never ceased to call for a true peace of mutual respect between our neighbors and ourselves,” said Prime Minister Golda Meir of the Labor Party in 1969. In 1978, upon receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for Israel’s peace accords with Egypt, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of the Likud Party said that there is “no mission in life more sacred” than working for peace.Our leaders should go back to this habit of reminding Israel and the world that Israel’s goal is peace. “Peace” should be a usable, mainstream word, and an aspiration that everyone shares.That won’t be easy. The left has gotten used to using “peace” — whether by this name or by other uninspiring euphemisms — as a weapon against the right. The right has gotten used to using “peace” as weapon against the left, which, they say, chases a pipe dream. But peace shouldn’t be a political weapon for either side. It should be an ideal and a goal dear to all Israelis who remember Mr. Rabin’s murder with horror and sorrow.', 'Why Won’t Israel Let Me Mourn My Father? - The New York TimesMy father, Azzam Jarrar, died last month. He was a proud Palestinian, a refugee, a civil engineer, a farmer and an entrepreneur. He was also my friend and mentor. He taught me the multiplication tables on our way to school in Saudi Arabia. He taught me how to question authority when we lived in Iraq. He helped me finish my master’s degree when I lived in Jordan. Above all, though, he was the gateway to my Palestinian roots and identity.My dad fled his home with his family in 1967, when Israeli soldiers invaded and occupied the West Bank. He went first to Jordan and then to Iraq, where I was born. I was the first Jarrar to be born east of the Jordan River since our family was established on Palestinian land centuries ago.I didn’t have the chance to visit my relatives on the West Bank until 2015, when I traveled there for a short work trip while working for a Quaker nongovernmental organization. Being in the diaspora meant that I wasn’t given the opportunity to connect with the land and people. My only connection to my family history was through old stories and a few blurry pictures that my father took with him when he left as a teenager.That’s why, after my father died in Jordan in October, it was so important for me to visit my extended family in the city of Jenin, to mourn his death with them. Unfortunately, I was prevented from doing so by the Israeli government.I had visited Israel, the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip two more times since that first trip in 2015. Like most Palestinian-Americans, I was questioned at the border about my family and personal life for hours before being admitted.My latest visit was different. This time, Israeli officials were mostly interested in my work, even though I made it clear that my partner, Alli McCracken, and I were traveling in our personal capacity to mourn my father and visit my family.I’m the Middle East and North Africa advocacy director for the human rights organization Amnesty International U.S.A. In that capacity, I have played a leading role in a new campaign that seemed to get the Israeli border guards’ attention, a campaign calling on governments to ban goods from Israeli settlements.The officials who questioned me asked why Amnesty has a problem with Israel. I kept trying to steer the conversation back to my dad’s memorial service, but they insisted on discussing the organization’s work. Alli, who also works for Amnesty International, was questioned for a long time, too. They took her phone and went through her text messages.After hours of back and forth, I was informed that I was being denied entry for reasons of “public order” and — believe it or not — “the prevention of illegal immigration.” I called the American Consulate General in Jerusalem and was told that there was nothing the officials there could do to help.Based on the questions I was asked, I had no doubt that this denial of entry was retaliation for my work. Amnesty International believes Israel’s settlement enterprise amounts to a war crime. Under international law, governments have an obligation not to recognize or assist “illegal situations.” That’s why Amnesty is calling on governments across the world, including the United States, to uphold that law and not allow Israeli businesses to profit from an illegal occupation.Israel seems to have denied me entry under legislation passed in March that bans entry to Israel for noncitizens who knowingly issue “a public call for boycotting Israel.” This law pertains not only to the boycott of goods produced in Israel proper but also to goods produced in settlements. Although Amnesty International calls for a government ban on importing those goods — not a consumer boycott — the Israeli government seems to treat it the same way.Could my teenage dad fleeing his hometown half a century ago have imagined this happening to his son? I wanted to visit his old school and my grandparents’ old house. I wanted to touch the olive trees he climbed as little boy, and eat hareeseh, my favorite Palestinian dessert made of semolina and coconut, from the shop in central Jenin. Does it even exist anymore?I wasn’t just upset about missing my dad’s memorial service. Before I left the United States, I told my 4-year-old son that I was going on a trip because his grandpa had died. He cried a lot. Then he asked me if we could plant his grandfather back in earth like a plant and wait until he grows back. I told him we couldn’t. He said he would just use his imagination. I tried to use my imagination while I was being sent back from the border crossing — I tried to imagine my family’s land that I couldn’t plant my father back into.When I returned home, my son asked me about the trip, and I had to tell him that I wasn’t able to go. He looked confused. I couldn’t explain the details — my work, Israel’s settlements and the occupation, its unjust laws that stifle civil society. I know I’ll have to tell him about all that someday.It won’t be an easy story to tell, not only because of the Israeli government’s actions but also because of the United States government’s lack of action. Although I’ve tried to follow up, my own government has not stepped in to protect my right to equal treatment, and yet continues to help sustain illegal settlements by allowing the flood of Israeli goods into American markets.Israel must respect my right, and the rights of others, to engage in peaceful human rights work without fear of reprisal. Whether or not the Israeli government agrees with my work — and, of course, I know it doesn’t — I still should have been able to take part in those most human of activities: mourning my father and celebrating his life.', 'Nine Women Accuse Israel Horovitz, Playwright and Mentor, of Sexual Misconduct - The New York TimesIn 1986, Maddie Corman was a 16-year-old actress performing Off Broadway as her mother lay dying in a hospital bed, hours after having a stroke. Backstage, Ms. Corman was consoled by Israel Horovitz, the show’s 47-year-old playwright and her mentor. As she prepared to go on, he pressed her against a wall and forcefully kissed her, she said in a recent interview.Jocelyn Meinhardt was 19 when she began a summer fellowship in 1989 with Mr. Horovitz at the Gloucester Stage Company in Massachusetts, where he was artistic director. She knew Mr. Horovitz; one of his sons, Adam Horovitz, who would go on to fame with the Beastie Boys, had been her high school boyfriend. That first night, she said, Mr. Horovitz drove her in his convertible — its license plate read AUTHOR — to the family home. He locked the door, then kissed and fondled her. She began to cry. Mr. Horovitz then led her to his bedroom, where she said he raped her.In 1991, when Frédérique Giffard was 16 and an au pair for Mr. Horovitz, she said he groped her breasts and placed her hand on his erect penis. And last year, Maia Ermansons, then 21, said that when she met to discuss a theater project with Mr. Horovitz — whom she had known since she was a girl — he kissed her hard and cupped her breasts, remarking how “large and beautiful” they had become. Stunned, she replied, “Thank you.”“I felt close to him like a grandfather, but also he was a somewhat famous guy whose time I felt privileged to have,” Ms. Ermansons said in an interview. “For the man who represented all that, to treat me the way he did, was the ultimate betrayal.”Inspired by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K. and others, a total of nine women have come forward publicly for the first time to describe a pattern of sexual abuse and violations of trust by a man they considered a mentor and friend. Mr. Horovitz is an award-winning author of more than 70 plays, including “The Indian Wants the Bronx” (starring Al Pacino in 1968); “Park Your Car in Harvard Yard” (on Broadway in 1991); and “Out of the Mouths of Babes,” which ran Off Broadway last year.Over his five-decade career, Mr. Horovitz has been an influential player in the theater world. As the founding artistic director of Gloucester Stage, a respected regional theater that called itself a “safe harbor for playwrights,” and as an Obie-winning writer whose work was produced frequently in New York and Paris, he has had the power to offer roles, jobs or a helping hand to generations of actors.In response to questions this week, Mr. Horovitz, 78, told The New York Times that while he has “a different memory of some of these events, I apologize with all my heart to any woman who has ever felt compromised by my actions, and to my family and friends who have put their trust in me. To hear that I have caused pain is profoundly upsetting, as is the idea that I might have crossed a line with anyone who considered me a mentor.”His son, Adam Horovitz, said in his own statement: “I believe the allegations against my father are true, and I stand behind the women that made them.”Mr. Horovitz’s behavior around women had long been the subject of whispers. But since at least 1993, Gloucester Stage officials had known it was more than mere speculation: that year, Mr. Horovitz was the subject of an exposé in The Boston Phoenix in which 10 women accused him of sexual harassment and assault. The women’s names were not disclosed in the article. At the time the board’s president, Barry Weiner, dismissed the accusations and described some of the women speaking out against Mr. Horovitz as “tightly wound.”Last week, the theater cut ties with Mr. Horovitz after learning of the accusations by Ms. Ermansons.“I apologize to the brave women who came forward in 1992 and 1993 but were not listened to,” Elizabeth Neumeier, the Gloucester board’s current president, said in a statement. “We are individually and collectively appalled by the allegations, both old and new.”The nine women who spoke with The Times described Mr. Horovitz as a complicated man who was, at times, a charismatic mentor and empathic friend. He taught at several universities and nurtured young writers, was generous with his wisdom and dazzled with tales of his famous friends. “He was very dynamic and a real creative force,” said Ms. Corman, the actress.But he also preyed on them, the women said, striking in moments of vulnerability and manipulating his role as director — as auteur — to take advantage of young women who were professionally dependent on him and often working far from home.“He was a good mentor, until he was the worst, probably most nightmarish mentor you could have,” Ms. Meinhardt said.The relationship was complex for Ms. Meinhardt. She said that after she was raped, she continued to work for Mr. Horovitz and went to extreme lengths to avoid being alone with him. But it was impossible: He was her boss. She said she and Mr. Horovitz had sex on two other occasions — consensual, she said, “in that I didn’t say no clearly.” Like some of the other women, she stayed friendly with him for years.The nine women recounted experiences with Mr. Horovitz that had chilling similarities. Each woman’s story was corroborated independently by people in whom they confided.Kathleen Nickels was the subscription manager of the Gloucester theater when she was 21, during the 1985-86 season. There, she said, Mr. Horovitz would corner her when she was in the office alone, kiss and fondle her, and once forced her hand down the front of his pants.Elizabeth Dann and Laura Crook were also in their 20s when they were an actress and an understudy in a 1990 Gloucester production of “Strong-Man’s Weak Child,” which Mr. Horovitz wrote and directed. Along with Kim Senko, the technical director, the women created a “buddy system” to avoid being alone with Mr. Horovitz, who they say harassed them repeatedly. Ms. Senko recounted how he pushed her against a wall in a dark hallway as she locked up the theater and shoved his hand down her pants as he pressed his mouth on hers.Ms. Dann said Mr. Horovitz once advised her to go home, get naked, powder her face white, put red lipstick on and masturbate while she practiced her monologue in the mirror. Another time as they rehearsed the monologue alone, at Mr. Horovitz’s request, he lunged forward, backing Ms. Dann into a wall and forcing his tongue into her mouth. “I said, ‘Oh my god, what are you doing?’ And he said, ‘Oh no no no, respond in character,’” she recalled. The more she spoke up, she said, the more he wielded his power, like putting in her understudy and threatening to replace her with another actor.Jana Mestecky worked for Mr. Horovitz in her 20s between 1994 and 1996, first as an assistant and later a stage manager. She said that Mr. Horovitz would summon her to his house to drop off scripts — then answer the door naked. He kissed her, fondled her and groped her from behind as she worked, she said, often telling her she “wouldn’t get anywhere with such ‘twisted Southern morals.’” (Ms. Mestecky grew up in Alabama.)“I respect Israel immensely,” Ms. Mestecky wrote in a journal entry dated February 1994. “Unfortunately he has fallen, like Icarus, from his pedestal.”For a brief time, it seemed like Mr. Horovitz might face consequences. Prompted by an anonymous note, Bill Marx, a freelance theater critic for The Boston Phoenix, published articles in 1993 about sexual misconduct accusations against Mr. Horovitz from seven actresses and Gloucester staff members and three nannies.Mr. Horovitz called the claims in The Phoenix “character assassination.” The board’s then-president, Mr. Weiner, who is a lawyer, told The Phoenix that he had spoken to several female employees who had talked of unwelcome hugs and kisses by Mr. Horovitz — but that those descriptions did not fit the legal interpretation of sexual harassment. The women, he said, were “tightly wound, if you know what I mean,” adding that such accusations were tossed around “like manhole covers.”In an interview, Mr. Weiner characterized those 1993 comments as “less-than-sensitive.” He recently stepped down from an advisory panel at the Gloucester theater.Mr. Marx, the Phoenix writer, said the story “just seemed to fade away.”“There were some people who just wrote this off as, ‘Oh, he’s just a little too kissy, a little too touchy, this is just show business,’” Mr. Marx said. “No, he was assaulting them.”All of the women interviewed by The Times processed their experiences differently. Ms. Meinhardt wrote a play based on it. Ms. Crook journaled. Ms. Giffard, the au pair (and now a lawyer in Paris) kept copies of the faxes Mr. Horovitz and his wife, Gillian Horovitz, had sent her mother, arranging her return to France. (In one, $92 was requested for the cost of a flight change.)In 2009, Ms. Meinhardt and Ms. Giffard separately confronted Mr. Horovitz about the abuse.“I said, ‘I was 16 and he was 52, and that the whole thing was completely wrong,’” Ms. Giffard said. “He said he hadn’t realized that he had harmed me. He weakly apologized.”Mr. Horovitz continued to gain stature over the years. In honor of his 70th birthday, in 2009, the Barefoot Theater Company in New York organized “The 70/70 Horovitz Project” — a yearlong, worldwide performance of 70 of his plays. In 2014, he made his feature film directorial debut in “My Old Lady,” starring Kevin Kline and Maggie Smith. According to his website, Mr. Horovitz is the most-produced American playwright in French history.But then the Weinstein revelations began. One after the next, the women found themselves typing “Israel Horovitz” into their computers. What they found was Ms. Ermansons, who had written her accusations about Mr. Horovitz on Facebook and Twitter.In the post, Ms. Ermansons said Mr. Horovitz — whom she regarded “as an honorary grandfather” — had “pulled me onto his lap and licked my lips and tried sticking his tongue in my mouth several times.” She said he told her: “No great woman has ever become great by being a good girl.”“I felt frozen,” she said in an interview. “I said, ‘I have a boyfriend,’ and he said, ‘I have a wife.’ And then he sort of looked at me, and he was like, ‘You know I’m doing this for you, right? I’m doing this because I love you Maia, do you know that I love you?’ And it goes on and on. I didn’t know if it was a threat or a proclamation.”A few months later, Ms. Ermansons received a voice mail message from Mr. Horovitz, apologizing for the “terrible, terrible misunderstanding.” She saved it as an MP3.Soon the women began to find one another. They said they have drawn strength, even a measure of peace, by sharing their numbers.And yet there is an element of stolen ambition to it all. Ms. Meinhardt was a dramatic writing student at New York University at the time of the alleged assault. Afterward, she won her class’s senior playwriting award and was the recipient of a prestigious scholarship. But she also struggled with depression and writer’s block.The other women faced different versions of the same. Ms. Mestecky took a year off and moved home. Ms. Nickels left theater altogether. Ms. Dann veered from theater to more commercial work.“I heard a word used recently about people like this — they’re dream crushers,” Ms. Dann said. “He took this thing that was such a beautiful thing, this young hope, this sense of promise, and he just ruined it.”', 'Ehud Barak: We Must Save Israel From Its Government - The New York TimesFor anyone who cares about Israel, this is no time for niceties. What we need now is plain speaking, even pained speaking — and action. For all of Israel’s great achievements in its seven decades of statehood, our country now finds its very future, identity and security severely threatened by the whims and illusions of the ultranationalist government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.In its more than three years in power, this government has been irrational, bordering on messianic. It is now increasingly clear where it is headed: creeping annexation of the West Bank aimed at precluding any permanent separation from the Palestinians.This “one-state solution” that the government is leading Israel toward is no solution at all. It will inevitably turn Israel into a state that is either not Jewish or not democratic (and possibly not either one), mired in permanent violence. This prospect is an existential danger for the entire Zionist project.The government realizes that carrying out its one-state plan must entail steps and practices that necessarily clash with Israeli and international law — which is why it has effectively declared war on the Supreme Court of Israel, the free press and civil society, as well as the Israel Defense Forces’ ethical code.This disrespect for the rule of law permeates other aspects of the government, too. It helps to shield the prime minister, his family and his aides from corruption investigations. Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud Party recently introduced legislation that would explicitly forbid the police from recommending indictments at the end of high-profile investigations. To clear up any question about its intentions, the law would apply even to inquiries that are already open — like the one into the prime minister’s dealings.The same inclination toward self-preservation is evident in Mr. Netanyahu’s capitulation to ultra-Orthodox parties on religious issues, damaging Israel’s crucial relationship with American Jews. That relationship has grown even more strained since Mr. Netanyahu reneged on a deal that would have expanded egalitarian prayer space at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, Judaism’s holiest site. This is a longstanding demand for recognition from Reform and Conservative Jews, who together make up about half of the Jewish-American community.The Middle East is certainly a tough neighborhood. The threats to Israel are real and none can be ignored. Our country, however, has built an “iron wall” of military and economic power that has made us into the strongest player in the region. This accomplishment, together with bipartisan American support, enables Israel to shape its own future.Despite the right-wing government’s actions, there is a broad consensus among Israelis that rests on three pillars. First and foremost, security comes before everything; every Israeli understands this. Second, the unity, solidarity and integrity of the people take priority over the unity of the land — namely, the wish to possess the entirety of our historic homeland. Third, the principles of the 1948 Declaration of Independence, which lay out a vision for a democratic Israel based on freedom, justice and peace, are the foundation of our country’s de facto constitution.These pillars should indicate how to proceed toward peace. Accordingly, the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem and the “settlement blocs” — suburban communities built just across the Green Line, which include some 80 percent of the total settler population — will remain in Israel no matter what. In any future peace agreement, these areas can be offset by land swaps with the Palestinians. Similarly, overall security responsibility in the West Bank will remain in the hands of the Israel Defense Forces as long as necessary.The entire debate, then, is actually only over the fate of the isolated settlements, fewer than 100 small communities deep in the West Bank, containing around 100,000 settlers. Even if it is not possible to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at this stage — and it probably is not — it is obvious that continued construction in those isolated settlements directly damages Israel’s vital interests. The settlements are a security liability, not an asset. They aim to block the option of a “divorce” from the Palestinians, which the overwhelming majority of Israelis support.Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition claims to support the three pillars of Israeli consensus but the truth is it is determinedly undermining all three. The prime minister degrades our security rather than enhancing it. He prefers a Greater Israel with an Arab majority, violence and division over a united, self-confident Israel with a solid Jewish majority, together facing whatever challenges may arise. He sanctifies the Land of Israel before the People of Israel. And he systematically erodes Israel’s democracy and liberal norms of governance.In the service of this agenda, Mr. Netanyahu elevated fake news, alternative facts and whataboutism into art forms in Hebrew, long before those terms gained any traction in English. His government jeopardizes Israel’s very future, while dividing and inciting us against each other and maligning those abroad who genuinely care about Israel. This must be stopped.', 'Is the End of Israeli Democracy Nigh? Israelis Debate Its Future - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — Arabs, peace activists and Israel’s left wing have long challenged as undemocratic the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.But now that criticism is being leveled by former security officials and members of the right-wing establishment itself, including veterans of Mr. Netanyahu’s own political party and his Justice Department.They say that the government’s efforts to control the news media, curtail the authority of the Supreme Court and undermine once-hallowed institutions like the military threaten the future of Israeli democracy. Their warnings have thrown Israel into an impassioned debate over what kind of country it is becoming, and if its democracy — now in its 70th year — can survive.A former chief of Shin Bet, the Israeli domestic security service, wrote in a newspaper column on Monday that if “the ethical and moral rot that leads us” continues, “this incredible Zionist enterprise will expire.”The attorney general has criticized efforts in the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, to thwart corruption investigations against Mr. Netanyahu.Reuven Rivlin, the Israeli president, a largely ceremonial post meant to be above politics, warned that “statesmanship has come to an end” and said Israel was “witnessing the winds of a second revolution or coup.” Mr. Rivlin comes from Mr. Netanyahu’s own party, Likud.Mr. Rivlin’s speech last week, in particular, was widely considered an unprecedented political intervention.“It touched on an exposed nerve of many Israelis,” said Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research center in Jerusalem. “Israelis are committed to Israel remaining a strong and vibrant democracy. However, there is a deep divide on how we interpret what democracy means.”That Mr. Rivlin comes from the same party as Mr. Netanyahu made his rebuke all the more surprising, and drew comparisons with criticism leveled against President Trump by leading Republicans in the United States, including Senators Bob Corker and John McCain and former President George W. Bush.While some see other threats to Israeli democracy stemming from the military occupation of territories captured in the 1967 war, this latest debate is more internal, focusing on democracy within Israel’s pre-1967 boundaries and coming after mounting episodes of what critics called new levels of toxicity and partisanship in the national discourse.There have been political moves to curb the influence of guardians of liberal values, including attacks on the news media, efforts to impose sanctions on human rights organizations deemed to act against Israel abroad, and attempts to advance legislation in Parliament to override decisions of the Supreme Court.In recent months, politicians from Likud have maligned Shin Bet as cowardly and delusional, and branded former security chiefs critical of government policy as “leftists,” now almost a synonym for traitors in some right-wing circles.Many Israelis were outraged when Mr. Netanyahu, who is under investigation in two graft cases, personally attacked the police in a Facebook post, accusing them of leaking details to the press. Continuing efforts by Likud politicians to introduce legislation that would prohibit corruption investigations of a sitting prime minister, apparently tailored for Mr. Netanyahu, have been criticized as “absurd” and “inconceivable” by the attorney general and are causing a public uproar.“We have good reason to be terrified by the ethical and moral rot that leads us,” the former Shin Bet chief, Yuval Diskin, wrote in Monday’s edition of the popular Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.“If we permit corruption to take hold in the Knesset,” he wrote, “to damage the separation of powers in the country and, worst of all, to infiltrate the most sensitive process in a democratic country — which is the process by which our elected officials are investigated — this incredible Zionist enterprise will expire.”Analysts say that the country is locked in a fundamental clash not between left and right but between the values of the founding generation of leaders who put the common good and the interests of the state first and a newer, more populist and partisan politics epitomized by Mr. Netanyahu’s government.Mr. Rivlin, 78, and Mr. Netanyahu, 68, though only a decade apart, reflect these two Israels.Mr. Rivlin champions the old-school nationalist but liberal democracy envisioned by the right-wing Zionist Revisionist movement of Zeev Jabotinsky and Menachem Begin, who pushed for a greater Israel territorially but were sticklers for defending minority rights and the rule of law. Mr. Netanyahu is also a disciple of Mr. Jabotinsky and Mr. Begin, but analysts say he and many of his ministers reflect the brash political populism of the digital age.Mr. Rivlin did not mention Mr. Netanyahu by name but accused those in power of working to delegitimize and weaken “the gatekeepers of Israel’s democracy,” and, crucially for a country that lacks a constitution, erode the justice system and the influence of the courts.Mr. Rivlin, like other critics, accused the government of championing the will of the majority while weakening the institutions that protect the rights of the minority.“We are today witnessing the winds of a second revolution or coup,” he said. The first one, which he said he also opposed, was a decision by the Supreme Court in the 1990s to overturn laws that contradicted Israel’s Basic Laws. “This time,” he said, “it is the rule of the majority that is the sole ruler.”Declaring that “statesmanship has come to an end here,” he used the Hebrew term “mamlachtiyut,” a concept of putting the national interest first, coined by Israel’s founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion.Netanyahu loyalists saw the attack as an inside job. Some Likud politicians said that Mr. Rivlin “is no longer one of us,” and others suggested abolishing the presidency.Days later, at a swearing-in ceremony for the new president of the Supreme Court at Mr. Rivlin’s official residence, Mr. Netanyahu was philosophical. Citing Montesquieu and Kant, he said, “In all democracies there is a perpetual and often stormy argument about demarcating the boundaries between the branches of government. That isn’t a blow to democracy; that is the essence of democracy. It always exists.”In a conciliatory tone, Mr. Netanyahu emphasized the importance of a strong and independent Supreme Court. Quoting Cicero’s description of the Jews of Rome 2,000 years ago as a “litigious people,” he added, “Nothing has changed. We argue, argue and argue again.” The point, he said, was to create an “effective” and “dignified” dialogue based on mutual respect.Mr. Netanyahu, who has been elected four times, leads what many describe as the most nationalist and illiberal government in Israel’s history.Debbie Gild-Hayo, a lawyer who tracks legislation for the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, a human rights group, said anti-democratic legislation has snowballed in recent years.“The democratic space is shrinking,” she said.The government is dominated by right-wing and religious parties, while the opposition is divided and weak. That made Mr. Rivlin’s voice all the more significant.“The left wing is attacking Netanyahu all day long but has no influence,” said Avi Shilon, an Israeli historian who teaches at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and N.Y.U. Tel Aviv. “You need somebody from the right wing, from the roots of Revisionism.”Daniel Gordis, an author and senior vice president of Jerusalem’s Shalem College for the liberal arts, says he views much of what is happening in Israel “in the shadow of the Trump administration.” With all the differences in personality, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump have resorted to similar tactics, such as decrying the mainstream news media as purveyors of “fake news.”Mr. Rivlin probably felt he had an obligation to speak up, Mr. Gordis said, because Israel was “inching ominously toward a watershed moment.” But unlike the United States, he added, “Israel is a 70-year-old democracy, not 250 years old.”', "JERUSALEM – President Donald Trump's expected recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital is a move that could have deep repercussions across the region.Wednesday's expected recognition will be welcomed by U.S. ally Israel and it will be popular with pro-Israel evangelical Christian voters who make up a key part of Trump's base.But it could also trigger violence in the region, derail a developing U.S. Mideast peace plan before it even gets off the ground and infuriate key allies in the Arab world and the West.Israel claims all of the city as its capital, while the Palestinians claim the city's eastern sector, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of a future independent state. The international community overwhelmingly says Jerusalem's final status should be resolved through negotiations.", 'Saudi Arabia Orders Its Citizens Out of Lebanon, Raising Fears of War - The New York Times', 'WASHINGTON – The Trump administration put the Palestinians on notice Friday that it will shutter their office in Washington unless they’ve entered serious peace talks with Israel, U.S. officials said, potentially giving President Donald Trump more leverage as he seeks an elusive Mideast peace deal.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has determined that the Palestinians ran afoul of an obscure provision in a U.S. law that says the Palestine Liberation Organization’s mission must close if the Palestinians try to get the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israelis for crimes against Palestinians. A State Department official said that in September, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas crossed that line by calling on the ICC to investigate and prosecute Israelis.But the law leaves the president a way out, so Tillerson’s declaration doesn’t necessarily mean the office will close.Trump now has 90 days to consider whether the Palestinians are in “direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel.” If Trump determines they are, the Palestinians can keep the office. The official said it was unclear whether the U.S. might close the office before the 90-day period expires, but said the mission remains open at least for now.Even if the office closes, the U.S. said it wasn’t cutting off relations with the Palestinians and was still focused on “a comprehensive peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.” The State Department official said in an email that “this measure should in no way be seen as a signal that the U.S. is backing off those efforts.” The official wasn’t authorized to be identified by name and requested anonymity.The PLO office and the Israeli Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Although the Israelis and Palestinians are not engaged in active, direct negotiations, Trump’s administration has been working all year to broker a peace deal that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Led by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior aide, White House officials have been preparing a peace proposal they intend to put forward at an unspecified time.The Palestinians, though publicly supportive of the U.S. effort, have been skeptical because Trump’s close ties to Israel suggest whatever deal he proposes might be unfavorable to them. The threat of losing their office in the U.S. capital could become another pressure point as the Trump administration seeks to persuade the Palestinians to come to the table.The Palestine Liberation Organization is the group that formally represents all Palestinians. Although the U.S. does not recognize Palestinian statehood, the PLO maintains a “general delegation” office in Washington that facilitates Palestinian officials’ interactions with the U.S. government.The United States allowed the PLO to open a mission in Washington in 1994, a move that required then-President Bill Clinton to waive a law that said the Palestinians couldn’t have an office. In 2011, under the Obama administration, the United States started letting the Palestinians fly their flag over the office, an upgrade to the status of their mission that the Palestinians hailed as historic.Israel opposes any Palestinian membership in United Nations-related organizations until a peace deal has been reached.The Trump administration has not revealed any details about its effort to bring about a peace deal that would ostensibly grant the Palestinians an independent state in exchange for an end to its conflict with the Israelis. But Kushner and other top Trump aides have been shuttling to the region to meet with Palestinians, Israelis and officials from neighboring Arab nations as it prepares to put forward a peace plan.The requirement that the PLO office be closed if the Palestinians back an International Criminal Court move came in a little-noticed provision in U.S. law that says the United States can’t allow the Palestinians to have a Washington office if they try to “influence a determination by the ICC to initiate a judicially authorized investigation, or to actively support such an investigation, that subjects Israeli nationals to an investigation for alleged crimes against Palestinians.”Abbas, the Palestinian leader, said in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in September that the Palestinians had “called on the International Criminal Court to open an investigation and to prosecute Israeli officials for their involvement in settlement activities and aggressions against our people.”The U.S. law says that if the government determines the Palestinians have breached that requirement, it triggers a 90-day review period in which the president must decide whether to let the office stay open anyway. The president is allowed to waive the requirement only if he certifies to Congress “that the Palestinians have entered into direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel.”The provision doesn’t explicitly define what would constitute direct or meaningful negotiations.', 'Fake news is a problem, but fake history is worse. And fake history has a lot to do with the troubles in the Middle East and the controversy surrounding Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.President Trump announced Wednesday that the United States is formally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and will therefore move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.We were invited to participate in a conference call on this important decision hosted by White House Deputy Director and Special Assistant to the President Jennifer Korn on Wednesday afternoon. Ambassador David Satterfield, who is principal deputy assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, discussed the implications of this decision and replied to a number of questions.The controversy is stark. Not surprisingly CNN has posted columns promising that the president’s decision will cause “upheaval” and “dangerous reverberations.” The New York Times says Trump’s announcement “has drawn a storm of criticism from Arab and European leaders.”And, predictably, various Palestinian groups, such as Hamas, are calling for protests and “three days of rage.”Even Palestinian Christians burned pictures of President Trump in Bethlehem over implications from his announcement on Jerusalem.President Trump has commented that his decision is“recognition of reality.” Well, of course it is. And it is recognition of history too.The background briefing we were sent prior to the White House conference call makes it clear that the president and his team understand the importance of history – not the bogus narrative many on the left embrace.We all know how the president feels about “fake news.” As it turns out, he doesn’t like “fake history” either. Peace in the Middle East will never happen if we keep lying about history.Three important points – truthful history – need to be made.First, the rejection of the Jewish State of Israel and the opposition to Israel’s claim of Jerusalem as the nation’s capital are based on fake history.Key Islamic leaders have rewritten history, denying the historical existence of Israel. This is absurd. Finding peace in the Middle East is not helped refusing to tell the truth about the past.The most egregious fake history revolves around the claim that there never was an ancient kingdom of Israel and that the Jewish people never had a temple in Jerusalem.No trained historian and certainly no competent archaeologist agrees with such nonsense. Of course ancient Israel existed – and existed in the very place where modern Israel exists today.But many Muslims and Muslim leaders simply refuse to accept the facts of history. Responsible world leaders need to call them out. We cannot talk peace if we keep lying about history.Ron Dermer, Israel’s ambassador to the United States, recently spoke at the dedication service for the Museum of the Bible in Washington. We listened as he said the values of the Bible “gave us the strength to turn tragedy into triumph, restore our sovereignty and rebuild Jerusalem, the original DC – David’s Capital.”Second, President Trump is on the right side of history.By recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, President Trump is affirming the Jewish people’s history. He is also correcting a long-standing historical problem and a grievous injustice.The president is doing nothing radical. His support for Israel is in step with the West’s support for the creation of the independent State of Israel in the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust.Third, not recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital sets a dangerous precedent.Refusing to do this, because of fear of what Muslim nations and Islamic terrorists might do, rewards terrorism. And it tacitly gives credence to false narratives and false maps of the world, on which “Israel” does not appear.Denying Israel’s ancient history makes it easier for the anti-Semites and haters of Israel to oppose modern Israel’s claim to the land, including its historic capital city Jerusalem.Many Jews and Christians offer theological arguments, citing biblical promises and prophecies about Israel being the home of the Jews. All of that is interesting, to be sure.But the point that non-religious people should understand is that the Jewish people’s claim to the land that Israel now occupies is a historic claim based on facts – not simply a matter of faith.The Jewish people have in fact lived in their land of Israel for more than 3.000 years and took possession of the city of Jerusalem itself almost exactly 3,000 years ago. They have lived there continuously, even though they have not always ruled over their own land.Therefore, Israel’s legitimate claims to the land and to the city of Jerusalem itself should be accepted – regardless of your religious beliefs, or even if you have no belief whatsoever in any religion.That, of course does not mean the Palestinians have no rights. They do. But no peace plan will succeed if and until Israel’s right to exist and its right to claim Jerusalem as its capital are universally acknowledged.President Trump has taken the right step. People who know the real history – not a fake history – should support his decision.Jeremiah J.

If they are not held accountable, they become further emboldened. And for the victims, it is a little closure and justice.”Ultimately, the powerhouse lawyer digs deep to find as many legal loopholes as possible.Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, an Israeli lawyer, has successfully sued scores of terrorist groups and state sponsors of terror.             “We try to focus on entities and individuals and rogue regimes that provide it material support and resources. Even then it is very hard to nail down. ISIS moves funds through Islamic ‘Halawa’ money transfers. These are informal networks of money changers who will move sums internationally between branches in neighborhoods of Islamic countries, for a small percentage,” Darshan-Leitner explained. “This dark banking system, which is not plugged into the official international banking system can move funds around virtually undetected. It is a relentless struggle, but we are confident that if we continue to pursue groups like ISIS we can learn a lot about their finances and partners.”While going precisely after ISIS is a near-impossible feat given the covert nature of its operatives in Iraq, Syria and scattered through western countries, Leitner instead goes after the individuals and businesses who —directly or indirectly —fund them from banks to oil exporters to charities and most recently, social media conglomerates.As such, the firm’s focus has been to go after those individuals and businesses located in Western states that “aid and abet” the black-clad jihadist army in violation of international antiterrorism laws, which includes social media platforms.“YouTube provides ISIS with the ability to post its videos and disseminate its messages, and Twitter provides the terror group services,” Darshan-Leitner contended. “Western law enforcement agencies have already determined that several of the deadly ISIS attacks in Europe were perpetuated by terrorists who organized via their social media accounts. Where would ISIS be today if they weren’t able to post beheading videos and recruitment propaganda? How would teens know how to contact them or travel to Syria to join them?”Darshan-Leitner has to-date filed suits against Facebook, Google —the owner of YouTube —and Twitter on behalf of ISIS and Hamas victims. The cases, initially filed in New York courts, largely have been moved to California at the request of the mostly Palo Alto-based enterprises.“The social media companies are liable as they violated U.S. law in providing material support and resources,” she said. “Clearly, these companies with their sophisticated technology and logarithms which allow them to know everything about their users’ likes and dislikes, have the capabilities to identify and block the terror groups and block the calls to violence.”AS NORTH KOREA THREATENS ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE ATTACK, QUESTIONS OVER LAPSES IN U.S. GRID SECURITY RISEAnd when it comes to suing governments, Darshan-Leitner has had scores of judgments against the regimes of Iran and Syria for “their involvement in international terrorism and support of groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas” in legal standing of Americans killed or wounded in the Middle East.“Iran and Syria continue to be the largest state sponsors of international terrorism. They provide the finances, training, weapons, safe houses and ideology,” she claimed. “We are very persistent in continuing to file suits against them and we try to locate Iranian and Syrian assets that we can try to seize to enforce our judgments. It is a war of attrition, and we will continue to pursue these outlaw regimes on behalf of the terror victims and their families.”On that note, Darshan-Leitner is now deep in a $67 million judgment against U.S.-based Boeing, representing the American Leibovitch family —who lost their seven-year-old child to a 2003 Iran-connected terror attack —over the flight giant’s contentious deal with Tehran. Following the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action —commonly called the “Iran Deal” —the previously pariah nation entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase some $20 billion in aircraft.IRANIAN EX-PATS RALLY WHILE ROUHANI RAILSDarshan-Leitner wants all the information on how and where the money is going to be exposed, but Boeing has asserted that disclosing the details of the transaction would be an obstruction of a U.S. foreign policy and has fought resolutely to keep the details secret.Darshan-Leitner is pushing for the Trump administration to agree that Boeing should disclose details regarding its multi-billion dollar deal selling aircraft to the Iranian regime.(REUTERS/Matt Mills)Earlier this month, a Chicago federal court ordered the Trump administration to file a statement by October 12 notifying the court if the government concurs that unveiling the details of the Boeing deal will interfere with Iranian-U.S. foreign policy. Boeing declined to comment further on the matter.Given that Iran and Syria are the only official state sponsors of terror listed in the United States, along with Sudan, suits against them can be filed in American courts. But with other regimes such as North Korea, the process is more complicated and must be filed outside the U.S given that the hermit country was quietly removed from the list in 2008, granting them sovereign immunity and thus they cannot be sued by U.S citizens.ISIS STILL STEALING, SPILLING AND SMUGGLING OIL THROUGHOUT IRAQPrior to that, Darshan-Leitner successfully represented American citizens in three historic multimillion dollar verdicts against the regime in Pyongyang. She won a monumental $30 million judgment on behalf of the family of Kim Dong-shik, a U.S. resident and Christian missionary kidnapped in 2000 and murdered in North Korea by the regime. In 2006, she won a case for Hezbollah rocket attack victims after a U.S. federal court determined that North Korea was liable for providing support to Hezbollah, along with a case in a San Juan Puerto Rico court involving the 1972 Lod Airport attack in which a court ruled North Korea trained and funded terrorists.“We continue to look for elusive North Korean assets. They conduct little trade and commerce and so going after their assets in order to enforce our judgments is difficult, so we are trying to be very diligent in our efforts to locate those who are illegally trading with North Korea or providing it an type of services or goods that can be seized,” the attorney continued, adding that North Korea ought to be placed once again as a state sponsor of terror so that other victims’ families, such as Otto Warmbier’s parents, can target them directly.Darshan-Leitner, who was born and raised in Israel in a time when one could not even “walk the streets” for fear of an attack, said that she could not “sit idly” and sees it as her lifelong mission to bring terrorists and their backers to justice.“We see our efforts, utilizing lawsuits and court systems to counter the terrorists as an important part of the effort to obstruct. Western governments are shackled by treaties, domestic restraints and political correctness and have trouble doing what needs to be done to target and destroy terror groups,” she added. “We are private attorneys representing private terror victims. Once a group like ISIS crosses the line of all civilized behavior, they have to be battled until they are destroyed. Or they will return and come back at us.”Hollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

There, guided by English-speaking teachers and surrounded by toddlers babbling in loose English, I adopted the new language quickly.Young bats may not be so different.Wild fruit bats, living in crowded roosts, are exposed to calls from hundreds of fellow bats from birth. Most often these calls are made in response to unsolicited physical contact, and essentially amount to a crabby “move out of my way.” In a study published Wednesday in PLOS Biology, a team of Israeli researchers found that bat pups match their vocalizations to the group sounds they are immersed in, even if this “dialect” differs from that of their mothers.Human babies and toddlers pick up the utterances around them effortlessly. The ability, called vocal learning, is considered critical for our spoken language.But vocal learning has rarely been proven to exist in animals other than humans or songbirds, said Yossi Yovel, a neuroecologist at Tel Aviv University who led the study with graduate students Yosef Prat and Lindsay Azoulay.In nonhuman mammals, much of the evidence for vocal learning “comes from animals that imitate human speech or other artificial sounds,” such as a zoo elephant emulating the Korean spoken by his keepers, Mr. Prat said. What he and his colleagues wanted to know was how an animal learns the sounds of its own species.To start, the scientists captured 14 wild pregnant Egyptian fruit bats, a highly social and vocal species commonly found in the Middle East. Each mother gave birth in one of three chambers.In these chambers, the researchers played different soundtracks to the pups continuously, starting from birth. The tracks sampled calls from actual bats, each mimicking a cave or tree roost with 300 bats in it, but featured different ranges of pitch.For a few months, the bat mothers were also kept in the chambers and would regularly communicate with their offspring. But at 14 weeks, when a pup would normally become independent in the wild, the mothers were set free. At this point, the researchers started recording the pups’ vocalizations every few months until the bats reached adulthood.Over time, the scientists found, the three pup groups took on distinct dialects. “When we examined the dialects more carefully, we found that they were similar to what the bats were hearing — the high-pitched group shifted toward higher-pitched calls and the low-pitched group shifted toward lower-pitched calls,” Dr. Yovel said.He added that the difference between the calls the bats learned from their mothers and the ones they adopted from the soundtracks could be considered similar to the difference between New England and Texan accents. And while it’s not known whether bat colonies in different locations naturally communicate with varying frequencies, Dr. Yovel said, “our findings suggest they do.”Next, his team wants to see how dialects affect the bats’ social behaviors. “If I teach a few bats a new dialect and then send them into a new colony, how will they be treated?” he said.The research also touches on broader evolutionary questions, like whether human vocal learning emerged independently, or whether it’s a more primitive behavior, spread across the mammalian kingdom, Dr. Yovel said. So far, aside from bats, vocal learning has anecdotally been reported in just a few other nonhuman mammals, including whales, seals and other primates.Mirjam Knörnschild, a bat expert at the Free University of Berlin who was not involved in the study, suspects vocal learning takes place in far more species.“The departure from the classical songbird model intrigued me most about this paper,” she said. “I think vocal plasticity, or vocal learning, is something not rare, but prominent, in the lives of many animals.”', '                                    Jar with remains of the toads.

They were surprised by what they found inside: numerous vessels containing date palms and myrtle bushes, neither of which were native to the area, and — strangest of all — the decapitated bodies of at least nine toads.The tomb was uncovered prior to the expansion of a neighborhood in the Hahal Repha’im basin, which was fertile ground for settlement during the Canaanite period four millennia ago. Excavators uncovered two settlements, two temples and several cemeteries in the area that “provide new insight into the life of the local population at that time,” according to excavation directors Shua Kisilevitz and Zohar Turgeman-Yaffe.SPY SATELLITES, DRONES, HELP EXPERTS DISCOVER LOST CITY IN IRAQ FOUNDED AFTER ALEXANDER THE GREAT“For an archaeologist, finding tombs that were intentionally sealed in antiquity is a priceless treasure, because they are a time capsule that allows us to encounter objects almost just as they were originally left,” they said on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority.“At that time, it was customary to bury the dead with offerings that constituted a kind of ‘burial kit,’ which, it was believed, would serve the deceased in the afterworld. When we removed the stone that blocked the tomb opening, we were excited to discover intact bowls and jars.SPHINX, BABOON AND CAT STATUES STATUES FOUND IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN BURIAL“In one of the jars, to our surprise, we found a heap of small bones. The study of the bones … revealed at least nine toads. Interestingly, they had been decapitated.”Israeli scholars believe the date palms and myrtle bushes were planted at the site intentionally, because they were not in their natural habitat, and that they may have come from a nearby orchard that was planted for the purpose of funerary offerings. Experts think that the jar with the headless toads was also among the offerings.ARCHAEOLOGISTS IN NORWAY MAY HAVE UNEARTHED A VIKING BOAT GRAVEThe date palm symbolized fertility and rejuvenation during the period, said Dr. Dafna Langgut of Tel Aviv University.', 'Jewish Center Faces Backlash After Canceling Play Criticized as Anti-Israel - The New York TimesThe American Jewish Historical Society is facing a backlash over its decision to cancel two events, after a campaign by right-wing activists who had criticized them as anti-Israel.The society, which is based at the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan, announced on Tuesday that it was canceling a reading of “Rubble Rubble,” a play by Dan Fishback, and a panel about the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which was co-sponsored by the group Jewish Voice for Peace. Mr. Fishback is also a member of the group, which is part of the broader movement calling for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel, known as BDS.The two events, planned months ago, came under criticism from right-wing activists in recent days, as the latest salvo in a wider campaign against the new executive director of the Center for Jewish History, David Myers, over his involvement in groups like New Israel Fund, which promotes human rights and social justice.And on Monday night, the board of the historical society voted to cancel them.“While the programs themselves may have merit, they do not align with the mission of the A.J.H.S.,” the board said in a statement posted online.The decision drew strong criticism from some in the arts, including the theater director Rachel Chavkin, who described it on Twitter as “right-wing censorship.” And on Wednesday morning, Ofri Cnaani, an Israeli-American artist, removed an installation exploring the life of Emma Goldman that she had created in the lobby of the group’s building.Ms. Cnaani, in a telephone interview, said while she was not a supporter of BDS, the cancellation of the events demanded a response, especially given that her installation, “For Her Own Good,” explores Goldman’s defense of freedom of speech.“When I heard about it, I was shocked,” Ms. Cnaani said. “I immediately thought that to not do anything would amount to supporting this decision.”Mr. Fishback’s play, which was to get its first full public reading at the historical society on Dec. 14, tells the dual stories of a modern-day settler family in the West Bank and a Jewish family caught up in revolutionary politics in early-20th-century Russia. While it explores “how Jewish families are broken over the politics of Israel-Palestine,” he said in an interview, the cancellation was not about the play’s substance.“The people who made this decision had no access to my script,” he said. “This was about my beliefs.”The American Jewish Historical Society, which holds about 40 million archival items, including the original manuscript of Emma Lazarus’s poem “The New Colossus,” is one of five scholarly organizations housed at the Center for Jewish History. While they share a space, each operates with significant autonomy.While the center has strongly supported Mr. Myers, who is also a professor of Jewish history at the University of California, Los Angeles, against his critics, the cancellation suggests disagreement over how to respond to those who have campaigned against him.Rachel Lithgow, the historical society’s executive director, who programmed the two events, emphasized that the cancellation was the board’s decision, which she disagreed with but accepted.“I don’t like this decision, nor have I liked other decisions that have been made,” she said in an interview. But, she added, “I answer to a board I respect.”Asked about the board’s description of the events as out of step with the society’s mission, Ms. Lithgow, who said she had received numerous threatening emails in recent days, said simply, “Our mission hasn’t changed.” (Bernard J. Michael, the board’s president, declined to elaborate on the statement or otherwise comment.)Mr. Fishback, the playwright, said he hoped to stage the reading elsewhere, and by Wednesday evening had already raised nearly $5,000 in an online appeal to finance it.“I want to use this as an opportunity to shed light on negative effects of silencing in the Jewish community,” he said. “This play will see the light of day one way or another.”', "Conor Powell reporter from IsraelJERUSALEM – Palestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II.

A Defiant Protest. - The New York TimesBy the time you’re 33 and you’ve flown solo at more weddings than you can count, the idea of spending a Sunday morning attending three of them is about as appealing as a nude December dip in the Gowanus Canal.Yet that’s exactly what I did last weekend, along with some 1,300 other New Yorkers.None of us knew a single bride or groom. No one brought a gift. Yet there we were, packed into the pews of an Upper East Side synagogue, crying as the newlyweds exchanged vows and smashed glasses under the huppah.Our tears were not just for the couples’ obvious love for each other, as palpable as it was, or because the brides looked stunning in gowns given to them by Kleinfeld Bridal, though they did.Those tears were also because the ritual was more than a wedding: It was a moment of proud political defiance for three couples who can’t or won’t marry in the state they call home. It just so happens that the state is the world’s only Jewish one.In Israel, there is no civil marriage. All elements of religious life — from the kosher certification of food to conversion to circumcisions, marriages and burials — are controlled by the rabbinate. In Israel, then, the official religion is not just Judaism. It’s Orthodoxy.Thus Israel’s religious monopoly presents an immovable obstacle for people like Ori Berwald Shaer and Alona Livneh, L.G.B.T. activists who exchanged vows on Sunday. The couple couldn’t do so in Israel because the rabbinate doesn’t recognize same-sex marriage.The power of the rabbinate is an equally major stumbling block for converts like Elizabetha Komkov, who promised to spend the rest of her days with Valentine Boldovskiy, a man she met at Hebrew school in St. Petersburg. Both immigrated to Israel from their native Russia, where they reunited five years ago.But like so many immigrants from the former Soviet Union, under Jewish religious law (Halakha), Ms. Komkov was not considered technically Jewish. Stalin ripped away her Jewish roots when her great-grandmother, born a Jew, was given away to a Christian family to save her life. Her name was changed, and there was no documentation for her great-granddaughter to later prove her Jewishness.After Ms. Komkov’s 2004 immigration to Israel with her parents, she converted — but within the Reform movement, which is not recognized by the rabbinate. So it was impossible for her to marry in the Jewish state.The rabbinate’s power is also unacceptable to Israelis like Gali Geberovich and Alon Sela, whose love story is like something out of a Leon Uris novel. The pair met on a kibbutz in 2010, after their mandatory army service. He milked cows. She grew scallions. This couple would face no technical problem marrying in Israel, but Ms. Geberovich and Mr. Sela insist that their feminist values make such a choice a nonstarter. They note, for example, that the Orthodox Jewish marriage contract, the ketubah, is a one-way agreement in which the groom acquires the bride.And so these six Israelis left the Jewish state and flew across the world to marry in a Jewish community that would recognize their unions as kosher.Temple Emanu-El, a Reform congregation on the Upper East Side, hosted the affair, in which some 40 Conservative and Reform rabbis participated. No detail was too small for Gady Levy, the executive director of the synagogue’s Streicker Center: The ceremony opened with a dramatic procession of violinists playing “Sunrise, Sunset”; it ended with white cupcakes for all of the guests.In the lobby, everyone was invited to sign a giant card addressed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel: “The current system,” it read, “does not fit with Israel’s democratic values or nature. This is another way that the Israeli government denies freedom of religion, destroys pluralism and keeps many Jews from feeling part of the Jewish state.”Standing before us, beaming through their tears, were six casualties of the current system. All three couples expressed their love for Israel during the ceremony and their commitment to building families there. And yet they also expressed anger and sorrow over the fact that the state to which they are so passionately dedicated shuns their relationships.Ms. Berwald Shaer summed up the collective sentiment when she said to her wife during her vows: “I love you. And I love tradition. And I refuse to choose between the two.”Yet that choice is exactly the one being forced on Israeli couples who are denied the right or refuse to be married under Orthodox auspices. “I do Reform Jewish weddings for couples in Israel, but they aren’t recognized by the state, so these couples have to go abroad to get civil marriages in order to get the benefits of married couples in Israel,” Noa Sattath, a Reform rabbi in Israel who was an officiant on Sunday, explained to me. “Most of them go to Cyprus, which has a booming industry for Israeli marriages. There, they get married by an archbishop under a giant cross. And that wedding, ironically, is the one recognized by the state.” In the case of the three couples married on Sunday, it will be their civil marriages — they went to City Hall — that will be recognized by Israel.Since the founding of Israel in 1948, the Jews of the diaspora have regarded it as the fulfillment of a 2,000-year-old dream. To our grandparents’ and our parents’ generations, Israel was the improbable David, facing dangers entirely foreign to American Jews. Understandably, diaspora Jews, especially those Americans lucky to live in the wealthiest and most powerful Jewish community in history, felt their obligation was to support this pioneering enterprise in any way they could — spiritually, politically and financially.But increasingly, liberal Jews, especially younger ones, feel they are being asked to choose between their commitment to progressive values and their commitment to Israel. Largely that’s because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the occupation. But Israel’s disregard for the religious liberty of Jews doesn’t ease the tension.As Joshua Davidson, the senior rabbi of Temple Emanu-El, put it to me: “The establishment of Israel is the greatest project of justice for a persecuted people that the world has ever known. But when liberal Jews are asked to check their liberal values at the door, it makes it harder for them to support the Jewish state.”The Israeli government’s decision this summer, for example, to renege on its promise to create a new egalitarian area at the Western Wall in Jerusalem — a religious site that the rabbinate controls and where there are separate areas for men and women — felt, in the words of Salai Meridor, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, like “a slap in the face to world Jewry.” Jewish leaders across America echoed that sense of betrayal.More than 70 years since its founding, Israel can no longer expect the unconditional support of diaspora Jews if the love remains unrequited. Israel’s highest aspiration may be to be a light among the nations, but it is also a normal nation, where regular people want to go about their business without a religious authority having a say.The Jewish state has so much to teach diaspora Jews about resilience, innovation, energy and optimism. One area where American Jews have something to teach Israel is religious pluralism, something that living in a democracy with a separation between church and state has helped us fine-tune.In a speech before the wedding began, Anat Hoffman, a feminist activist and the executive director of the Israel Religious Action Center, quoted “Hatikvah,” Israel’s national anthem, which expresses the Jewish hope “to be a free people in our land.” But another line came to me as I walked home from the East Side to the West: “Od lo avdah tikvateinu” — “Our hope is not yet lost.”', '                                    Activist Linda Sarsour prepares for the beginning of a demonstration outside of Trump Tower.

Palestinian officials also called for mass protests in the event of the recognition.The Organization for Islamic Cooperation, an umbrella organization of Muslim countries, said Monday that the move would constitute “naked aggression” against the Arab and Muslim world.In Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron told Trump during a telephone call on Monday that he was “concerned” about the plan and asked to reconsider the move, the Jerusalem Post reported.“Mr. Macron reaffirmed that the status of Jerusalem must be resolved through peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, particularly those relating to the establishment of two states,” Macron’s office said.The opposition surrounds East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967 after Arab nations launched an all-out attack against the state, the home of a large Muslim population.

Over Jerusalem Decree - The New York TimesUNITED NATIONS — The United States faced blunt and sometimes withering criticism from friends and adversaries alike at the United Nations on Friday over President Trump’s declaration that Jerusalem is Israel’s capital and his plans to move the American Embassy to the highly contested holy city.The rebukes, made at an emergency Security Council meeting called over Mr. Trump’s announcement, constituted an extraordinarily public denunciation of American policy on the world’s most prominent diplomatic stage, leaving the United States alone on the issue among the council’s 15 members.One by one, the ambassadors of Sweden, Egypt, Britain, France and Bolivia, among others, reiterated their view that President Trump’s announcement had subverted the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a longtime bedrock of the United Nations position on resolving it. Some, like Bolivia’s ambassador, Sacha Sergio Llorenty Solíz, demanded that the body take action, “otherwise the Security Council will become an occupied territory,” he said.It is unclear what the council members could do, however, except to voice their anger and frustration. The United States is one of the five permanent members and could veto any resolution seeking to condemn President Trump’s decision.After the meeting adjourned, however, the ambassadors of Britain, France, Sweden, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement outside the council’s chambers condemning their American ally’s change of position, saying it was “not in line with Security Council resolutions and was unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region.”Ambassador Olof Skoog of Sweden said during the meeting that “the statement by the United States president goes against the plea of many friends of the United States and Israel.”Amr Abdellatif Aboulatta, the ambassador from Egypt — one of the few Muslim-majority nations to have recognized Israel — recited a litany of Security Council resolutions aimed in part at preventing Israel from declaring sovereignty over all of Jerusalem.The Security Council considers East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 war, as occupied territory, and that its status should be resolved in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state.“This is a dangerous precedent,” the Egyptian ambassador said. “These are the resolutions of the Security Council.” He said the resolutions constitute “the law that governs the status of Jerusalem. All countries have pledged, according the U.N. charter, to implement and abide by it.”Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador, defended President Trump’s decision, asserting that Jerusalem has been the capital of Israel since its founding in 1948, “despite many attempts by others to deny that reality.”Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador, who, along with the Palestinian ambassador, had been invited to address the council, was Ms. Haley’s only supporter during the meeting. He called Mr. Trump’s announcement “a courageous decision.”The Palestinian ambassador, Riyad H. Mansour, urged the Security Council to reaffirm its position on Jerusalem in a new resolution and said that the United States decision “disqualifies its role as a just broker for peace.”Mr. Trump said in his announcement on Wednesday that the decision was “nothing more or less than a recognition of reality,” and was not intended to pre-empt a negotiated solution to the conflict or to take a position on the city’s boundaries.Critics have said that recognizing Israel’s claim to Jerusalem without acknowledging a Palestinian claim broke with international consensus and prejudged the outcome of any negotiations.', 'Palestinian Factions, Fatah and Hamas, Move Toward Reconciliation in Gaza - The New York TimesGAZA CITY — Beleaguered Gazans exulted at seeing the two main Palestinian factions take an important step toward reconciliation on Monday, as the Palestinian Authority’s prime minister arrived to take the reins of their impoverished territory’s government.If the effort succeeds, the Palestinians could have a unified leadership for the first time in a decade, potentially giving them more leverage in their push for an independent state.Thousands lined the streets and cheered as a motorcade carrying the prime minister, Rami Hamdallah of the Fatah faction, crossed into Gaza at an Israeli checkpoint, leading a delegation from the Palestinian Authority based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.The delegation will hold talks on taking charge of Gaza’s government from Hamas, the militant Islamic faction that evicted Fatah in 2007 and has run it ever since.While major decisions on how that transfer might unfold have yet to be made, Mr. Hamdallah’s trip punctuated the most ambitious effort yet to reconcile the animosity between the Fatah and Hamas factions after repeated failures in recent years.Mr. Hamdallah promised that his first priority was easing Gazans’ suffering, which has deepened because of repeated wars with Israel since the Hamas takeover and under a dual Israeli-Egyptian blockade.“I realize that the situation in Gaza has become unbearable because of wars and division,” Mr. Hamdallah said.He also said reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas was necessary if the Palestinians were to confront Israel effectively.“The world will not pay attention to a torn people,” he said. “The main winner of a continued split is the occupation.”The deprivations in Gaza have grown only more acute since Mr. Hamdallah’s boss, President Mahmoud Abbas, imposed harsh restrictions on Hamas over the summer. Mr. Abbas stopped paying for Gaza’s electricity and reduced the salaries of thousands of bureaucrats, teachers and police officers, who have been on the payroll for years though Mr. Abbas ordered them not to work for Hamas.Water quality has become dangerously poor, the air reeks of raw sewage, and the unemployment rate is approaching 50 percent, worse among the young.Fatah and Hamas have made many attempts at reconciliation, and even formed a government together in 2014, but within weeks that agreement fell apart and a new war between Hamas and Israel intervened.This time, however, Hamas has responded to Mr. Abbas’s pressure by effectively daring him to step up and take responsibility for Gaza. And the new Hamas leaders — who attended a lunch on Monday with Mr. Hamdallah at the home of Ahmed Hiles, the leader of a Fatah-aligned clan that has clashed violently with Hamas — insist they are serious about making concessions in the name of unity.“I will break the neck of anyone who doesn’t want the reconciliation, whoever he is, from Hamas or any other faction,” Yehya Sinwar, the prime minister of Gaza, told a group of Gazan youths in a speech late last week.Mr. Hamdallah is to lead a cabinet meeting in Gaza City on Tuesday, but the real work of resolving how Gaza will be run, and when Mr. Abbas’s restrictions may be lifted, is to wait until next week, when both sides are to begin talks in earnest in Cairo.A key issue is whether Hamas or the Palestinian Authority will truly control the border crossings with Israel and Egypt, particularly the Rafah crossing with Egypt, Gaza’s main gateway to the world. The Gaza-Egypt border has been mostly closed since President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt took power in 2013.Other serious obstacles threaten any agreement, notably what will become of the Qassam Brigades, the armed faction of Hamas, which has as many as 20,000 fighters. Hamas leaders have said disarming those fighters is not up for discussion.Israel, which considers Hamas a terrorist organization, also presents a major challenge to any Fatah-Hamas reconciliation. How the Israelis might respond is not yet clear.In one sign of possible movement on the division of responsibilities in Gaza, Salah Al Bardawil, a senior Hamas leader, said shortly before Mr. Hamdallah’s arrival on Monday that 3,000 Palestinian Authority security officers would be added to the Gaza police force over the next year.Analysts say that leaving the Hamas military intact while the Palestinian Authority provides police and other government services in Gaza would threaten to replicate the situation in Lebanon, where Hezbollah holds far greater power than the Lebanese government — a situation that Mr. Abbas is likely to find unacceptable.But Egypt, through its General Intelligence Service, which has been brokering the reconciliation talks, has been pressing both sides to take the first steps and then to see what unfolds.Eran Lerman, a former deputy director of Israel’s National Security Council, said that while a Hezbollah-like arrangement in Gaza would be no improvement in Israel’s eyes, there were good reasons Israel had not yet responded negatively to the Palestinian reconciliation efforts.“One is that the Egyptian role is overt, aggressive, and we basically have the same instincts as the Egyptians do when it comes to Hamas, but of course they have ways of influencing what is happening in Gaza that Israel no longer has,” he said. “The consequence is that we basically trust them to take steps that restrain Hamas and undermine their legitimacy in the long run.”Another reason for Israel’s forbearance, Mr. Lerman said, was that Hamas had grasped “that the people of Gaza are sick and tired of the deprivation that is caused by aspects of Hamas rule,” whether in prioritizing military over civilian spending or in provoking Mr. Abbas to impose sanctions.“If there is an underlying theme here,” Mr. Lerman said, “it is that Hamas as a government has come to terms with things that Hamas as a terror organization had refused to come to terms with, and that’s a positive.”No less problematic than what becomes of the Hamas fighters, who are the heart of the organization, is the question of which workers will be employed by an overhauled Gaza government: the 40,000 Hamas loyalists who have been holding those jobs for the past 10 years, or the thousands more Fatah workers who performed those functions until the Hamas takeover.Standing outside the Hamas-run checkpoint at the Erez crossing, where police officers beat some onlookers with clubs to clear a path for the Palestinian Authority’s motorcade, Ashraf al-Kfarna, 30, said he had once worked inside Gaza when it was run by Fatah, and now hoped to get his old job back or work for the police.He said his brother had been killed during the fighting between Hamas and Fatah that led to Fatah’s ouster from Gaza.Beyond his own situation, Mr. Kfrana said he hoped Mr. Hamdallah would “create job opportunities for young men like me,” and pointed to two friends at the front of a crush of Gazans, young and old. “These guys don’t work — they have no pennies in their pockets.”The issues dividing Hamas and Fatah also include Muhammad Dahlan, a former Fatah security chief in Gaza, who has been in exile in the United Arab Emirates since a 2011 break with Mr. Abbas. Mr. Dahlan has forged close ties with Hamas and promoted improved relations between Hamas and Egypt.On Sunday, when Hamas released five Fatah prisoners, one of them publicly thanked Mr. Dahlan.But Mr. Abbas rejects any role for Mr. Dahlan in a reconciled Palestinian government.If reconciliation faces so many hurdles as to seem a still-remote possibility, it appeared meaningfully closer on Monday, judging by the reception the Palestinian Authority delegation received.Young boys danced, women ululated, teenagers climbed trees, cars and rooftops, and chanting crowds waved yellow Fatah flags and the red, white and black flag of Egypt.Seated in the shadow of a vendor’s cart, Naama Tluli, 72, said she was overjoyed. “I want to fly in the sky,” she said. “If I could, I’d go to the West Bank.”', 'To See the Best Christmas Trees, You’ll Need Scuba Gear - The New York TimesYour Christmas tree is nice — really, it is. It’s just the right height and shape, so green, and it smells so good. You definitely picked the best one in all of the land.But that’s where you messed up.The most beautiful Christmas trees don’t grow in soil. They’re not even plants. And you shouldn’t take them home or decorate them.Allow me to introduce a sea creature that will put your Christmas tree to shame: It’s name is Spirobranchus giganteus, but most people call it the Christmas tree worm.These animals live on coral reefs in tropical and subtropical waters around the world, building tiny, tubular homes with their own secretions of calcium carbonate. They emerge from these tubes to filter feed, procreate and breathe with a part of their body called the branchial crown.You can’t miss these bright, spiral-shaped cones while snorkeling, if you know what to look for. They look like miniature decorated firs.“They’re really pretty, very colorful, very festive and Christmassy,” said Orly Perry, a marine biologist studying them as a doctoral student at Bar-Ilan University in Israel.Most of the “trees,” which come in pairs, protrude no more than an inch from the tube’s opening. But they make up for small size with colorful displays that look like the work of a talented candymaker. Many spiral out in a mixture of purples, greens and whites where Mrs. Perry works on the Gulf of Aqabain the Red Sea near Eilat, Israel. But they come in many other colors, too, and some even don an appropriate solid winter white.Male and female Christmas tree worms reproduce by casting their sperm and eggs into the water in synchrony. Fertilized eggs develop into larvae that find a coral to make home.They don’t burrow into it. Instead, they latch on to a dead spot or wound and start making their tubes. By adjusting the tube’s growth rate to match the coral’s growth, the worm keeps up with the coral growing around its tube and maintains an entrance to its home.Settled Christmas tree worms stay for life — up to 30 or 40 years. “They cannot say ‘this is not for me’ and move,” said Mrs. Perry. “It’s crucial to look for the right place.”These places aren’t random. The larvae seem to know which corals are which. Some worms of the Spirobranchus genus prefer certain coral species or types, typically less aggressive ones. And a few like artificial surfaces. Mrs. Perry found a potentially new species in the Gulf of Eilat that prefers plastic buoys and pieces of metal on piers and staircases.The larvae may follow signals from elderly worms to locations that have worked well for others of their genus. In those preferred habitats, they grow big. “This is kind of like humans. If you stick around in a place you feel comfortable, then everything is happy,” she said. “In the case of the worms, it affects their size.”Corals benefit, too. Researchers have found that Christmas tree worms may protect some corals from bleaching, algal smothering and predation from animals like crown-of-thorns starfish.Once stuck, Christmas tree worms can’t run, but they can hide. Sensing touch, chemicals and light, they can perceive danger. When it approaches, the worms retract, vanish into their homes and slam shut an organ called an operculum — just like a door.But the worms spend most time out of their tubes feeding, all year, day or night: which kind of means for corals, it’s Christmas all the time.For a spectacular display, experienced snorkelers can head out at night with a UV flashlight when their coral neighborhoods fluoresce.', '', "JERUSALEM – Palestinians are expected to protest en masse across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip following the Trump administration's recognition this week of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.Israeli police have deployed reinforcements in and around Jerusalem's Old City ahead of Friday prayers, though Israel hasn't imposed age restrictions on Muslim worshippers to access Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, the city's most sacred Islamic site — a measure common during flare-ups of tensions.Demonstrations in solidarity are also expected across the Middle East and many Muslim nations. In Malaysia, more than 1,000 Muslims have protested outside the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur.Trump's declaration on Jerusalem departed from decades of U.S. policy and upended longstanding international assurances that the fate of the city would be determined in negotiations.", 'What Does Jerusalem, or Al Quds, Mean to You? - The New York TimesThe Reader Center is a newsroom initiative that is helping The Times build deeper ties with our audience.With President Trump’s announcement yesterday that the United States now formally recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and will move its embassy there, many readers have taken to our comments section to express either their consternation or approval.However, few readers have commented about their personal experiences with the city.Perhaps you have lived there, have ancestral roots there or have visited. We want to hear what the city means to you. We may publish a selection of the responses.', 'JERUSALEM – If President Donald Trump moves to scuttle the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, Israel\'s nationalist government can be expected to be the loudest — and perhaps only — major player to applaud.But the true picture is more complicated than what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might portray: There is a strong sense among his own security establishment that there are few good alternatives, that the deal has benefited Israel, and that U.S. credibility could be squandered in the turbulent Middle East in ways that could harm Israel itself.That is not to say that Israel\'s respected security chiefs are all pleased with every aspect of the Iran deal. But after Netanyahu declared at the United Nations last month that it was time to "fix it or nix it," the prevailing attitude among security officials seems to be that fixing it is the best way to go."It seems to me that the less risky approach is to build on the existing agreement, among other reasons because it does set concrete limitations on the Iranians," said Uzi Arad, a former national security adviser to Netanyahu. "It imposes ceilings and benchmarks and verification systems that you do not want to lose. Why lose it?"Israel considers Iran to be its greatest foe, citing its decades of hostile rhetoric, support for anti-Israel militant groups and its development of long-range missiles. Israeli decision-makers see a nuclear-armed Iran as an existential threat.With Iran believed to be rapidly closing in on developing nuclear weapons, then-President Barack Obama led a coalition of world powers, including Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China, to the nuclear agreement in 2015. The deal offered Iran relief from crippling economic sanctions in exchange for strict limits on its nuclear program.As the deal was being finalized, Netanyahu frantically tried to block it, claiming it did not go far enough. Among his concerns: clauses that will lift the restrictions on Iran next decade, quick relief from sanctions, an imperfect system of inspections and the failure to address Iran\'s other belligerent behavior such as missile tests and involvement in regional conflicts. Netanyahu\'s opposition was so intense that he delivered a speech to the U.S. Congress railing against the emerging deal in early 2015, setting off a crisis in relations with Obama that never healed.On the campaign trail last year, Trump frequently criticized the Iran deal and vowed to rip it up if he was elected. In his own speech to the U.N. last month, Trump called it "one of the worst and most one-sided transactions" in U.S. history. Netanyahu said he had never heard a "bolder or more courageous speech" at the U.N.Following up on his U.N. performance, Trump is scheduled to deliver a speech Thursday in which he is expected to "decertify" the nuclear deal by claiming that Iran has not upheld the spirit of the agreement.This would not immediately pull the U.S. out of the deal. Instead, it would kick it over to Congress, which will then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. If that happens, Iran has threatened to walk away.Most of Trump\'s top national security aides do not want to dismantle the nuclear deal, and America\'s European allies have also urged the Trump administration not to walk away.Netanyahu\'s office said he discussed the matter of decertification with Trump when they met last month, but gave no further details. But he is likely to praise any move toward scrapping the nuclear deal.In an opinion column published in The New York Times last week, Michael Oren, Netanyahu\'s former ambassador to Washington and now a deputy minister for diplomacy, argued that decertification would not be the disaster that critics have predicted.He said if the deal is ultimately canceled, it should be replaced by "crippling sanctions." If retained, he said it should be improved to include stricter inspections of suspect nuclear sites, harsh penalties for violations, and eliminating the "sunset clause" that will gradually end the deal."Either way, revisiting the agreement will send an unequivocal message to the world," Oren said. "It will say that the United States is truly unwilling to accept a nuclear Iran — not now, not in a decade, not ever."As Trump\'s decision nears, however, a number of prominent security experts in Israel are publicly and privately advocating that the deal be left intact and its shortcomings addressed separately.These experts say that the U.S., in consultation with Israel, should work with its allies to engage Iran on their many concerns. Simply walking away would hurt American credibility and put it at odds not only with Iran, but with its partners who remain committed to the deal."You cannot reverse that easily without paying a price," said Arad, Netanyahu\'s former security adviser. "It would simply be a suboptimal and riskier route to go. So I say build on it, reinforce it, enforce it and address other issues without causing kind of self-inflicted losses in the process."Arad said that while there is a healthy debate over how to move forward, he believes that based on his discussions with both retired and active security officials, the prevailing view among experts on the issue is that the deal should be preserved.Top military officials, for instance, say that Iran has scrupulously upheld its commitments in the deal. This calm on the nuclear front has allowed them to focus on their other concerns about Iranian behavior, most critically its involvement in neighboring Syria and its support for the powerful Lebanese militant group Hezbollah."The Iran deal is a deal that contains both problems and shortcomings, but its advantages outweigh the weaknesses by far," said Efraim Halevy, a former director of the Mossad intelligence service.Yaakov Amidror, another former national security adviser to Netanyahu, said he did not think that scrapping the deal is even possible, given the position of America\'s partners. "What should be done is to enhance it. Make it a much better agreement," he said.Yoel Guzansky, a former Iran specialist on the Israeli National Security Council, said that sending the deal to Congress is a "hasty" decision that could backfire.He said the best way to gain leverage over Iran and alter its behavior is through concerted international action. Working together, he said, the international community could pursue various options, including diplomacy, a U.N. resolution or even threatening military action."We need to build an international coalition, which we lack right now. No one except Trump and Netanyahu, with all due respect, is supporting this move right now," said Guzansky, a senior fellow at INSS, a prominent Israeli think tank. "I really hope the two gentlemen have a program."Chemi Shalev, a columnist with the Haaretz daily, said Netanyahu was playing with fire by pushing Washington to break an agreement."Washington\'s signature on any accord will be significantly devalued, and its demands for new agreements with Iran, North Korea or for Middle East peace would henceforth be greeted with polite mockery," he said.Dan Shapiro, who served as Obama\'s ambassador to Israel when the deal was negotiated, said the lack of alternatives and the uncertainty that canceling the deal would bring are causes of great concern to the Israeli security establishment."They don\'t know what will happen if the deal unravels, but it\'s much more likely that they\'re going to be faced with their decision point on Iranian nuclear capability much sooner without the deal than with it," he said.___Associated Press writer Ian Deitch in Jerusalem contributed.', "University of California at Berkeley has an eight-week delay on 'high profile' campus speakers. Legal scholar Alan Dershowitz believes that may be a violation of first amendment rights and may sue over his right to speak. #TuckerI was recently invited to present the liberal case for Israel at Berkeley. In my remarks I advocated the establishment of a Palestinian state and a negotiated end of the conflict. I encouraged hostile questions from protestors and answered all of them. The audience responded positively to the dialogue. Then immediately after my address, a poster was plastered outside Berkeley Law School with a swastika drawn on my face.The Dean of Berkeley Law School, Erwin Cherwinsky, sent a letter to the law school community condemning the swastika: “Several of our students expressed their disagreement with him [Dershowitz] and did so in a completely appropriate way that led to discussion and dialogue. I was pleased to hear of how this went, but then shocked to learn of the swastika drawn on a flyer that someone had posted about him.”This was posted at the Law School at @UCBerkeley where I spoke yesterday. A swastika is drawn over my face. pic.twitter.com/ILGWIZOc0QShortly after, The Daily Californian – Berkeley’s student newspaper – published an anti-Semitic cartoon, depicting an ugly caricature of me sticking my head through a cardboard cutout. Behind the cardboard I am portrayed stomping on a Palestinian child with my foot, while holding in my hand an Israeli soldier who is shooting an unarmed Palestinian youth. Above the cardboard cutout the title of my speech – The Liberal Case for Israel – is scrawled in capital letters.In a Letter to the Editor, the university’s Chancellor, Carol Christ, wrote the following:This sequence of events – by hard-left students who originally protested my right to speak at Berkeley– confirmed what I’ve long believed: that there is very little difference between the Nazis of the hard right and the anti-Semites of the hard left. “Your recent editorial cartoon targeting Alan Dershowitz was offensive, appalling and deeply disappointing. I condemn its publication. Are you aware that its anti-Semitic imagery connects directly to the centuries-old “blood libel” that falsely accused Jews of engaging in ritual murder? I cannot recall anything similar in the Daily Cal, and I call on the paper’s editors to reflect on whether they would sanction a similar assault on other ethnic or religious groups. We cannot build a campus community where everyone feels safe, respected and welcome if hatred and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes become an acceptable part of our discourse.”It is shocking that this vile caricature – which would fit comfortably in a Nazi publication – was published in “the official paper of record of the City of Berkeley” (according to the Editor). The cartoon resembles the grotesque anti-Semitic blood libel propaganda splashed across Der Sturmer in the 1930’s, which depicted Jews drinking the blood of gentile children. Canards about Jews as predators – prominently promulgated by the Tzarist forgery, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion – were anti-Semitic back then and are still anti-Semitic today, whether espoused by the extreme left or the extreme right.Editorial Cartoon | Behind the scenes https://t.co/uO0B0PJ6V5This sequence of events – by hard-left students who originally protested my right to speak at Berkeley– confirmed what I’ve long believed: that there is very little difference between the Nazis of the hard right and the anti-Semites of the hard left. There is little doubt that this abhorrent caricature was a hard-left Neo-Nazi expression.These anti-Semitic displays against me were in reaction to a speech in which I advocated a Palestinian state, an end to the occupation and opposition to Israeli settlement policies. Many on the hard-left refuse to acknowledge this sort of nuanced positioning. That is because their hostility towards Israel does not stem from any particular Israeli actions or policies. Even if Israel were to withdraw from the West Bank, destroy the security barrier, and recognize Hamas as a legitimate political organization, it would still not be enough. For these radicals, it is not about what Israel does; it is about what Israel is: the nation state of the Jewish people. To many on the hard left, Israel is an imperialistic, apartheid, genocidal, and colonialist enterprise that must be destroyed.Nonetheless, just as I defended the rights of Nazis to march in Skokie, I defend the right of hard-left bigots to produce this sort of anti-Semitic material, despite it being hate speech. Those who condemn hate speech when it comes from the right should also speak up when hate speech comes from the left. The silence from those on the left is steeped in hypocrisy. It reflects the old adage: free speech for me but not for thee.To be sure, the students had the right to publish this cartoon, but they also had the right not to publish it. I am confident that if the shoe were on the other foot – if a cartoon of comparable hate directed against women, gays, blacks or Muslims were proposed – they would not have published it. There is one word for this double standard. It’s called bigotry.The best response to bigotry is the opposite of censorship: it is exposure and shaming in the court of public opinion. The offensive cartoon should not be removed, as some have suggested. It should be widely circulated along with the names prominently displayed of the anti-Semite who drew it and the bigoted editors who decided to publish it. Every potential employer or admissions officer should ask them to justify their bigotry.Joel Mayorga is the anti-Semitic cartoonist. Karim Doumar (Editor in Chief and President), Alexandra Yoon-Hendricks (Managing Editor) and Suhauna Hussain (Opinion Editor) head the editorial board that oversaw the decision to publish it. They must be held accountable for their reprehensible actions. I challenge them to justify their bigotry. It will not be enough to hide behind the shield of freedom of speech, because that freedom also entails the right not to publish anti-Semitic expression, if they would refuse to publish other bigoted expression.After I submitted a draft of this op-ed to the Daily Cal, the paper tried to censor my piece in a self-serving way by omitting my characterization of the cartoonist as an anti-Semite. As far as I know they did not edit the offending cartoon. Also, the editor claimed that the intent of the cartoon was to expose the “hypocrisy” of my talk. Yet, the newspaper never even reported on the content of my talk and I don’t know whether the cartoonist was even at my talk. The cartoon was clearly based on a stereotype not on the content of my talk. Alan M.

Most recent administrations have done the same, and all have failed. Will Mr. Trump do any better?The specifics of the initiative are still being hammered out, but some elements are clear. Most administrations start with modest proposals to build trust between the parties and then, when these efforts have bred mutual suspicion and disappointment, they propose a framework for an agreement just as the process moves toward collapse. Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, the chief negotiator, have done the reverse, hinting that Washington will lay down the principles of an agreement at the outset of talks, but without imposing them on either party.A two-state solution might not be in the cards. While talks toward a plan move forward, the administration will undertake a series of confidence-building measures; these might include a Palestinian pledge to resume security cooperation with Israel in return for the transfer of a bit of land to the Palestinian Authority, a limited settlement freeze and economic aid for West Bank Palestinians. This is standard fare.Mr. Trump will also try to regionalize the process. In exchange for Israeli flexibility, Arab countries in the Sunni coalition — notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — would extend privileges that Israel has long coveted, including overflight and perhaps some sort of diplomatic status, and offer lavish funding to prop up the Palestinian entity that signs an agreement with Israel. The Obama administration attempted to elicit Saudi involvement, too, but King Abdullah rejected its proposal. As the process evolves, the particulars of these canonical provisions will change as well.In addition, on Wednesday Mr. Trump conferred American recognition on Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and announced that the Embassy will be moved to Jerusalem. He did not, however, define what he meant by “Jerusalem,” only defining it as an Israeli capital whose boundaries have yet to be negotiated with Palestinians. It is therefore unclear what precisely has been formally recognized.It is possible that Mr. Trump is attempting to lure Israel into concessions through this policy departure and maybe even trap Mr. Netanyahu into responding in kind. But the emptiness of the gesture suggests otherwise. One thing that the announcement will have done is to shore up the president’s evangelical base, who won’t inquire too closely into the practical import of the announcement but will be seduced by the headlines it generates.The Trump administration seems to believe that after a half-century of failed peace initiatives, the stars have finally aligned. And it’s not entirely wrong.Israel and Saudi Arabia, for example, have forged a cooperative relationship that could provide Arab cover for a deal on Israeli terms. Indeed, there are unconfirmed rumors that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has told the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, to agree to an Israeli offer or resign. By isolating the Palestinians, Saudi cover would work in the same way that Egyptian cover enabled Menachem Begin to deflect Jimmy Carter’s push for Palestinian autonomy at Camp David.Bill Clinton’s prioritization of an Israel-Syria agreement was meant to weaken Mr. Abbas’s predecessor, Yasir Arafat, who lamented his reduced position by labeling himself “the other woman.” Egypt and Israel, moreover, can now exert pressure on Hamas to pursue reconciliation with West Bank moderates, that way disarming — in theory — Gaza-based rejectionists.Furthermore, Washington’s assertive stance toward Iran has long been urged by Israel, which has hinted now and then that American pressure on Iran might prompt Israeli concessions to Palestinians. So there might be an opening for a quid pro quo. And, the thinking goes, if Richard Nixon’s anti-Communist credentials gave him the credibility to stage an opening to China, President Trump’s pro-Israeli, pro-Saudi and anti-Iranian positions might enable him to persuade Israel to consider serious compromise.Finally, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is in serious political trouble, and should he fall, his successor might adopt a more flexible attitude.This is a superficially impressive case, but the whole is far less than the sum of its parts. First, the Saudis are unlikely to pay Israel for something they already get free. The Israeli Foreign Ministry, for example, has already instructed its diplomats to lobby on behalf of Saudi Arabia’s tough talk on Lebanon. Israel will encourage an aggressive American stance toward Iran whether or not the Saudis take a tough line with Palestinian leaders.Second, Hamas will not play dead just because it is under pressure to proceed with reconciliation. And the moderates lack the capacity to govern Gaza, in any case. Their latest waltz is unlikely to culminate in betrothal.Third, an American crackdown on Iran is unlikely to yield Israeli accommodation of Palestinian goals. Quite the opposite: Israeli leaders believe that if they can prevail on Mr. Trump on confronting Iran, they can win on the peace process, too. And if Mr. Netanyahu does fall, there is scant evidence that his successor will be more open to concessions to the Palestinians.The larger point is that successive peace process efforts have failed not because of avoidable misunderstandings, inept negotiating tactics, diplomatic blunders or bad luck. They have failed because neither side wants an agreement on anything like the other side’s terms. (And this is all separate from Mr. Trump’s unfocused volatility, not to mention his ill-timed plan to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Such recognition limited to West Jerusalem might make sense to clinch Israel’s buy-in at the endgame of a negotiation, but not at the very outset, when an ill-defined pledge will antagonize Palestinians and most likely inflame the Arab world.)The obstacles are structural. On the whole, Israeli voters are more right-wing, more religious, less well educated and more mistrustful of Arabs than they were in the past. The Orthodox Jewish population on the West Bank is growing rapidly, twice as fast as the Palestinian population. Sophisticated surveys also show that Israelis are generally happy with their lives; they will not welcome disruption.Israel remains much more powerful than the Palestinians and in firm control of Palestinian territories. Accordingly, many Israelis do not perceive a need to give up the West Bank, divide Jerusalem or accept the security risks implied by withdrawal because they regard such concessions as both morally wrong and practically unnecessary. Mr. Netanyahu is reported to believe that liberal American Jews will disappear in the next generation or two and that evangelicals and Orthodox Jews will be strong enough to immunize Israel against American pressure. Israel, in other words, is willing to wait it out.On the other side, many Palestinians have discarded the idea of a Palestinian state. The alternatives they have are the status quo, the forlorn hope for Israeli citizenship or, for those with the energy and resources, emigration to Jordan and then, maybe, to the wider Arab world. Europe and the United States are no longer welcoming destinations. Political violence is also an option.Last, a successful peace effort would require the president to lean heavily on Israel, rope in Arab states as deep-pocketed honest brokers and collaborate with leaders on both sides who can deliver in the face of strong — even violent — domestic opposition. There is no such Israeli leadership on the horizon, nor is there any on the Palestinian side as Mr. Abbas prepares his exit.Nor is American pressure in the cards. For all the talk from successive administrations, a Palestinian-Israeli peace has never been a strategic imperative for Washington. Thus, no administration has been willing to incur the domestic political costs entailed by an imposed agreement along the lines the Trump administration has already disavowed. When strategic interests do come into play, the United States has consistently pursued its own interest, as when it blocked Israeli aircraft from Iraqi airspace during Desert Storm or refused to strike Iran in 2012.There is no reason to believe that the Trump administration is insincere in its pursuit of an agreement. But against the deeper structures underlying the surface reality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is highly unlikely that Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt will make much of a dent.', '', 'U.S. to Recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s Capital, Trump Says, Alarming Middle East Leaders - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump plans to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the American Embassy there, upending nearly seven decades of American foreign policy and potentially destroying his efforts to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians.Mr. Trump’s decision, a high-risk foray into the thicket of the Middle East, was driven not by diplomatic calculations but by a campaign promise. He appealed to evangelicals and ardently pro-Israel American Jews in 2016 by vowing to move the embassy, and advisers said on Tuesday he was determined to make good on his word.But the president, faced with a deadline of this past Monday to make that decision, still plans to sign a national security waiver to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for an additional six months, even as he set in motion a plan to move it to Jerusalem. Officials said the process would take several years.More significantly, Mr. Trump is set to announce his formal recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital in a formal speech at the White House on Wednesday, when he will become the first American president to take that step since the founding of Israel in 1948.The Times will have live coverage of the address, which is scheduled to take place at 1 p.m. Eastern time in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. Follow along for the latest updates.Mr. Trump spent Tuesday morning explaining the policy change in telephone calls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel; Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president; and to Arab leaders who warned him that it would disrupt the peace process, perhaps fatally, and could unleash a new wave of violence across the region.“Moving the U.S. embassy is a dangerous step that provokes the feelings of Muslims around the world,” King Salman of Saudi Arabia told Mr. Trump in their call, according to Saudi state television.Late on Tuesday, Palestinian national and Islamic groups issued a joint statement calling for three days of “popular anger” to protest Mr. Trump’s move, beginning on Wednesday throughout the Palestinian territories and in demonstrations at United States embassies and consulates around the world.Fearing attacks, the American consulate in Jerusalem barred employees and family members from going to the Old City or the West Bank, while the State Department urged embassies around the world to tighten their security.Jerusalem is one of the world’s most fiercely contested swaths of real estate, with both sides disputing each other’s claims. West Jerusalem is the seat of Israel’s government, but the Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state, and most of the world considers it occupied territory. Jerusalem’s Old City has the third-holiest mosque in Islam and the holiest site in Judaism, making the city’s status a sensitive issue for Muslims and Jews worldwide alike.Mr. Trump’s decision drew applause from some in Israel and the United States, even if Mr. Netanyahu and the Israeli government were studiously silent in advance of the president’s speech.“The U.S. recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital is a positive and important step, particularly amid Palestinian efforts to undermine the historic ties between the Jewish nation and the City of David,” said Amos Yadlin, executive director of Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies.Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, said, “It is high time to move the embassy to Jerusalem.” He added, “Not moving it to Jerusalem for 22 years has not brought us closer to peace.”White House officials said Mr. Trump remained committed to what he has called the “ultimate deal” between Israel and the Palestinians. The decision, they said, was “recognition of current and historic reality.” They said it could hasten, rather than impede, peace negotiations by removing a source of ambiguity from the American position.Mr. Trump, officials said, would make clear that the United States is not taking a position on whether, or how, Jerusalem is divided between Israel and the Palestinians. He will also not take a position on a disputed area of the Old City, known as the Temple Mount to Jews and the Haram al-Sharif to Muslims, which has been a flash point for tensions.But even with those caveats, Mr. Trump’s decision seems likely to disrupt, if not dissolve, the peace effort. Administration officials said they expected the Palestinians to walk away from the process, at least for now. The White House is girding itself for an eruption of violence, coordinating plans with several agencies to protect American citizens abroad.“You can finesse this all you want, but Jerusalem doesn’t allow for any finesse,” said Martin S. Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel. “They can try to limit the damage all they want, but they won’t be able to, because Jerusalem is such a hot-button issue.”To some extent, Mr. Trump’s willingness to take such a risk underscores how little progress his peace negotiators — led by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner — have made. Six months ago, when the president last had to decide whether to sign a waiver to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv, Mr. Kushner prevailed on Mr. Trump to do so, in the interest of the peace process.Since then, however, the administration’s efforts have shown little evidence of narrowing the differences between Israelis and Palestinians. Mr. Kushner and Jason D. Greenblatt, the president’s special envoy, supported Mr. Trump’s decision, officials said.Mr. Trump’s pledge was extremely popular with evangelicals and pro-Israel backers, including the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who donated $25 million to a political action committee supporting Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. Mr. Adelson expressed anger when Mr. Trump signed the waiver in June to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv.The White House, which has done little to lay the groundwork for the move, on Tuesday contacted pro-Israel leaders from the Jewish and Christian communities to invite them to a conference call set for Wednesday afternoon, according to an invitee who spoke about it on condition of anonymity because he did not want to jeopardize his relationship with Mr. Trump’s team.Mr. Klein was among several supporters who questioned why the embassy move would take several years. Former diplomats have said that the United States could relocate the embassy simply by hanging a new sign outside the American consulate in Jerusalem.White House officials, however, said the administration’s lawyers concluded that would not be in compliance with a 1995 law, under which Congress instructed the president to move the embassy and required him to sign a waiver every six months to delay it. Legally, the officials said, the United States would have to move embassy staff into the building as well.Reaction to Mr. Trump’s move in the Arab world was swift and negative, even from normally friendly leaders.King Abdullah II of Jordan strongly cautioned against the move, “stressing that Jerusalem is the key to achieving peace and stability in the region and the world,” according to a statement from the royal palace in Amman. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is the custodian of Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.“King Abdullah stressed that the adoption of this resolution will have serious implications for security and stability in the Middle East, and will undermine the efforts of the American administration to resume the peace process and fuel the feelings of Muslims and Christians,” the statement said.Few details of the conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Abbas were released, but a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization said the call had given shape to the worst fears of Palestinians.“It’s very serious,” said the P.L.O. spokesman, Xavier Abu Eid. “Things look very bad.” The Palestinian news agency, WAFA, quoted Mr. Abbas’s spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, as saying that Mr. Abbas will continue his contacts with world leaders to prevent such “unacceptable action.”King Abdullah also spoke with Mr. Abbas, assuring him of Jordan’s support for the Palestinians “in preserving their historic rights in Jerusalem and the need to work together to confront the consequences of this decision,” it said.Mr. Trump, officials said, assured Mr. Abbas that the administration would protect Palestinian interests in any peace negotiation with Israel. He also invited the Palestinian leader to visit him in Washington for further consultations. Mr. Abbas said he could not come for a while.', 'Emmanuel Macron Warns Trump Over Plan to Recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s Capital - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump’s plan to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel ran into mounting resistance abroad on Monday, with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, warning him it was a bad idea.Mr. Macron joined leaders from Jordan, Egypt, Turkey and the Arab League in speaking out against the move, which would overturn decades of American policy. People briefed on the deliberations said Mr. Trump planned to address the issue in a speech on Wednesday, but they cautioned he could still change course.In a phone call with the president, Mr. Macron “expressed his concern with the possibility that the United States might unilaterally recognize Jerusalem as capital of the State of Israel,” according to a statement issued by the French government.“Mr. Macron,” the statement said, “reaffirmed that the status of Jerusalem must be resolved through peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, and particularly those relating to the establishment of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security with Jerusalem as their capital.”American presidents have also long taken the view that Jerusalem’s status needed to be worked out by two parties. But Mr. Trump promised during the 2016 presidential campaign to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.Under a law passed in 1995, the president has to sign a national security waiver every six months to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv, and that deadline expired Monday. The White House said Mr. Trump took no action on Monday, but would announce his decision soon.“The president has been clear on this issue from the get-go that it’s not a matter of if, but a matter of when,” the deputy press secretary, Hogan Gidley, told reporters.Mr. Trump, officials said, is expected to sign the waiver but couple it with recognition of Jerusalem as the capital — a move that the White House hopes will mollify evangelicals and other staunchly pro-Israel supporters.Mr. Macron’s objections are hardly a surprise. European leaders agree that Jerusalem’s status should be decided in a peace negotiation. France nourishes its own ambitions as a peacemaker: It played host to a Middle East peace conference shortly before Mr. Trump took office.One influential country that has not weighed in on the possible shift in American policy is Saudi Arabia. That is surprising given that Jerusalem is home to the Aqsa Mosque, and that the Saudi king holds the title of custodian of Islam’s two other holiest mosques, in Mecca and Medina.“The silence from Riyadh is deafening,” said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East peace negotiator now at the Wilson Center. “Either they know the president won’t issue a statement or they’re privy to some initiative, of which the Jerusalem gambit is a part.”The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, is close to Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is running the administration’s peace initiative. Diplomats in the region have been buzzing that the crown prince recently presented the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, with the outlines of an American plan — something the Saudis and the White House deny.Mr. Macron has also developed a good relationship with Mr. Trump, particularly since he invited the president to Paris last July for Bastille Day celebrations. But the two leaders are far apart on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal.Some experts say Mr. Trump will find it impossible to square his campaign promise with his goal of brokering the “ultimate deal” between Israelis and Palestinians.“You can’t either move the embassy or even declare Jerusalem the capital without driving the Palestinians away from the negotiating table, and winning them the support of the Arabs in doing so,” said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to Israel and Egypt.', 'A Wary Response, So Far, on Trump’s Expected Recognition of Jerusalem - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — There were warnings of a new Palestinian uprising and calls for protests at United States embassies, dire predictions that hopes for peace would be dashed irretrievably — and expressions of relief from Israelis who have waited a half-century for the world to remove the asterisk next to this city’s name.Yet on the whole, the responses in the region to reports that President Trump will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel — something no president has done in the nearly 70 years since Israel’s founding — remained hedged, if not entirely restrained, on Saturday. Arabs and Israelis alike were impatient to see whether Mr. Trump would really do it, precisely how he would define Jerusalem, and what else he might say or do to qualify the change.Mr. Trump’s announcement, expected in a speech on Wednesday, would amount to the not-quite fulfillment of a campaign promise to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a step for which many of Mr. Trump’s Jewish and evangelical supporters, and their allies in the Israeli right wing, have been clamoring.For Israelis, it would acknowledge the obvious: that their government sits in Jerusalem, mainly on its western side — though the United States, along with the rest of the world, has not recognized the Holy City as Israeli territory, particularly since the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, when Israel conquered East Jerusalem.“That Trump will declare it? I’m glad, in case anyone was in any doubt,” said Betty Mizrahi, 40, a government worker living in Har Homa, a neighborhood built on captured territory. “Jerusalem was always the capital. That people deny it is another matter.”Yet of all the issues that have defied resolution despite decades of talks between Palestinians and Israelis, the final status of Jerusalem — with its sites holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims, and warring claims dating back to the Crusades and the Romans — has been uniquely nettlesome.The United States has taken pains to refrain from recognizing the Holy City as Israel’s capital precisely to avoid being seen as prejudging the outcome of peace talks, in which Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the seat of their eventual government.Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s executive committee, said dispensing with that longstanding reticence would reveal the United States as “so incredibly one-sided and biased” that it “would be the total annihilation of any chances of peace, or any American role in peacemaking.”“They’re sending a clear message to the world: We’re done,” she said.While physically moving the embassy would require little more than putting a new sign on existing American consular offices in Jerusalem, Mr. Trump’s declaring Jerusalem the capital would carry great symbolic power, Palestinian officials said.“If anything, it is worse, actually,” said Nasser al-Kidwa, a member of the central committee of Fatah, the dominant P.L.O. faction, and a nephew of Yasir Arafat, its onetime leader. Recognition matters, he said, “not the stones” of an embassy building.Ahmed Yousef, an adviser to Ismail Haniya, leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, was similarly critical of Mr. Trump’s expected declaration. “I don’t understand why he wants to antagonize over a billion Muslims around the world,” he said.The specific way in which Mr. Trump makes his declaration, however, could mean a significantly different response on both sides of the conflict.If he just refers to “Jerusalem” as Israel’s capital, or refers to the city’s present municipal borders, Mr. Trump would be likely to set off a strong backlash in much of the Arab world, analysts said.“For Palestinians, this will be perceived as dividing the cake while negotiating over it,” said Ofer Zalzberg, a Jerusalem-based analyst at International Crisis Group.Ms. Ashrawi warned it could lead to repercussions “that would not be easily contained,” including violence: “To people who are looking for an excuse, this would be a ready-made excuse.”Any move by the United States to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital would fuel extremism and violence, the secretary general of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said on Saturday, according to Reuters.If Mr. Trump were to limit his statement to West Jerusalem, however, it would likely antagonize supporters in the pro-Israel camp, by undercutting their claim to a united capital throughout the city and acknowledging Palestinian designs on East Jerusalem.Any attempt at deliberate ambiguity is unlikely to fly because the United States will be forced to specify the territorial definition of Jerusalem that the president was relying upon, said Daniel Shapiro, who was President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Israel.“It accomplishes so little that I wonder if it’s worth that headache,” he said.The timing of Mr. Trump’s declaration was baffling both to those who warned against it and some who welcomed it.Both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are awaiting a proposal by Mr. Trump’s administration to restart the peace process. And recent meetings in Riyadh between Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and, in turn, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, have fueled speculation that Mr. Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed are trying to push through a plan.Given the prince’s eagerness to combat Iran, Palestinians are concerned he could embrace a proposal unfavorable to them, for an alliance with Israel against Iran.But Arab governments, even Saudi Arabia’s, could be compelled to rebuke a declaration of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, experts said.“Pushing this issue now, in advance of a peace process at a time when the administration has zero credibility on this issue, at a time when it wants to engage the Saudis, makes absolutely no sense,” said Aaron David Miller, a former Mideast peace negotiator under past Republican and Democratic administrations. “It’s a self-inflicted wound.”Perhaps no Arab leader has more at risk in a cementing of Israel’s hold on Jerusalem as its capital than King Abdullah II of Jordan, whose dynasty has defined itself as the custodian of Al Aqsa, a holy site revered by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and by Jews as the Temple Mount. While the king can fire subordinates who fail him, he is viewed as personally responsible for Al Aqsa, said Mr. Zalzberg, and Mr. Trump’s declaration “could contribute dramatically to the erosion of the king’s popularity and legitimacy.”Abdullah has been in Washington for more than a week, pressing the administration not to take this step, according to Arab news media. Petra, the Jordanian news agency, said the king had warned that changing the United States’ posture on Jerusalem would threaten a two-state solution and “could be potentially exploited by terrorists to stoke anger, frustration and desperation in order to spread their ideologies.”Palestinian officials across the political spectrum made similar warnings. In Gaza, Hamas issued a statement calling on Palestinians to “incite an uprising in Jerusalem so that this conspiracy does not pass.” Mr. Yousef, the adviser to the Hamas leader, said Mr. Trump’s move would drive up anti-American sentiment and “decimate whatever good will they have here.”And a Hamas representative based in Lebanon, Ali Barakeh, said the group would probably respond to Mr. Trump by calling for a new intifada, or uprising, and for Mr. Abbas to quit negotiations, “since the Americans won’t achieve anything for them.”But Ayman Rigib, a Fatah leader in Cairo, worried aloud that Mr. Abbas would not push back firmly enough. “This is a new low for us as Palestinians,” he said. “We are not only weak, we also have a leader who might actually accept this deal.”Along the 1967 line in a Jerusalem quieted by the Jewish Sabbath, Hani Juwaihan, 28, one of the relatively few East Jerusalem Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, said he wished Mr. Trump would leave well enough alone.“It’s not his right to decide,” said Mr. Juwaihan, who lives in the Al Thuri neighborhood of East Jerusalem but works as a cook at La-La Land, a restaurant near the beach in Tel Aviv.“If there’s peace, all well and good, we’ll live together without any problem,” he said. “But in the absence of peace, it’s not for Trump to decide. Jerusalem is a holy place. Nobody can decide.”', 'U.S. ambassador to Israel speaks exclusively to \'Fox & Friends\' on President Trump\'s decision.Amid mounting security concerns for personnel and citizens abroad, the U.S. government is requesting that Israel “restrain” its response to the news that Washington will recognize Jerusalem as the country’s capital,Reutersreported Thursday, citing a State Department document.The Dec. 6 document, which was sent to the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv and U.S. officials at several European embassies, specifically references Washington\'s concern about backlash in the Middle East.“We expect there to be resistance to this news in the Middle East and around the world," the document states, according to Reuters. "We are still judging the impact this decision will have on U.S. facilities and personnel overseas."The communique instructs U.S. diplomats to tell Israeli officials to moderate their enthusiasm, Reuters reported.“While I recognize that you will publicly welcome this news, I ask that you restrain your official response,” the document reads, outlining talking points for U.S. diplomats meeting with their Israeli counterparts.The document contained a message for diplomats based at several U.S. embassies throughout Europe as well.This is a historic day. Jerusalem has been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years. Jerusalem has been the focus of our hopes, our dreams, our prayers for three millennia. Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years.

It makes bold moves,” the document continues. “But it is bold moves that are going to be needed if peace efforts are finally going to be successful.”A second State Department document obtained by Reuters stated that the U.S. has set up a task force to “track worldwide developments” concerning its historic recognition of Jerusalem.Such task forces are typically established when there is concern for the security of U.S. workers or citizens abroad, Reuters reported, citing a government source.On Wednesday, Palestinian officials declared the Mideast peace process “finished” and Turkey announced it would host a meeting of Islamic nations next week to give Muslim countries’ leaders an opportunity to coordinate a response.The Arab League scheduled an emergency meeting on Saturday, and terror group Hamas is calling for a “day of rage” Friday."The youth and the Palestinian resistance in the West Bank need to respond with all means available to the U.S. decision that harms our Jerusalem,” Hamas said in a statement. “Jerusalem is a red line and the resistance will not allow any desecration of it.”The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state and fear that Trump’s declaration essentially imposes on them a disastrous solution for one of the core issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.“There is no way that there can be talks with the Americans. The peace process is finished. They have already pre-empted the outcome,” said Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi. “They cannot take us for granted.”The U.S. decision “destroys the peace process,” added Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Gregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

Israel is likewise worried about Hezbollah as well as efforts by Iran to establish a land corridor across southern Syria. If a war with Hezbollah broke out, it could scuttle any initiative with the Palestinians.Nonetheless, Mr. Trump’s team has collected “non-papers” exploring various issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and officials said they expected to address such perennial dividing points as the status of Jerusalem and settlements in the occupied West Bank. Although Mr. Trump has not committed to a Palestinian state, analysts said they anticipated that the plan will have to be built around the so-called two-state solution that has been the core of peacemaking efforts for years.“We have spent a lot of time listening to and engaging with the Israelis, Palestinians and key regional leaders over the past few months to help reach an enduring peace deal,” said Jason D. Greenblatt, the president’s chief negotiator. “We are not going to put an artificial timeline on the development or presentation of any specific ideas and will also never impose a deal. Our goal is to facilitate, not dictate, a lasting peace agreement to improve the lives of Israelis and Palestinians and security across the region.”Mr. Trump, who considers himself a dealmaker, decided to adopt the challenge when he took office in January, intrigued at the idea of succeeding where other presidents failed, and he assigned the effort to Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser. Neither had any background with the issue and the effort was greeted with scorn, but the fact that the president entrusted it to a close relative was taken as a sign of seriousness in the region.Mr. Trump’s team sees the convergence of factors that make the moment ripe, including an increased willingness by Arab states to finally solve the issue to refocus attention on Iran, which they consider the bigger threat. With that in mind, Egypt is brokering a reconciliation between Mahmoud Abbas, who presides in the West Bank, and Hamas, which controls Gaza, a deal that would cement the Palestinian Authority as the representative of the Palestinian people. Saudi Arabia has summoned Mr. Abbas to Riyadh to reinforce the importance of a deal.“The stars begin to align in a way that creates a moment,” said Nimrod Novik, a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum who served as foreign policy adviser to former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who negotiated the Oslo Accords in the 1990s. “But obviously the two key questions are will Prime Minister Netanyahu decide to go for it” and “will President Trump, once he’s presented a plan by his team, decide it’s worth the political capital required.”Still, neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel nor President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority is in a strong position to negotiate. Mr. Netanyahu faces corruption investigations and pressure from the right in his narrow coalition not to make concessions, while Mr. Abbas is aging and endures strong opposition among his own constituents.Skepticism abounds, especially among those who spent years struggling to overcome the same challenges with the same set of tools. President Barack Obama and his advisers debated for months putting forth their own parameters for a deal, ultimately outlining a general set of principles at the end of last year in a speech by Secretary of State John Kerry as time ran out on the administration.“There’s nothing new under the sun when it comes to Middle East peace,” said Philip Gordon, a White House Middle East coordinator under Mr. Obama. “When you get into these details, that’s when you come up against the strong objections of the two sides. If they don’t want it to be dead on arrival, they may wind up with vague principles, but as we’ve seen, even vague principles are beyond what the parties are willing to embrace.”Tamara Cofman Wittes, a State Department official under Mr. Obama, said both Israeli and Palestinian leaders “are heavily constrained” not only by their own governing coalitions but by suspicious and risk-averse publics. “It’s hard even for willing political leaders to make major concessions under those circumstances,” she said.The core four-member team drafting the plan includes Mr. Kushner, Mr. Greenblatt, Dina H. Powell, a deputy national security adviser, and David M. Friedman, the ambassador to Israel. They are consulting with Donald Blome, the consul general in Jerusalem, and others from the State Department and National Security Council. Officials said the effort may take until early next year.Mr. Trump and his team make no bones about being pro-Israel. The president has boasted of being Israel’s “biggest friend” and Mr. Kushner, Mr. Greenblatt and Mr. Friedman are all Orthodox Jews with ties to Israel. But Ms. Powell is an Egyptian-born Coptic Christian and Mr. Kushner has developed strong ties with the Saudis and other Arabs and recently returned from a visit to Riyadh. Mr. Trump has met with Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas three times each.The team has drawn praise from across the spectrum. “We do believe this is a historic opportunity, and we will spare no effort to support President Trump’s investment in a better future,” Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian Authority’s envoy to Washington, said in an interview. During a trip to London this month, Mr. Netanyahu said, “They are trying to think out of the box.”Barak Ravid, an Israeli journalist who has broken stories on the American effort, wrote in the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper last spring that Mr. Trump had “succeeded in bringing peace, which in recent years had become a dirty word, back to the center of Israeli public and political discourse.”But privately, officials from both sides express concern that Mr. Trump and his team are still naïve about the Middle East and ineffective in accomplishing their objectives.Dennis Ross, the veteran Middle East peace negotiator, said Mr. Trump’s team has “done a very good job of presenting themselves as having listened” and is now “taken seriously” in the region.The decision to present a concrete plan makes sense if ground is prepared in advance. “If you simply resume negotiations and nothing accompanies it, nobody will take it seriously,” Mr. Ross said. “People will say we’ve seen this movie before. You have to show people — no, something is different this time.”Some analysts said they believed Mr. Trump’s plan may come with confidence-building provisions that each side will already have agreed to. For Israel, it could include limiting settlement construction to current blocs without taking new land, recommitting to a two-state solution and redesignating a small part of the West Bank to give Palestinians more control.For the Palestinians, it could include resuming full security cooperation with Israel, holding off seeking further international recognition and ending payments to families of Palestinians imprisoned for terrorist attacks. Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, could add their own commitments, like overflights by Israeli passenger planes, visas for business people and telecommunications links.A White House official dismissed that as mere speculation. But the challenges of getting even to that stage are formidable, much less tackling harder questions.Mr. Zomlot, the Palestinian envoy, said any plan must establish a sovereign Palestinian state along the borders from before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war with East Jerusalem as its capital. “This is not our maximum. This is our minimum,” he said. “What everybody needs to understand is the historic compromise has already been made.”Israel’s allies in Washington are pressing from the other side. The House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday will consider a bill to cut aid to the Palestinian Authority unless it ends payments to families of Palestinian attackers.“If the Palestinians are going to be trustworthy partners in any kind of peace discussion, they have to show that they’re not inciting terrorism,” said Representative Doug Lamborn, a Republican from Colorado sponsoring the legislation. “And when you pay people — and, in fact, if you pay them more, the more Jews they kill — that’s pure incitement to terrorism.”Palestinian leaders say the payments are meant to help destitute families, not promote terrorism, and they accuse Israel of subsidizing violence by encouraging settlers in the West Bank. One compromise floated recently would have the Palestinian Authority help those families through a general welfare program that does not prioritize relatives of prisoners.Still, some analysts think Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas are simply playing along with the goal of ensuring the other is blamed when the process collapses.“The biggest impediment to the peace process is the two leaders,” said Grant Rumley, a scholar at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “Ultimately, both Netanyahu and Abbas just have this long, long history and they’ve played this game really well. And they don’t trust each other and I don’t think they will ever get to the point where they will trust each other.”', 'There Was No Peace Process for Trump to Destroy - The New York TimesMy colleagues Anne Barnard, Ben Hubbard and Declan Walsh captured well the Palestinian and Arab reaction to President Trump’s official recognition this week of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel: “An explosion of violence could still come,” they wrote, “but so far there is something more like an explosion of sighs.”Jerusalem, city of passions, has long been a tinderbox. The Second Intifada, or uprising, began in 2000 with Ariel Sharon’s provocative visit to the Temple Mount, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. But that was 17 years ago, when the Israeli-Palestinian conflict still stood at the core of Middle Eastern conflict, and Arab backing for the Palestinian cause was more than rhetorical.Ismail Haniya, the leader of Hamas, is now calling for a third intifada. But he’s up against exhaustion, cynicism and shifting priorities in the Arab world. Trump’s announcement did not destroy the “peace process.” There is no peace process to destroy.The Arab Spring has come and gone, and the Syrian state has gone, since the Second Intifada. Iran, the Shia enemy, looms much larger than the Palestinian cause for most Sunni Arab states. Everyone knows how much democratic legitimacy Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, has — none — and what purported reconciliation between his Fatah faction and Hamas is worth — very little.The Palestinian cause, undermined by disunity and the cultivation of victimhood, is weak and growing weaker. International indignation does not change that. Israeli force has been implacable.I confess to a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger reaction to Trump’s announcement. It did have the merit, as the president noted, of recognizing a reality, and that reality reflects perhaps the deepest of Jewish sentiments. It was, at least, not more of the same peace-process blather.Real frustration would require belief that maintaining the unresolved status of Jerusalem as a final-status bargaining chip in the “peace process” would make a decisive difference in that process. But, as noted above, there is none. If anything the “process” has been ideal camouflage for the steady growth in the number of Israeli settlers (now more than 600,000), favored by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government. It has given steady Israeli expansionism the international benediction of mythical reversibility. I am not convinced Trump gave a lot away.Well, some would argue, Trump put paid to any notion that the United States is an honest broker between Israel and the Palestinians. I don’t know anyone who believes that: America supports and favors Israel over the Palestinians for a variety of domestic political, strategic and sentimental reasons.Well, Trump has provoked the unswerving ire of the Palestinians (who now refuse to meet with Vice President Mike Pence during his upcoming visit) and destroyed any chance of peace. But there is nothing unswerving about Palestinian policy. It is big on rhetoric, feeble in action, reflecting powerlessness. Abbas will come around if the right offer ever comes along.Well, Trump undermined America’s international credibility and ability to lead. Sorry, he’s already done that many times over. American international authority is spent, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson discovered this week in Europe.Well, the president broke ranks with all major powers. In fact, he joined President Vladimir Putin. Earlier this year, Russia declared, “We view West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.”However, the Russian statement was more balanced. It also said, “We reaffirm our commitment to the U.N.-approved principles for a Palestinian-Israeli settlement, which include the status of East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state.”Israel, of course, claims all Jerusalem as its capital (including East Jerusalem, where more than 200,000 settlers live). The Palestinians will not accept a peace plan in which some part of Jerusalem is not their capital. Trump said his statement did not prejudge “the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem,” but its most damaging aspect was to give strong implicit backing to Israel’s claims, with no mention of Palestine’s. It also put American lives in danger and humiliated a people, the Palestinians, whose lives under a 50-year-old occupation are a daily exercise in humiliation. It flouted United Nations Security Council resolutions, so undermining international law.Trump’s was a silly, reckless gesture. What else is new?Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, is now supposed to produce his peace plan. Poor, pale, languid Jared! He will try to get his friends the Saudis to offer big blandishments to the Palestinians and Israel. That’s all he’s got. It won’t work. The Greater Israel project has gone too far for the “ultimate deal.”Since the killing of Yitzhak Rabin 22 years ago, at a moment when peace was within reach, the ethno-nationalist Israeli religious ideologues that believe all the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea was deeded to Israel in the Bible (and never mind who lives there now) have gotten the upper hand, with Netanyahu’s complicity. This was a successful assassination.These are the facts. Trump’s statement will not change them. It was directed largely at a domestic audience of evangelicals and major American Jewish groups. This, he said, was “a long overdue step to advance the peace process.” That’s nonsense. Sigh.', 'The Golden Age of ‘Existential’ Dread - The New York TimesLast month, after Hurricane Irma rolled over Florida, the state’s commissioner of agriculture took in the damage to citrus crops and deemed it “a unique and existential threat to the industry.” This was an alarming thing to say: Taken literally, it suggests that one of his state’s signature industries might cease to exist. And if it doesn’t sound alarming, perhaps that’s only because we’re surrounded on all sides with existential alarm, to the point where it feels almost like a tic to identify it. In the same month, a corporate lawyer, marveling at Equifax’s handling of an enormous data breach, called it “a botched response to an existential threat.” Climate change is considered an existential threat to all life on earth; a source in one news report deemed Brexit an existential threat to Irish beef exports.Through the whole late 20th century, “existential” floated through American conversation mostly as a kind of mush — a loose gesture in the general direction of a loosely grasped idea, something perhaps half-remembered from a film review or philosophy course, something about cigarette smoke and French intellectuals and the grim absurdity of constructing meaning in a universe totally indifferent to our presence. At the start of the ’60s, the Times critic John Leonard once wrote, “whenever something interesting happened in this country it was called ‘existential’\u2009” — there were “existential presidents, existential prize fights, existential murders, even existential architecture.” At the word’s baggiest, it becomes little more than an upscale synonym for “deep” — as when the protagonist of “Clueless” described the animated duo Ren and Stimpy as “way existential.”But citrus farmers and beef exporters are not, pretty obviously, reading Camus and struggling to create authentic modes of existence in an absurd vacuum of meaning; they are not pondering what it means to be, even in the Ren-and-Stimpyest sense. What we are talking about when we use the word today is something much more straightforward than continental philosophy. We are talking, for the most part, about whether a thing will continue to exist, or whether it might be at risk of going away.There are other ways to say this, but none seem as enjoyable. Calling something “a matter of life and death” sounds hysterical and alarmist; “existential threat” feels more solemn, gravely analytical, as if you’ve been poring over classified reports with world-weary experts. It is the verbal equivalent of a B-movie scientist somberly removing his glasses.We say it with abandon now, in every context, about the continued existence of big things and the continued existence of small ones. Artificial intelligence, says Elon Musk, may pose an existential threat to humanity — but also, say some medical professionals, to the significantly more limited field of human radiologists, who fear being replaced by software. Donald Trump’s control of the American nuclear arsenal, according to a psychiatrist named John Zinner, poses an existential threat to the world; to others, Facebook’s recent string of bad press presents an existential threat to a large company. (Tech businesses are rife with existential threats: Uber presents an existential threat to taxi services, but it also faces existential threats from potential regulation.) Brain injuries are an existential threat to the sport of football. Tax cuts are an existential issue for the Republican Party. Anything that has the potential to end can be matched with some factor that promises to hasten that end — and what is there in the universe that cannot, in theory, cease to exist?Our current use of “existential” is about as far removed from artsy-philosophical realms as you can imagine: It’s originally the province of defense analysts and foreign-policy think tanks, national-security types and people who write editorials about the Middle East peace process. In 1982, Chancellor Helmut Kohl described Soviet-American talks as having existential importance to West Germany. Through the 1990s, this was how pundits talked about Israel, a nation facing fairly unusual existential threats and conundrums. Debates about Israel seem to be the precise place where “existential anxiety” stopped referring to philosophical angst and started referring to the fear your nation could be destroyed.It was Sept. 11, 2001, that sent existential concerns slamming into American speech. But there was something new, something dissonant, in the way we began to use the word — a change meant to accommodate the idea that just 19 men might strike at a nation’s being. We’d been exposed to an event people found truly unimaginable, one that shifted their sense of the world and what seemed possible in it. And yet, disorientingly, day-to-day American life continued. No armies massed on the country’s borders. The nation felt itself plunged into momentous conflict, and yet so much of that conflict existed somewhere else — not just in remote places but in abstractions and arguments over what developments, far from any battlefield, would indicate that “the terrorists have won.”“There is no longer any doubt,” said Condoleezza Rice in 2002, “that today America faces an existential threat to our security.” The fight against terrorism, Vice President Dick Cheney said, was an “existential conflict.” It wasn’t that terrorists had any capacity to annihilate us, the way South Korea or Israel have feared the prospect of hostile, nuclear-armed neighbors; even our grimmest fears about dirty bombs and biological weapons did not remotely add up to the end of Western civilization. But some terrorists claimed to want to destroy us whole, and many Americans were happy to take up the fight on their terms. Existential conflict took a step back toward the abstract: Now it could be a fight not for our very being but about it.These two meanings have chased each other in circles for 15 years. Barack Obama, in an interview before his final State of the Union address last year, doggedly stuck to the more straightforward interpretation, professing that “there are no existential threats” to the United States — meaning, as he said in the address itself, that ISIS fighters, much as they might like to pretend so, “do not threaten our national existence.” A spokesman for Paul Ryan issued a rebuttal: “It’s absolutely clear that radical Islamic terrorists are determined to destroy the Western way of life.” They didn’t have to be capable of it; they just had to want it.In 2009, Michael B. Oren, soon to become Israel’s ambassador to the United States, wrote an essay for Commentary examining seven “existential” threats the nation faced — noting first how infrequently “modern states were threatened with their survival” or wars were fought “to eliminate another state and its people.” Foremost among them was the theoretical loss of Jerusalem, without which Israel would be “rendered soulless,” becoming “merely another Mediterranean enclave not worth living in.”This was an interesting shift in definition. It’s not that Israel would be — as is so often actively threatened — wiped from the map. But it would lose a thing many consider central to its essence, a thing without which it could no longer be considered itself. But what makes a thing itself? We’re brought right back to philosophical questions. What is a nation, really? Precisely what would have to change for America to no longer qualify, in your estimation, as America at all?It’s here that existential threats become subjective, that they lose their gravity and turn back into a vapor. For white nationalists, an America in which minorities mingle and miscegenate and share power with whites is an annihilating, nation-ending danger; for others, America cannot be itself until that happens. For the conservative columnist and radio host Dennis Prager, writing for TownHall in July, “left-wing-dominated media and universities pose an existential threat” to Western civilization — not because they seek to raze cities and scorch the earth, but because they envision it in ways Prager declines to recognize as the thing itself. For people of all stripes, the fear of seeing things destroyed has merged with the fear of seeing them made unrecognizable.Not 20 years ago, we seemed less apt to think this way. Totalizing, annihilating threats were for cranks, alarmists, extremists and speculating academics. Follow the path of existential danger, though, and you can track a slow shift in the tenor of our conversations. A few decades ago, we were still swaddled in a consensus that made us feel as if things were unlikely to change or end, even if we dearly wanted them to; the order of the world was too firm for that. Now we are more practiced than ever in spotting potential ends. We have made sport of it. We find wrenching, apocalyptic change lurking inside everything — enough to invoke just the kind of despair European intellectuals used to write plays about.', 'Soldier Dances, From a Land Pervaded by the Military - The New York TimesOne of the first things visitors to Israel notice is the soldiers. They’re everywhere. Some are on duty, but others are slouched over coffee at a cafe, napping on a bus or just glued to their phones like everyone else. It can seem a peculiarly casual presence, but the ubiquity reflects how the military pervades all aspects of Israeli life. Reflecting on his career, the choreographer and performer Yossi Berg realized that its presence had infiltrated his dance work, too.“I’m playing a soldier in quite a few pieces,” he remembers telling his romantic and artistic partner, Oded Graf.That realization, which he and Mr. Graf talked about in a recent Skype interview, was a catalyst for their new work “Come Jump With Me,” coming to New York Live Arts on Friday and Saturday. (It’s part of a series presented by the American Dance Festival, where it was performed this summer.) Also this week, a few blocks uptown at the Baryshnikov Arts Center, another Israeli choreographer, Roy Assaf, is presenting a program that includes “The Hill,” a male trio inspired by a popular Israeli song about a pivotal battle in the 1967 Six-Day War.The country’s politics — its chronic anxieties about conflict and war — have always been reflected in Israeli choreographers’ work. But it’s rare for war and the experience of soldiers to be such explicit reference points, as they are in these dances.Mr. Assaf, Mr. Berg and Mr. Graf are part of a recent wave of independent dance artists working outside of established troupes like the Batsheva Dance Company and the Kibbutz Contemporary Dance Company. And with more voices, Mr. Graf pointed out, come “more points of view.” Among these voices are several who are more willing to address their country’s complex politics in overt ways onstage.Of the works in New York this week, “Come Jump With Me” is the most direct in its dissection of, and ambivalence about, modern Israeli nationalism. “From the beginning, we knew we wanted it to be a love-hate poem to Israel,” Mr. Graf said. With spoken text, assorted props and extensive jump-roping, Mr. Berg and Olivia Court Mesa, a South American immigrant to Israel, investigate their complicated relationship with the country.The conversational and confessional work, in which Mr. Berg lists his theatrical portrayals of soldiers, is a departure from the type of abstract, highly physical work that has come to define much of contemporary Israeli dance. Jodee Nimerichter, the director of the American Dance Festival, said she was attracted to the work’s nuance and intimacy. “They’re not afraid to reveal themselves on so many levels,” she said.For his part, Mr. Assaf, 35, said he wasn’t initially interested in tackling politics or engaging in self-examination. He was just drawn to the urgent rhythm and mood of the military song, “Ammunition Hill” by Yoram Taharlev, which his choreography matches with quick gestures and combative partnering. “The tension was right,” he said of the music in a Skype interview from Israel.But as “The Hill” evolved, from a solo to a trio, he found that the lyrics and gender dynamics added unexpected layers. “Maybe I unconsciously wanted to deal with this subject,” he said. Referring to his all-male cast, he added, “I needed this unit, this brotherhood.” In the work, the men catch and console one another, and get tangled up in one another’s bodies — an illustration of both the vulnerability and camaraderie of being in the military.Military service is compulsory in Israel — three years for men, about two for women — and, like his peers, Mr. Assaf joined the army at 18, serving as a paratrooper and commander. Though he had very little dance training before joining, he said his dance skills proved useful. He approached military exercises like choreographic routines, and was praised by his superiors for his agility. “I was aware of my body and that I’m using it in the same ways I learned movement,” he said. After his discharge, eager to continue dancing, he joined Emanuel Gat’s company, with which he danced for six years.Mr. Graf, 38, didn’t have any dance to draw on when he served in the air force but found refuge in it afterward. The day he was discharged, he said, he left his base in the desert and entered an “inexperienced guy” dance class at the Kibbutz company’s school at Kibbutz Ga’aton in the verdant north of the country. “I really, really wanted to do something different from the military service,” he said. “Suddenly I’m in an atmosphere surrounded by art. It was magical.” Mr. Berg, 41, didn’t serve in the military, a decision he discusses in “Come Jump With Me.” When it was time to enlist, he had just been accepted to Batsheva, and military service would have forced him to leave the company, so he sought and received an exemption. (About a quarter of male prospects receive exemptions for a variety of reasons like religious observance or health.)His decision would not have been necessary had he been accepted into a program that the Israel Defense Forces, or I.D.F., began in the 1990s. It allows promising dancers, called “excellent dancers,” to continue their training while fulfilling their service, an option that was already available to musicians and athletes. The excellent dancers — there are currently 63 — are given administrative positions at bases near Tel Aviv, where the majority of dance schools and companies are, and have flexible hours for training and performances.But whether a dancer served in a combat unit, behind a desk, or not at all, the symbol of the soldier follows Israeli artists throughout their lives and can fight its way into their work, even if that wasn’t the intention. In Mr. Assaf’s work, the military feels like an elusive memory, while in Mr. Berg and Mr. Graf’s work, its continuing presence haunts them.“This obsession with being a soldier, the army mentality,” Mr. Graf said, “it’s about a mode that you are, and how you relate to your country.” Or, as Mr. Berg put it, it’s about “still not being able to escape the reality here.”', 'President Trump announced Wednesday the United States is formally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and is instructing the State Department to begin the process of moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.“I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,” Trump said in his speech.Like presidents before him, Trump expressed his support for Israel during his presidential campaign and said the embassy should be moved to “the eternal capital for the Jewish people, Jerusalem.”However, several Muslim groups and nations have expressed concern over the possible recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that moving the capital is a “red line” for Muslims and such an action would result in Turkey severing its diplomatic ties with Israel.The embassy move is expected to take a minimum of three or four years, U.S. officials said.Already under construction is a new U.S. "consulate annex" in Jerusalem, which is believed to be more secure than the current embassy in Tel Aviv. Although senior administration officials said there was no facility currently ready for personnel to move into.But in the meantime, Trump will reportedly sign, and will continue to sign, the 6-month waiver to the Jerusalem Embassy Act. Thatact essentially allows presidents to sign continuous waivers to stall the relocation of the embassy and will prevent significant cuts to State Department funding.Read on to find out why the decision is so contentious — and why it hasn’t been accomplished yet.Finding the capitalThe international community, and until recently including the U.S., largely does not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel as it is claimed by both Palestinians and Israelis. Like other countries, the U.S. keeps its embassy in Tel Aviv, approximately an hour away.The U.S. moving its embassy, it could cause “significant harm to the U.S. credibility as a mediator” for peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians, said Dylan Williams, vice president of government affairs for J Street, a left-leaning pro-Israel advocacy organization.Williams added that the move could “undermine confidence” from Palestinians and Arab countries that the U.S. would remain an impartial negotiator in efforts to create peace in the Middle East.“It shouldn’t be moved prior to agreement by the parties to the conflict as part of a comprehensive agreement ending their conflict,” Williams, J Street’s chief lobbyist, told Fox News.Williams added that such a move could also turn deadly.“Even seemingly minor changes of Jerusalem’s status quo — either in fact or in law — have historically had the impact of sparking violence,” Williams said.Support for JerusalemMillions of evangelical eyes were on Trump, waiting to see if he would keep his campaign promise to move the embassy, longtime Pastor John Hagee told Fox News ahead of the president\'s official announcement."I can assure you that 60 million evangelicals are watching this promise closely because if President Trump moves the embassy into Jerusalem, he will historically step into immortality," Hagee said. "He will be remembered for thousands of years for his act of courage to treat Israel like we already treat other nations.""If he does not, he will be remembered as just another president who made a promise he failed to keep which would generate massive disappointment in that strong evangelical base that went to vote for him against Hillary Clinton," he added.Hagee is the founder and senior pastor of Cornerstone Church, a megachurch in San Antonio, Texas. He founded the nonprofit Christians United for Israel in 2006 as well.Morton Klein, president of the nonprofit Zionist Organization of America, also hoped Trump would move the embassy soon and dismissed the idea that its relocation could negatively influence peace talks.“It should be moved because we have to once and for all end this propaganda myth that Jerusalem is holyfor Muslims,” Klein told Fox News.Klein said he has advised the Trump administration when it comes to Israeli affairs.United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley also expressed her support for a Jerusalem capital during an interview withCBNin May, pointing to other government operations that operate in the city.“Obviously, I believe that the capital should be Jerusalem and the embassy should be moved to Jerusalem because ... all their government is in Jerusalem,” Haley said. “So much of what goes on is in Jerusalem, and I think we have to see that for what it is.”AMarch 2016 Gallup pollfound that the majority of Americans didn’t express an opinion when asked if the U.S. embassy should move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But of those who did have an opinion, Americans were split with 24 percent supporting a move and 20 percent disagreeing with relocation.Congressional authorityTrump isn’t the only president to declare his intentions to move the U.S. embassy; both former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush also pledged to move the embassy — only to abandon the idea once in the White House.Congress approved in 1995 the funding and relocation of the embassy to Jerusalem by 1999. But the law included a stipulation, allowing for presidents to sign continuous waivers to stall the relocation of the embassy. Every president since has used the waiver in an effort to avoid conflict with the peace negotiations.Klein was “fully confident” that Trump would break that nearly 20-year tradition and keep his promise to move the embassy.But Williams had dismissed the campaign promise as just “pandering to a right-wing minority of the pro-Israel and Jewish communities that so far has yet to be acted upon because elected officials recognize the danger to Israel of following through on it.”Fox News\' John Roberts, Leland Vittert and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Kaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

In Amman, Jordan, demonstrators held large posters of President Trump bearing the words, “Go to hell.”In the West Bank, scores of protesters were said to have been wounded, many by rubber-tipped bullets.In Gaza, Palestinian health officials reported two deaths and scores of injuries from Israeli fire along the border.Throwing stones at Israeli forces across the Gaza border fence and masking his face with a Palestinian flag, Mohammed Kharoub, 26, said he was willing to spill his own blood. “I am here for Jerusalem,” he said.But the enormous wave of violence that had been feared after Mr. Trump’s decision to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel did not immediately materialize. Hamas, the Islamic militant group that dominates Gaza, had demanded a “day of rage” on Friday, calling on Palestinians to confront Israeli forces wherever they could, and for the start of a new intifada, or popular uprising.But in the holy city itself, the main Friday Prayer at Al Aqsa Mosque was held without incident, according to the Israeli police, and the crowds that gathered afterward dispersed largely peacefully. Three Palestinians were arrested at the Damascus Gate to the Old City in East Jerusalem after scuffling with the police, Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, said.Later, at least two rockets were fired out of Gaza. The Israeli military said one was intercepted and another fell in open ground. After retaliatory Israeli airstrikes against Hamas military targets in Gaza, another rocket struck a road in the Israeli border town of Sderot.But by nightfall, the protests had died down. Hamas called for protesters to return to the streets on Saturday.One possible reason for relative calm in the city at the center of the storm was that the Israeli police did not try to bar young Palestinian men from attending the noon prayer at Al Aqsa Mosque, which it had done during previous tense periods. Limiting entry to the Muslim holy site has inflamed passions in the past.And though Hamas called for an intifada, Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, has repeatedly stated that he does not want a third intifada to break out on his watch.Israel carried out more retaliatory strikes in Gaza early Saturday, targeting four Hamas sites, its military said. The strikes killed two people, the Palestinian health ministry said on Facebook.Analysts said the Palestinians may not be eager to embark on a new, sustained intifada because of fatigue, because of a sense that Mr. Trump’s decision probably cannot be reversed and because two previous uprisings did not bring them closer to the goal of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.“The business community is fatigued, exhausted and angry,” said Mahdi Abdul Hadi, director of PASSIA, an independent Palestinian research institute in East Jerusalem. “Institutions are fighting for survival. The youth is not organized, cannot see a plan, leadership or direction.”Resistance in the city is “spontaneous and individualistic,” he said.Many of East Jerusalem’s Palestinians in any case feel ambivalent toward the Palestinian Authority and are largely cut off by Israel’s separation barrier from the West Bank.Zakaria al-Qaq, a professor at Al Quds University in East Jerusalem, said the Palestinian Authority had long neglected Jerusalem and its Palestinian inhabitants, allocating a paltry part of its budget to them. With Mr. Trump’s decision, Mr. Qaq said, the authority was “paying a price” for its lack of strategy for the city.Hamas also noted that the Palestinians were marking the 30th anniversary this week of the start of the first intifada, an uprising against Israeli occupation that began in Gaza, quickly spread to the West Bank and led to hundreds of deaths, most of them of Palestinians.“Trump can never change the reality of history, geography and the identity of the holy city,” Ismail Haniya, the leader of Hamas, said on local television.Mr. Trump’s declaration on Wednesday was widely condemned internationally. At the United Nations, the United States faced strong criticism from friends and adversaries alike on Friday.Most of the world considers East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war, as occupied territory, its status to be resolved through peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.Despite the highly symbolic recognition, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Friday that it would probably take two years to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem because of the logistics involved.Mr. Trump’s declaration also garnered furious responses from leaders throughout the Arab and Muslim world.In Lebanon, thousands rallied in Beirut and residents of Palestinian refugee camps were bused in to join the protest. “I’ve only ever seen Jerusalem in pictures,” said Abdullah Mustafa, a teenager from a refugee family. “But it’s my life.”In Cairo, a preacher at Al Azhar Mosque, an ancient bastion of Sunni Muslim scholarship, railed against what he termed Mr. Trump’s “illegal” decision, which he compared to attacks on Christian churches by the Islamic State militant group. As prayers ended, congregants stood up chanting, “We sacrifice our souls and blood for you, Aqsa,” in reference to the Jerusalem mosque revered as the third-holiest site in Islam.Thousands demonstrated peacefully in Istanbul’s historic quarter with calls against America and Israel. Despite restrictions against gatherings and protests under the state of emergency that has been in force for 18 months, police who usually break up demonstrations with tear gas allowed this one to go ahead with speeches and music in the park.In Tehran, state-backed rallies were held after Friday Prayer. The hard-line imam Ahmad Khatami said during his sermon that “all the world is protesting Trump’s decision,” adding, “Some of the statesmen in America believe he has a mental problem and must receive treatment from doctors.”“We have missiles, we build missiles and will increase the range of our missiles to 1,000 or 1,500 kilometers to deprive White House residents from a comfortable sleep,” Mr. Khatami continued. “We will not seek an atomic bomb,” he added, but “if a crazy state named the Zionist regime makes any mistake we will raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground.”', 'Leland Vittert reports on precautions being taken.President Donald Trump early Friday tweeted a short montage of his three predecessors voicing support for Jerusalem to be recognized as Israel’s capital.The tweet carries the caption, “I fulfilled my campaign promise — others didn’t.”I fulfilled my campaign promise - others didn’t! pic.twitter.com/bYdaOHmPVJThe tweet follows intenseopposition to the move -- voiced by Arab, Muslim and European critics -- which would upend decades of U.S. policy and risk potentially violent protests.Trump has also promised to relocate the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.The tweet includes clips of former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama and indicates the year of each clip.Clinton is seen in 1992 saying, “Jerusalem is still the capital of Israel and must remain an undivided city accessible to all."Bush is seen in 2000. “As soon as I take office, I will move the United States ambassador to the city Israel has chosen as its capital," he says.Obama is seen in 2008 saying, “I continue to say that Jerusalem will be the capital of Israel. I have said that before and I will say it again.”The controversy surrounding the move of the embassy dates back decades. A law passed in 1995 under the Clinton administration considers Jerusalem the capital, and even mandates the move of the embassy there.But the law allows for a loophole used by former presidents -- an option to issue waivers every six months to delay the move from Tel Aviv.The U.S. would be the first country to move its embassy to Jerusalem, which is claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. Other countries who have diplomatic relations with Israel keep their embassies in Tel Aviv.Trump said he will instruct the State Department to begin the multi-year process of moving the U.S. Embassy to the holy city, U.S. officials said Tuesday. It remained unclear, however, when he might take that physical step, which is required by U.S. law but has been waived on national security grounds for more than two decades.Administration officials said Tuesday that Trump will still sign a waiver to keep from jeopardizing State Department funding while the relocation process begins.In January, Republican Sens. Dean Heller, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruzintroducedlegislation calling for the embassy to be moved to Jerusalem and recognizing the city as Israel\'s capital, after the Obama administration abstained from a U.N.

Mr. Mande and his audience were hurried upstairs, to the 800-seat sanctuary under an elaborate 69-foot Moorish-style dome, where hundreds of 20- and 30-something guests crammed into pews. Mr. Mande soon unleashed an expletive-laden set from the pulpit, delivering his usual jokes in front of a painted portion of scripture: “Remember Ye the Law of Moses.”“It was like an anxiety dream,” said Mr. Mande, who is Jewish. “I was imagining that the manager was going to be like, ‘You have to do your Torah portion.’ I couldn’t believe what was happening.”The setting might have been unlikely in most houses of worship, but not the Sixth and I Historic Synagogue — now a centerpiece of Jewish life in the capital, where bawdy comedy sets, high-profile music acts, podcast recordings, beer tastings and book talks mix with traditional spiritual programming: Simhat Torah celebrations, regular Sabbath observances, Purim theater and five varieties of High Holy Day services.While other Jewish organizations have tried a culture-centric model — the 92nd Street Y in New York is perhaps the best-known example — Sixth and I’s blend of the religious and the artistic has become a local template, a convergence of intellectual and spiritual currents that has helped shape the character of Judaism in Washington.At a time when young Jews see synagogue affiliations as less of a social obligation, Sixth and I’s nonmembership, ticketed model has given them a way to be spiritually self-structured, to come and go, to pay by the activity.Sixth and I’s High Holy Days services sell out to over 3,000 people, part of the 80,000 who visit every year — a staggering number for a small space that is just over a decade old. Sabbath services alone draw 10,000 guests each year. Around 680,000 people live in the District.“What it is today is really the story of the inordinate amount of change we’re seeing in American Jewish life,” said M. Bruce Lustig, the rabbi at one of the capital’s most storied synagogues, Washington Hebrew Congregation.The physical structure, too, has become an important expression of Washington’s complicated and shifting demography, changing from its century-old roots as a synagogue to a black church, almost becoming a nightclub, before being restored as a synagogue — the only one in the city’s center.Young Jews, Rabbi Lustig said, “want to walk to work, to where you buy food, where you pray, where you get intellectually stimulated.”The building, just blocks from a subway hub, is a kind of spiritual middle point in the city, easy to access by bike, train, car or foot.“We’re in the right place at the right time,” said Shelton Zuckerman, one of three Washington developers who bought the building to save it from what would have been a nightclub. Its seller, the Turner Memorial A.M.E. Church, was eager to help avoid that fate.“We decided what D.C. needed was a nondenominational synagogue,” Mr. Zuckerman said. “It wasn’t conservative; it wasn’t orthodox; it wasn’t reform.”Daniel G. Zemel, the rabbi at Temple Micah, which has long been viewed as at the forefront of progressive synagogues, called Sixth and I a new kind of hybrid.“American Jewish life,” he said, “is sorely in need of more alternative, open-ended and self-defining and evolving institutions.”Yet for all of its appeals to modern Jewish life, the Sixth and I Historic Synagogue is a logical consequence of a long and classical tradition in Washington.Several of the earliest Jewish groups here predated or then mimicked the “synagogue-center” model that Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, considered the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, is believed to have termed in the 20th century. Among the early examples was the Hebrew Home for the Aged, which by 1932 had 52 residents and a 300-capacity synagogue, and a Young People’s Synagogue in Washington, an organizing mechanism for young, unaffiliated Jews, which held High Holy Days services at the Sheraton Silver Spring Motor Inn in Maryland.The most successful early entrant was the Washington Jewish Community Center, which remains a presence less than a mile north of the White House.Mr. Zuckerman and his partners reopened the building in 2004 and rebranded it as the Sixth and I Historic Synagogue. Its early years were susceptible to criticism, especially from local rabbis at synagogues with long membership rolls.“I have more than once actually been named in a rabbi’s sermon in D.C., pointing out that this is not a way you build community,” said Esther Safran Foer, the director from 2007 to 2016. “They were afraid we were undermining the Jewish community.”The timing of Ms. Foer’s tenure dovetailed with a sharp influx of young professionals to the capital, and to a downtown at times known for its vacancies. Washington Jews have once again started to flock to the city’s center, after half that population had moved to the suburbs by 1956.Last year, the city hit its highest population mark in four decades, thanks to new residents in their 20s and 30s. (Those ages 20 to 34 made up almost all of the city’s  population gain from 2000 to 2010.)“We’ll have traditional services on Friday and then in the next room, 250 young Jewish professionals enjoying shabbat dinner,” said Heather Moran, Sixth and I’s executive director.As younger Jews have become less attached to religious conventions and institutions, Sixth and I has become more attentive to its participants’ social lives, offering meditation and paid family leave classes. About a third of Jews in the area do not identify with a particular branch of Judaism, like Orthodox or Reform, the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington found in a 2015 study.The senior rabbi at Sixth and I, Shira Stutman, estimates that a third of those at her services are not Jewish. She said that her intent was to “engage people who are marginally connected to Judaism, who have Jewish pride but whose first thought on a Friday night isn’t to go to services.”One of those non-Jews, Katharina Obser, said she started going to interfaith couples workshops and Sabbath services with her husband, who is Jewish, in 2015 and has not stopped.“Even if the specific liturgy isn’t my liturgy,” Ms. Obser, 33, said, “that space for reflection, that space for thoughtfulness is something that I value immensely and have not found in another religious setting.”Ms. Obser said that there was “a spirituality there that I can practice that has really resonated with me.”One subject Rabbi Stutman emphasizes to all of her congregants is the effect of gentrification in the neighborhoods surrounding Sixth and I, which have become destination addresses amid the city’s population boom.Washington is a study in the ways new communities interact with older ones, she said. The synagogue rents a Chinese church for services, joins with a black church for Martin Luther King’s Birthday services and hosts a young Muslims group, leaving her congregants more sensitive to the city’s fabric.The synagogue has also been adept with the currency of celebrity.Notable speakers include Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice; Senator Elizabeth Warren; the surgeon and journalist Atul Gawande; the chef Yotam Ottolenghi; the transgender activist Caitlyn Jenner; the actresses Tina Fey and Gabourey Sidibe; and the Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg.“Friends on boards of other synagogues have told me they’ve loosened it up because of Sixth and I’s influence,” Mr. Zuckerman said.Local celebrities have helped, too. Rabbi Shmuel Herzfeld of Ohev Sholom — The National Synagogue in Washington has been one of the most reliable advocates for Sixth and I, even adopting some of its freewheeling aesthetic charms, including one he invented: a car advertising his synagogue that he deemed the “Matzoh Mobile.”Sixth and I is “the vanguard and trendsetter” in Washington Jewish life, said Rabbi Herzfeld, whose synagogue’s members include several couples that met at Sixth and I.He offered a blessing, then ate one of the first potato chips at one of Sixth and I’s most eccentric creations, a kosher food truck called “6th & Rye,” with corned beef certified by a rabbi in Baltimore.Despite its reach, Sixth and I’s triumphs have not created friction with the leaders of other Jewish institutions. The Jewish Community Center’s director, Carole Zawatsky, is regular breakfast partners with Ms. Moran.“We complement each other and enhance each other,” Ms. Zawatsky said. “A robust Jewish community is now part of what D.C. is.”And Sixth and I’s pull is not limited to its neighbors.“The kinds of things that have been done at Sixth and I are a model for what can be done at a Jewish community center,” said Doron Krakow, the president and chief executive of the Jewish Community Center Association of North America, which is based in New York. Mr. Krakow says he thinks of Sixth and I as precisely what has made Jewish institutions more appealing to an urban-dwelling set: letting young Jews live and pray in the same small radius.“Jewish community centers have been born or reborn to respond to precisely that dynamic,” he said.Washington’s traditional synagogues have capitalized, too. A decade ago, Rabbi Lustig was worried about the resources his synagogue had to attract young Jews. Now, he said, “we’re busting at the seams,” with millenial-targeted events oversubscribed — another indication of the attendant riches of a wave of religious 20-somethings moving to the capital.Adas Israel, a synagogue that used to be housed in Sixth and I’s building, now counts many young Sixth and I participants among its members.Sixth and I is “blowing up Jewish ideas into new dimensions,” said Lauren Holtzblatt, a rabbi at Adas Israel. She recently ran the synagogue’s mindfulness center, which includes meditation, yoga and “soulful” Sabbath services.For the more established synagogues like hers, Rabbi Holtzblatt said, Sixth and I, only notionally a synagogue, can be instructive even for the most conventional places of worship.“They form intimate Jewish communities in a place that claims not to have a Jewish community,” she said.', 'Does President Trump Want Peace in the Middle East? - The New York TimesIn the debate over a potential Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, no issue is more charged with emotion than the future of Jerusalem. Should the holy city be the capital of the Israelis alone or shared with the Palestinians?Yet now, with no serious peace talks underway, President Trump is reportedly planning to grant the Israelis’ wish and confound the Palestinians by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the American Embassy there from Tel Aviv, thereby tossing aside decades of American diplomacy. Why?Mr. Trump insists he is committed to achieving the “ultimate” Middle East peace agreement that eluded his predecessors. But his decision to tip the scales toward Israel on this critical matter, communicated to Arab and Israeli leaders on Tuesday, almost certainly will make an agreement harder to reach by inflaming doubts about America’s honesty and fairness as a broker in negotiations, raising new tension in the region and perhaps inciting violence.Although Israel’s government has been located in Jerusalem since its founding in 1948, the United States, like most of the rest of the world, hasn’t recognized the city as Israeli territory, even after the Arab-Israeli War in 1967, when Israel drove back Jordan from East Jerusalem and occupied it. Under the Oslo Accords, Israel promised to negotiate Jerusalem’s future as part of a peace agreement. It has been assumed that under any deal, the city would remain its capital.Palestinians anticipated being able to locate their capital in East Jerusalem and to have access to Muslim holy sites there. East Jerusalem was exclusively Arab in 1967, but Israel has steadily built settlements there, placing some 200,000 of its citizens among the Arab population and complicating any possible peace agreement.Mr. Trump boasts of being a consummate dealmaker, but dealmakers don’t usually make concessions before negotiations begin, as the president has here. The big winner is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, whose hard-line government has shown no serious interest in peace, at least not a two-state solution that could win Palestinian support. The blowback was swift. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, warned of “dangerous consequences” to the peace process, while Jordan’s King Abdullah II, the royal palace said, cautioned against the move, “stressing that Jerusalem is the key to achieving peace and stability in the region and the world.” Turkey threatened to cut diplomatic ties with Israel; other criticism came from Egypt, the Arab League and France. King Salman of Saudi Arabia told Mr. Trump a decision on Jerusalem before a final peace deal would hurt talks and increase regional tensions.That Saudi warning might be expected, given that Jerusalem is home to the Aqsa Mosque and that the Saudi king holds the title of custodian of Islam’s two other holiest mosques, in Mecca and Medina. A Saudi-sponsored Arab peace initiative still on the table calls for a full Israeli withdrawal from East Jerusalem as part of a far-reaching deal. Yet the Saudis may well be edging away from that position. Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, has close ties to Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and Middle East adviser, who is drafting a comprehensive peace plan.While that plan is not yet public, Crown Prince Mohammed is said to have outlined a proposal to Mr. Abbas last month that favored the Israelis more than any proposal previously embraced by the American government. Palestinians would get limited sovereignty over a state that covers only noncontiguous parts of the West Bank. Most Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which most of the world considers illegal, would remain. The Palestinians would not get East Jerusalem as their capital, and there would be no right of return for Palestinian refugees and their descendants.No Palestinian leader could accept such a plan and retain popular support, and the White House and Saudis denied they are working on such ideas. But some analysts doubt Mr. Trump really wants a peace agreement and say any possible proposal may be intended as political cover so Israel and the Sunni Arabs, once enemies, can intensify their incipient collaboration against Iran.The constituency Mr. Trump is most clearly courting is his own political base of evangelicals and other pro-Israel hard-liners. His predecessors had also made pandering campaign promises in support of moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem. But once in office they chose not to prioritize their domestic politics over delicate peace diplomacy, and they put that promise on hold.Some optimists think that Mr. Trump could lessen the harm of a decision on Jerusalem by making clear he will not prejudge the future of East Jerusalem or other core questions like the borders of a Palestinian state. His track record so far gives little evidence that he has the temperament or skill to navigate such a nuanced position.', 'Griff Jenkins reports from Washington, D.C.President Trump on Wednesday will order the State Department to begin moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, senior administration officials said, a move that fulfills a campaign promise made to religious conservatives but one that could inflame tensions across the Middle East.In his announcement, Trump will say that the U.S. government recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. One official described it as an "honest" acknowledgement of a "seven-decade old fact."“While President Trump recognizes that the status of Jerusalem is a highly sensitive issue, he does not think it will be resolved by ignoring the simple truth that Jerusalem is home to Israel’s legislature, its Supreme Court, the prime minister and is such the capital of Israel,” one official said.The U.S. would be the first country to move its embassy to Jerusalem, which is claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. Other countries who have diplomatic relations with Israel keep their embassies in Tel Aviv.But the embassy move would not be immediate and could take at least three or four years.The U.S. officials said there are currently about 1,000 personnel in the embassy in Tel Aviv. They added that there is no facility in Jerusalem ready to serve as the embassy site, and it will take time to address security, design and cost concerns."It will take some time to find a site, address security concerns, design a new facility, fund a new facility -- working with Congress, obviously -- and build it," one official said. "So this is not an instantaneous process."Ahead of the announcement, Trump spoke Tuesday with Palestinian President Mahmood Abbas, Jordanian King Abdullah and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Netanyahu has said he supports the U.S. moving its embassy. But Abbas has warned of the “gravity of consequences” should the move become official for “the peace process and security and stability in the region and world.”WHY TRUMP’S PROMISE TO MOVE US EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM IS SO CONTROVERSIALAn international affairs adviser for Abbas said that the move “totally destroys any chance that he can play a role as an honest broker” in Middle East peace negotiations.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that moving the capital was a “red line” for Muslims, and such an action could result in Turkey severing diplomatic ties with Israel.The controversy surrounding the move of the embassy dates back decades. A law passed in 1995 under the Clinton administration considers Jerusalem the capital, and even mandates the move of the embassy there.But the law allows for a loophole used by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama – an option to issue waivers every six months to delay the move from Tel Aviv.Trump also took advantage of the loophole, which Republicans have long called to be closed. Trump’s first waiver was signed in June, which drew praise from the Palestinians and some disappointment from Israel.The administration officials said Tuesday that Trump will still sign a waiver to keep from jeopardizing State Department funding while the relocation process begins.In January, Republican Sens. Dean Heller, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz introduced legislation that would move the embassy to Jerusalem and recognize the city as Israel\'s capital, after the Obama administration abstained from a U.N. Security Council vote to condemn Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank.Fox News\' Brooke Singman and Kelly Chernenkoff contributed to this report, along with The Associated Press.Alex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

It will cause irreparable harm to Mr. Trump’s own plans to make peace in the Middle East, and to any future administration’s efforts, as well. It will also undermine the United States’ own national security. The president should reconsider this decision immediately.Since Israel was established in 1948, the United Nations and the United States, like most countries, have refused to recognize any country’s sovereignty over Jerusalem, a city holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians.For this reason, the United States has always maintained its embassy to Israel in Tel Aviv. Since Israel militarily occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, the United States and the international community have rejected as illegal Israel’s attempts to cement its control over the city by expanding its boundaries, annexing it and constructing a ring of settlements on occupied Palestinian land around its outskirts to sever it from the rest of the West Bank.With his announcement on Wednesday, Mr. Trump has legitimized Israel’s illegal actions and sent the message that the United States no longer has any regard for international conventions or norms, and that might and power prevail over justice and the law.Perhaps this shouldn’t have been a surprise. Members of Israel’s hard-right government were overjoyed at Mr. Trump’s election, believing they would have a free rein to accelerate the expansion of settlements. The president’s selection of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to lead his administration’s Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts and the appointment of David Friedman as ambassador to Israel, both of whom have ties to Israel’s settlement movement, further emboldened the settlers and their supporters in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. Indeed, Israel has expanded its settlements over the past year.By rewarding its claim on Jerusalem with official recognition, Mr. Trump is giving Israel a free hand to accelerate its policies of creeping annexation of the occupied Palestinian territories and its deliberate attempts to erase the Palestinians’ historical, political, cultural and demographic presence in historic Palestine.This will encourage Israeli officials to further intensify their violations of Palestinian rights in the city; more Palestinian homes will be destroyed and more Palestinian families made homeless. (Since Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967, Israeli authorities have, according to the United Nations, destroyed some 20,000 Palestinian homes in the city.) It will also mean more Palestinian land stolen for settlements and more Palestinian Jerusalemites will have their right to reside in the city where they were born and raised and where their families still live revoked by Israel, as it has done to more than 14,000 Palestinians since 1967, according to human rights groups. And it will fuel further calls from right-wing Israelis, including members of Mr. Netanyahu’s government, to annex parts or all of the West Bank: After all, if the United States has given its stamp of approval to the annexation of Jerusalem, why shouldn’t right-wing Israelis believe it will one day do the same with more territory?Moreover, the United States’ recognition of Jerusalem as part of Israel could embolden messianic Jewish extremists — some of whom are supported by Israeli government officials — who want to build a Jewish temple in the Noble Sanctuary mosque complex in the Old City of East Jerusalem, one of the most sensitive religious sites in the world. This could easily ignite a major religious conflagration in the Middle East and beyond with an outcome that cannot be predicted.Wednesday’s announcement may finally put to rest the dream of a two-state solution, which has been on life support for years already — after more than 25 years as the United States government’s official goal. For if all of Jerusalem is part of Israel, then East Jerusalem cannot be the capital of a Palestinian state, rendering the idea of two states living side by side in peace obsolete.If that is not enough to persuade Mr. Trump to change his mind, he should listen to the advice of his own secretary of defense, James Mattis. In 2013, when he was the head of the United States Central Command, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East, Mr. Mattis said that he “paid a military security price every day” because the United States was “seen as biased in support of Israel.” American recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital exacerbates this problem exponentially.It is our hope as Palestinians that saner voices will prevail and that the United States will refrain from any actions that will further destabilize the Middle East. If Mr. Trump truly wishes to have a chance at making peace, he must reverse his decision on Jerusalem immediately.', 'A Palestinian man shot three Israeli security officers dead and critically wounded a fourth; Conor Powell reports from JerusalemA lone wolf Palestinian terrorist gunned down three Israeli security officers Tuesday at the entrance to a settlement outside Jerusalem, Israeli officials said, evoking a harsh response from one lawmaker, who called the gunman “Satan” and said his body should be thrown into the sea.Gaza\'s Hamas ruling party praised the attack but stopped short of taking responsibility for it. Israeli officials said the attacker --identified as Nimr Mahmoud Ahmed Jamal from Beit Surik -- was a 37-year-old Palestinian father of four who appeared to have acted alone and was suffering from personal issues, The Associated Press reported.Likud lawmaker Nava Boker called Jamal “Satan,"the Jerusalem Post reported.This morning, after a terrorist killed 3 Israelis & wounded 1, Gazans handed out sweets to celebrate the attack. pic.twitter.com/BEHmM1JAnMThe attack comes at a tense period amid the Jewish high holidays and is likely to complicate the mediation efforts of U.S. peace envoy Jason Greenblatt, who had just arrived in the region for meetings with Israeli and Palestinians leaders.Speaking at his weekly Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack was partially a result of systematic Palestinian incitement and said he expected Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to "condemn this attack and not try to justify it."Internal Security Minister Gilad Erdan told the Jerusalem Post that there were no prior indications that Jamal was planning to launch an attack. Israel\'s internal Shin Bet security service said its preliminary investigation indicated there was significant violence in Jamal’s family, while his wife had recently fled to Jordan and left him with their four children.Jamal said in a private message to his wife that she was a "merciful mother," apologized for the way he treated her and said he was in a "bad state of health," the IDF revealed, according to The Times of Israel.Netanyahu pledged that as a punitive measure, Jamal’s home would be demolished and working permits of his extended family would be revoked.Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said the attacker approached the back gate entrance of the Har Adar settlement Tuesday, hiding among dozens of Palestinian day laborers who were being checked by security forces.This morning, a Palestinian terrorist murdered 3 Israelis in a shooting attack near Jerusalem. May their memory be a blessing. pic.twitter.com/4JeDqE0wqtJamal aroused police suspicions and was asked to stop, Samri said. At that point, he pulled out a weapon and began opening fire from a short distance. The attacker, who held a valid permit to work in Israel, was then shot dead by other forces at the scene.The Magen David Adom medical service said that in addition to the three killed, a fourth Israeli man, 32, was evacuated to a hospital in critical condition. The casualties were identified as Solomon Gavria, a 20-year-old policeman, and two private security guards.Har Adar is an upscale community west of Jerusalem, straddling the seam line between the West Bank and Israel proper — and an unusual target in the wave of violence that Israel has been coping with during the past two years.The Associated Press contributed to this report.The IDF released a private message that he had sent to his wife, calling her a “merciful mother” and apologizing for the way he treated her. He told her he was “in a bad state of health” and that what he planned to do was not due to her.The IDF released a private message that he had sent to his wife, calling her a “merciful mother” and apologizing for the way he treated her.

Even those who agreed that Mr. Trump was recognizing the reality on the ground disagreed with his approach — making a major diplomatic concession without any evident gain in return.One of the exceptions was Ogden R. Reid, a former congressman who was the ambassador from 1959 to 1961, at the end of the Eisenhower administration. “I think it’s the right decision,” he said. “Not a lot more to say.”The other exception was Edward S. Walker Jr., who was ambassador from 1997 to 1999, under President Bill Clinton. “I think it’s about time,” he said. “We’ve been remiss in not recognizing realities as they are. We all know Israel has a capital, it’s called Jerusalem, and over my 35 years of service in the Middle East no one ever questioned that.”What about the departure from United States policy since 1948 — that the final status of Jerusalem is a matter for negotiation between the Israelis and Palestinians — and the condemnation from the international community?“It’s really a question of what are the lines, the borders, to be drawn around the state of Israel and the ultimate state of Palestine,” Mr. Walker said. “Nothing in what the president has said precludes the negotiation of a settlement of this issue.”That was not the prevailing view. More typical was the perspective of Daniel C. Kurtzer, who was the ambassador from 2001 to 2005, under President George W. Bush.“There are many downsides, both diplomatically and in terms of the Middle East peace process, and no upside,” Mr. Kurtzer said. “We are isolated internationally once again — except for the Israeli government, which supports this — and we are taking ourselves out of the role the president says he wants to play as a peace broker.”What of the argument that the peace process, with the goal of a two-state political solution, was dormant, and needed to be shaken up?“The fact that the process is moribund calls for a much more dramatic role,” he said. “It doesn’t call for the U.S. to lean over and adopt the position of one party and offer nothing to the other party.”Richard H. Jones, who was ambassador from 2005 to 2009, also under Mr. Bush, warned that groups like Hamas and the Islamic State would exploit the issue to incite violence, and predicted that the Palestinian Authority would step up international efforts to boycott and condemn Israel.“This is a risky move, which no doubt will cost lives in Israel and the region, particularly as Israeli settlers use it to justify accelerating their activity further,” he said in an email.Several of the ambassadors were open to recognizing West Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. But they said that should happen as part of a broader strategy that would also require the Israelis to halt or slow settlement construction and that would recognize East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.Martin S. Indyk, who served as ambassador twice, both times during Bill Clinton’s presidency, proposed just such a deal in an Op-Ed essay in The New York Times this year, weeks before Mr. Trump was sworn in.“Not surprisingly, President Trump didn’t follow my advice to couple his move on Jerusalem with a diplomatic initiative,” Mr. Indyk said on Thursday. “Instead, he tried to limit the damage by avoiding any geographic definition of the capital that he is officially recognizing. Unfortunately, that nuance will be lost on all sides.”William Andreas Brown, who was the ambassador from 1988 to 1992, and returned to the United States Embassy in Israel as chief of mission early in the Clinton administration, recalled that he once wrote a memo to the first President George Bush urging that the embassy be moved to Jerusalem.“My motivation was to incentivize Israel’s participation in the Madrid peace talks,” he said, referring to negotiations in 1991 that helped give momentum to what later became the Oslo process. He recalled that there was significant resistance to the proposal in the Bush administration, and that the idea was dropped.“If he was going to make this announcement, it ought to be very, very carefully crafted so as to minimize a blowup,” he said, making clear he did not think Mr. Trump had succeeded.William Caldwell Harrop, who was the ambassador from 1992 to 1993, called Mr. Trump’s decision “slightly reckless” and even “kind of a masochistic move” that might “undermine his own, repeatedly discussed, ‘great deal’ of bringing peace to the Israelis and Palestinians.”Having decided to make his announcement, Mr. Trump could have been explicit that he would place the embassy in West Jerusalem, Mr. Harrop said.“One has to be pessimistic,” he said after listening to Mr. Trump’s speech. “We’ll get, before long, more efforts by Palestinians to build up international recognition of the state of Palestine. Some form of intifada is very likely, and there will be more bloodshed.”Edward P. Djerejian, who was the ambassador from 1993 to 1994, in the optimistic aftermath of the Oslo peace accords, also found Mr. Trump’s effort to thread the needle unsatisfying.Mr. Trump portrayed his decision more as a recognition of on-the-ground reality than as a sharp change in policy, insisting that “the specific boundaries” of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem had yet to be settled.But Mr. Djerejian, who was a White House spokesman during the Reagan presidency, said there was “an inherent contradiction” in recognizing Jerusalem without saying what, exactly, comprises Jerusalem. “The timing and substance of this new position serves to confuse rather than clarify,” he said.James B. Cunningham, who was ambassador under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, called Mr. Trump’s decision “a pretty serious mistake,” and said that moving the embassy would have made sense only as “part of a strategy, not simply to demonstrate that you’re trying to do something different.”He added, “It doesn’t make Israel safer, the United States safer, or the region more stable.”The most recent former ambassador, Daniel B. Shapiro, who served under Mr. Obama, was sympathetic to Mr. Trump’s goal, if not the execution.“Jerusalem is Israel’s capital, and it’s appropriate that we recognize it as such,” he said in a phone interview. “In that sense, the president’s recognition of reality is fine.”He continued: “The missed opportunity here, though, is the failure to frame this decision in the context of achieving our broader strategic objective, which is a two-state solution. That would have required better prior consultation with Arab states. That would have required more clarity for what the Palestinians could expect as part of their aspirations for Jerusalem.”He said the decision might undermine the peace process that Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and special representative, Jason Greenblatt, have been working on.Most of the former ambassadors were reluctant to ascribe motivations to Mr. Trump, though several said the move would bolster his support among hard-line supporters of Israel in the United States and among some evangelical Christians.However, Thomas R. Pickering, who was ambassador to Israel during the Reagan administration, called it “a serious foreign policy mistake” and an attempt either at “ego satisfaction” or an effort to divert attention from a special counsel’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties with Russia.In an interview, Mr. Pickering compared Mr. Trump’s move to the film “Wag the Dog,” in which a president fabricates a war to distract attention from a sex scandal.', '', 'JERUSALEM – Breaking with decades of U.S. policy, President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital this week, a declaration that set off a wave of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces and drew sharp criticism from U.S. allies in the Middle East and beyond.Here\'s a look at why the U.S. recognition of the holy city as Israel\'s capital matters.___JERUSALEM\'S CURRENT STATUSIsrael has considered Jerusalem its capital since the state\'s establishment in 1948 and sees the city as the ancient capital of the Jewish people.In the 1967 Mideast war, Israel captured the city\'s eastern sector and later annexed it in a move that is not recognized internationally. Israel\'s government ministries and institutions are all located in Jerusalem and Israelis across the political spectrum see the city as their capital.Israel is likely the only country in the world whose capital isn\'t recognized internationally.The Palestinians equally lay claim to Jerusalem and want the eastern part of the city as capital of their future state. Some 200,000 Palestinians live in that part of the city and Palestinians claim a deep cultural, historical and religious connection to the city.The Old City, located in east Jerusalem, is home to sites holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims. These include the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews can pray, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam\'s third holiest site.It is one of the most explosive issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and to that end, the United States, along with most other countries, has maintained its embassy in Tel Aviv, saying the status of Jerusalem should be resolved between the sides in negotiations.___THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUMP\'S DECLARATIONThe U.S. remains the world\'s most influential superpower and a key player across the region. For the past quarter of a century, it has played a special role as the lead mediator between Israel and the Palestinians in on-again, off-again peace talks.Although it cannot singlehandedly dictate a solution to the Jerusalem dispute, its opinions carry great weight with both parties and traditionally influence others to follow its lead.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been one of Trump\'s most vocal supporters globally and has been outspoken about his gratitude for Trump\'s declaration on Jerusalem. But the Palestinians, and much of the international community, view the declaration as a unilateral action that could dash hopes for a negotiated two-state solution.___WANING AMERICAN INFLUENCEAs with other issues such as climate change and global free trade agreements, Trump finds himself at odds with the international community.American friends and foes alike have almost universally criticized Trump\'s decision with exceptionally harsh language. The European Union, along with Germany, Britain and France, as well as the pope and key Arab allies, have denounced the move.While the U.S. remains a power in the region, its influence in the Middle East has been on the decline. Some saw U.S. weakness in the Obama administration\'s handling of the war in Syria and its concessions to Iran for the 2015 nuclear deal. Trump\'s insistence on putting "America first" seems to presage a further drawdown.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has vowed to rally the world against the U.S. decision, reaching out to traditional Arab allies as well as Europeans nations. As a first step, the Palestinians asked the U.N. Security Council to demand that the U.S. decision be rescinded.___ANGER AND WEARINESSTrump\'s announcement has elicited shock, sadness and anger from Arabs across the Middle East. But there have also been feelings of resignation and shrugs from many who have long given up on their leaders standing up to either Israel or the United States.The Palestinians have been worn down by decades of conflict and years of stalled peace efforts, as their cause has been overshadowed by the fighting in Syria and Iraq, and regional concerns about Iran. Many of their Sunni Arab allies are believed to have expanded covert ties with Israel to counter Tehran.Randa Slim, an analyst with the Washington-based Middle East Institute, tweeted on Wednesday: "In times of fear and repression and revolution fatigue I will not be surprised if we don\'t see the kind of demonstrations people expect. This does not mean people are not angry. How people express their anger is different than in past."Israel and the U.S. may be counting on this crisis to pass, allowing Trump to renew his efforts to clinch what he calls "the ultimate deal," while leaving Israel firmly in control of the holy city.', '                                    Activist Linda Sarsour takes part in a demonstration outside Trump Tower in New York City, June 1, 2017.

Multiple people and organizations called out the university for inviting speakers with links to anti-Semitic radicals.“Having Linda Sarsour & head of (Jewish Voice for Peace) leading a panel on #antisemitism is like Oscar Meyer leading a panel on vegetarianism,” Jonathan Greenblatt, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, tweeted prior the event. “These panelists know the issue -- but unfortunately from perspective of fomenting it rather than fighting it.”The Jerusalem Post Editorial Board branded the event “a forum of ‘anti-Semites on antisemitism’” that “makes as much sense as a KKK forum on civil rights.” The New York Post, meanwhile, said event was “Orwellian.”Speaking on Tuesday night, Sarsour did little to defuse the perceptions about her and other speakers on the panel. Instead she said she was “unapologetically Palestinian-American” and “a very strong staunch supporter of boycott, divest, sanctions movement” against Israel, a movement that singles out the Jewish state and tries to isolate it economically and culturally.During the speech -- which barely touched the issue of anti-Semitism and how to tackle it -- Sarsour concluded that the greatest threat to America\'s Jewish community was the Trump administration.“The existential threat (to the Jewish community) resides in the White House, in the highest offices of these lands,” Sarsour told the audience."The existential threat (to the Jewish community) resides in the White House."“We are now living under fascism,” she later added, “and we need all hands on deck.”The activist also dismissed accusations of anti-Semitism against her and Louis Farrakhan, a notorious anti-Semite.“If what you\'re reading all day long, morning and night, in the Jewish media is that Linda Sarsour and Minister Farrakhan are the existential threats to the Jewish community, something really bad is gonna happen and we gonna miss the mark on it,” she said.Farrakhan, according to the New York Times, once warned Jews that they should not forget that “When it’s God who puts you in the ovens, it’s forever!” and praised Hitler as “a very great man” on national television.Lukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

The structure dates back to the Hellenistic period, when Greek influences were strong in the region.An altar adorned with the image of a bull was found inside the structure at Horvat ‘Amuda, in the Lachish region of Israel. The Idumeans were a Semitic people originating in southern Jordan who settled in the Judean foothills.RARE FIND AT KING SOLOMON'S MINES: ANCIENT PREGNANT WOMAN'S REMAINSArchaeologists believe that the altar may have been dismantled during the area’s conquest by the Hasmonean dynasty during the second century B.C.Remains of the structure indicate that it was intentionally dismantled, possibly by the Hasmoneans.(Photo: Dane Christensen)“If this was indeed an Idumean palace or temple, it is a rare and exciting find – similar structures in this country can be counted on the fingers of one hand,” explained excavation directors Dr. Oren Gutfeld of the Hebrew University, and Pablo Betzer and Michal Haber of the Israel Antiquities Authority, in a statement.A camera-equipped drone helped locate the structure. “This technology helped us choose where to focus our excavation probes, and, indeed, it very quickly emerged that this was in fact a unique discovery,” the archaeologists said.AMAZING WESTERN WALL DISCOVERY: NEW SECTION, ANCIENT THEATER, UNCOVERED IN JERUSALEMThe archaeologists found two stone incense altars in one of the rooms within the structure. One of them, which bears the carved image of a bull, stands in what appears to be the façade of a temple adorned with magnificent columns. Describing the decorated altar as a rare find, experts think that the bull may represent a deity worshipped by the Idumeans.Two cultic incense altars found in one of the rooms of the structure.(Photo: Michal Haber, Israel Antiquities Authority)Pottery vessels were also found, as well painted bowls, juglets and oil lamps, according to the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Additionally, a number of underground spaces were found at the site, which were used as quarries or to house ritual baths, oil presses and dovecots. Hiding tunnels from the time of the Jewish revolt against the Romans were also found, one of which contained a cooking pot from the time of the Bar Kokhba revolt in the second century.Students from Bar-Ilan University and volunteers from the U.S. participated in the excavation, which will continue in the spring.NEW EVIDENCE DATES CHRIST’S TOMB TO ROMAN ERA, MATCHING HISTORICAL RECORDSExperts are increasingly using technology to uncover ancient sites.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that moving the capital is a “red line” for Muslims and such an action would result in Turkey severing its diplomatic ties with Israel.The embassy move is expected to take a minimum of three or four years, U.S. officials said.Already under construction is a new U.S. "consulate annex" in Jerusalem, which is believed to be more secure than the current embassy in Tel Aviv. Although senior administration officials said there was no facility currently ready for personnel to move into.But in the meantime, Trump will reportedly sign, and will continue to sign, the 6-month waiver to the Jerusalem Embassy Act. Thatact essentially allows presidents to sign continuous waivers to stall the relocation of the embassy and will prevent significant cuts to State Department funding.Read on to find out why the decision is so contentious — and why it hasn’t been accomplished yet.Finding the capitalThe international community, and until recently including the U.S., largely does not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel as it is claimed by both Palestinians and Israelis. Like other countries, the U.S. keeps its embassy in Tel Aviv, approximately an hour away.The U.S. moving its embassy, it could cause “significant harm to the U.S. credibility as a mediator” for peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians, said Dylan Williams, vice president of government affairs for J Street, a left-leaning pro-Israel advocacy organization.Williams added that the move could “undermine confidence” from Palestinians and Arab countries that the U.S. would remain an impartial negotiator in efforts to create peace in the Middle East.“It shouldn’t be moved prior to agreement by the parties to the conflict as part of a comprehensive agreement ending their conflict,” Williams, J Street’s chief lobbyist, told Fox News.Williams added that such a move could also turn deadly.“Even seemingly minor changes of Jerusalem’s status quo — either in fact or in law — have historically had the impact of sparking violence,” Williams said.Support for JerusalemMillions of evangelical eyes were on Trump, waiting to see if he would keep his campaign promise to move the embassy, longtime Pastor John Hagee told Fox News ahead of the president\'s official announcement."I can assure you that 60 million evangelicals are watching this promise closely because if President Trump moves the embassy into Jerusalem, he will historically step into immortality," Hagee said. "He will be remembered for thousands of years for his act of courage to treat Israel like we already treat other nations.""If he does not, he will be remembered as just another president who made a promise he failed to keep which would generate massive disappointment in that strong evangelical base that went to vote for him against Hillary Clinton," he added.Hagee is the founder and senior pastor of Cornerstone Church, a megachurch in San Antonio, Texas. He founded the nonprofit Christians United for Israel in 2006 as well.Morton Klein, president of the nonprofit Zionist Organization of America, also hoped Trump would move the embassy soon and dismissed the idea that its relocation could negatively influence peace talks.“It should be moved because we have to once and for all end this propaganda myth that Jerusalem is holyfor Muslims,” Klein told Fox News.Klein said he has advised the Trump administration when it comes to Israeli affairs.United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley also expressed her support for a Jerusalem capital during an interview withCBNin May, pointing to other government operations that operate in the city.“Obviously, I believe that the capital should be Jerusalem and the embassy should be moved to Jerusalem because ... all their government is in Jerusalem,” Haley said. “So much of what goes on is in Jerusalem, and I think we have to see that for what it is.”AMarch 2016 Gallup pollfound that the majority of Americans didn’t express an opinion when asked if the U.S. embassy should move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But of those who did have an opinion, Americans were split with 24 percent supporting a move and 20 percent disagreeing with relocation.Congressional authorityTrump isn’t the only president to declare his intentions to move the U.S. embassy; both former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush also pledged to move the embassy — only to abandon the idea once in the White House.Congress approved in 1995 the funding and relocation of the embassy to Jerusalem by 1999. But the law included a stipulation, allowing for presidents to sign continuous waivers to stall the relocation of the embassy. Every president since has used the waiver in an effort to avoid conflict with the peace negotiations.Klein was “fully confident” that Trump would break that nearly 20-year tradition and keep his promise to move the embassy.But Williams had dismissed the campaign promise as just “pandering to a right-wing minority of the pro-Israel and Jewish communities that so far has yet to be acted upon because elected officials recognize the danger to Israel of following through on it.”Fox News\' John Roberts, Leland Vittert and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Kaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News. Follow her on Twitter @K_Schallhorn.', 'Born in Auschwitz, Israeli Artist, 102, Harnesses the Dark and the Light - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — She painted gray and black flowers, their innate beauty discernible only through hints of light.Her Israeli landscapes are stark and desolate, punctuated by towering cypress trees and heavy rocks. Minimalist still lifes depict a pair of empty chairs. In portraits, family members appear with blurred and vanishing features or faces that fade into geometric patterns because, the artist said, “they are all gone,” murdered in the Holocaust.The artist, Tova Berlinski, was born in 1915 in the Polish town of Oswiecim, better known by its German name — Auschwitz. Newly married, she and her husband left for what was then known as Palestine in 1938, a year before the Germans conquered Oswiecim and began building the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp on the edge of town.Much of her work evokes the loss and pain of a lifetime that spans a century — including the Nazi decimation of European Jewry in World War II and the foundation of modern Israel, which she came to help build and where she made her home.Yet there are also flashes of brightness and color, like an abstract painting from an early period recalling a candy and ice cream store named Posner from her youth in Oswiecim. More recent paintings, including one dated April 2017, around her 102nd birthday, depict bright, vibrant vistas — blue skies, green grass, balcony doors opening onto a rolling desert bathed in the Mediterranean sunlight.“The color returned to me,” Ms. Berlinski said. “Not to my life, but to me. I don’t know why.”It has been more than 20 years since her solo “Black Flowers” exhibition was held at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, one of the peaks of a long career. But this month, Ms. Berlinski, now a widow, is emerging once again into the limelight, with a tribute exhibition and sale of her works at ArtSpace, a small gallery in the leafy neighborhood of German Colony in Jerusalem, where she has lived for more than 50 years.Ms. Berlinski’s 11th-floor apartment, a short walk from the gallery, is ordinarily a quiet place, its walls lined with portraits of her vanished family and her late husband, Eliyahu Berlinski, known as Elec. But one recent weekday, it was abuzz.Linda Zisquit, an American-born poet and the director of ArtSpace, which represents contemporary Israeli artists, was visiting to choose some pieces with the help of Orna Millo, another Israeli artist, who curated Ms. Berlinski’s last solo exhibition, in 2002, at Jerusalem Artists House.Ms. Berlinski’s caretaker, Jenny Borjas, rushed around, helping to arrange the furniture for a photo shoot. (Ms. Borjas may also have had something to do with Ms. Berlinski’s more colorful work of late. She said she had encouraged Ms. Berlinski to return to using reds and a more cheerful palette.)In the catalog for the 2002 exhibition, Ms. Millo wrote, “Tova Berlinski’s paintings are very personal, in the style ‘I only knew how to tell my own story. My world is as narrow as an ant’s world.’ But through her prism, we can feel also the Israeli experience, and the difficulties of our existence in this country.”Describing what she called “My Pictorial Biography,” Ms. Berlinski wrote in the catalog: “Every portrait in the painting of my family tells a different story, but all are close to my heart with a love that time will not eradicate.”Those haunting portraits — of her father, her mother, her brother — hang on the walls of her salon, resonating with memories.Born Gusta Wolf to a Hasidic family, Ms. Berlinski has fond memories of growing up in Oswiecim, where about half the 12,000 residents were Jewish.“I very much loved that town,” she said.She met Elec, from nearby Sosnowiec, where her father had a furniture store, through their activities in Beitar, the right-wing Zionist youth movement. Ten days after marrying, they set off for what was then the British Mandate of Palestine, to join the pioneers working to establish Israel.They arrived on a ship of unauthorized immigrants, landing clandestinely, at night, south of Haifa, to evade the British authorities, who had imposed restrictions on Jewish immigration.For a while, she said, she kept contact with her family until it was no longer possible to get letters to them. According to Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial, the Jews of Oswiecim, whose property had been confiscated, were rounded up in 1941 and deported to ghettos, including to Sosnowiec, before being sent to the death camps. The town’s once-thriving Jewish community ceased to exist.Ms. Berlinski was the oldest of six children. Her parents and four siblings were killed — most of them, she said, in Auschwitz. One sister survived, then moved to Germany and, eventually, to Israel. She is the one who lived to tell Ms. Berlinski that the rest of the family had perished.“I felt great pain,” Ms. Berlinski said. “That pain I feel to this day.”Life in the British Mandate of Palestine, carved out of the former Ottoman Empire, was hard at first. The young couple, who remained childless, lived in the mobilized units formed by Beitar. Ms. Berlinski worked in the kitchens and orchards. Elec spent a few months in a British prison camp and fought in the Negev during the 1948 war over the creation of the Israeli state.Having left Beitar, which they found too militaristic, the couple moved to Tel Aviv. Ms. Berlinski took up acting for a while at the Cameri Theater. Mr. Berlinski had begun working for the government, and around 1950, they moved to Jerusalem. Ms. Berlinski began studying at one of the young state’s oldest institutions, the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design.In the 1970s, she joined the Climate group of Israeli artists, which promoted the idea of local Israeli painting as a rejection of imported art movements, but she soon broke with them, and the group was dismantled. Ms. Berlinski moved to the left politically and became active in Peace Now, an Israeli group that advocates ending the occupation, and a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Ultimately, Ms. Berlinski’s life, and the tribute exhibition of her work, is a celebration of endurance and survival. But she has not shut out Poland or Oswiecim; she has been back several times. In Oswiecim, she has visited the children of a woman who had been her mother’s close friend.She remembered her mother’s garden being full of flowers. The black flowers, she said, were for her parents, since there were no graves to visit, nothing left. She donated a painting of a black flower to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum during a visit to the former concentration camp in 2006.On the wall of her living room, among portraits, is a framed letter in Polish. It was signed by the mayor of Oswiecim, congratulating her on reaching the age of 100.“On this extraordinary day, I extend to you greetings from the heart, from the city of your birth, Oswiecim.”', '7 New Books We Recommend This Week - The New York TimesPolitics plays the leading role in this week’s list of recommendations, starting with Joe Biden’s memoir about his son Beau’s death from brain cancer in 2015 — a revealing look at fulfilling the duties of the vice presidency while caring for, and then mourning, a child. Two new biographies re-evaluate major political figures: “Lioness” examines the life of Golda Meir and her role in Zionism and Israel; and “President McKinley” brings an often overlooked president out of the shadows. For those more in the mood for fictitious escapes, an Icelandic mystery or a humorous collection of short stories might do the trick.John WilliamsDaily Books Editor and Staff WriterPROMISE ME, DAD: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose, by Joe Biden. (Flatiron Books, $27.) Biden’s oldest son, Beau, learned he had brain cancer in 2013, and died of the disease two years later, at 46. Biden’s memoir give us a remarkable view of the agony and strangeness of the period when he cared for his son — and then mourned him — while simultaneously fulfilling his duties as vice president. “The book is a backstage drama, honest, raw and rich in detail,” our critic Jennifer Senior writes. “People who have lost someone will genuinely take comfort from what he has to say.”LIONESS: Golda Meir and the Nation of Israel, by Francine Klagsbrun. (Schocken, $40.) Meir has often been as reviled in Israel as she is admired in the United States, but perspectives are shifting. Klagsbrun’s thorough and absorbing biography suggests this woman politician made history in more ways than one.PRESIDENT McKINLEY: Architect of the American Century, by Robert W. Merry. (Simon & Schuster, $35.) McKinley tends to be forgotten among American presidents, overshadowed by his successor, Theodore Roosevelt, but he was largely responsible for America’s 20th-century role in the world. Merry’s measured, insightful biography seeks to set the record straight, arguing that McKinley was shrewd and patient, and wily beneath the bland exterior.THE SHADOW DISTRICT, by Arnaldur Indridason. (Thomas Dunne/Minotaur, $25.99.) In this moody Icelandic mystery, a retired police officer investigates a present-day murder with apparent links to another crime, committed during the waning days of World War II, when the neutral nation was occupied by Allied troops.A BRIEF HISTORY OF EVERYONE WHO EVER LIVED: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes, by Adam Rutherford. (The Experiment, $25.95.) With a heady amalgam of science, history and a bit of anthropology, Rutherford offers a captivating primer on genetics and human evolution as told through our DNA.THE LAST BALLAD, by Wiley Cash. (Morrow/HarperCollins, $26.99.) Cash’s novel revisits a 1929 textile union strike that turned deadly; his heroine is based on a real-life union organizer and folk singer now mostly lost to history.CATAPULT: Stories, by Emily Fridlund.

Jerusalem is a red line and the resistance will not allow any desecration of it.”Senior Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh also called upon people to stand against efforts to “Judaize” Jerusalem, according to the official group account in Arabic.The warning follows reports that Trump will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Wednesday and will move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to the Holy City, although the process could take up to four years to complete.Hamas’ English social media accounts, which tend to offer a watered-down version of hostile statements, said the Palestinian leadership urges Palestinians to organize “demonstrations” against Israel and the U.S.Palestinian factions declare days of anger on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and to hold demonstrations in cities and in front of Israeli embassies and consulates.“Palestinian factions declare days of anger on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and to hold demonstrations in cities and in front of Israeli embassies and consulates,” Hamas\' Twitter account read.According to Hamas’ charter, which outlines key principles and policies, the terror group aims to establish a state of Palestine “with Jerusalem as its capital” and states that “not one stone” of the city can be given up.“Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine. Its religious, historic and civilizational status is fundamental to the Arabs, Muslims and the world at large. Its Islamic and Christian holy places belong exclusively to the Palestinian people and to the Arab and Islamic Ummah,” the charter reads.“Not one stone of Jerusalem can be surrendered or relinquished. The measures undertaken by the occupiers in Jerusalem, such as Judaization, settlement building, and establishing facts on the ground are fundamentally null and void.”Multiple Middle Eastern countries have come out against the decision to recognize Jerusalem, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan saying Monday that moving the capital was a “red line” for Muslims.Lukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Perhaps he’s just reciprocating; that same public rejected him after just over a year and a half in office, making him the shortest serving prime minister in Israeli history.The reason Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now serving in his fourth term is that the Israeli people know that he is strengthening the country, protecting its citizens, leading an unprecedented flourishing of Israel’s diplomatic relations and unleashing the full potential of its economy.Amazingly, Mr. Barak blames Prime Minister Netanyahu for the lack of peace. Apparently he forgot that he himself offered the Palestinians a state in nearly every inch of the West Bank in 2000. The Palestinians rejected that offer and launched the worst campaign of terror in Israel’s history, killing over a thousand men, women and children.Contrary to Mr. Barak’s spurious claims, Israel has a vibrant free press, a thriving civil society and an independent judiciary. Far from dividing Israelis, Prime Minister Netanyahu shows deep concern for all sectors of Israeli society (including Arab Israelis, whose communities he is supporting with unprecedented levels of funding), because he believes that all citizens should benefit from Israel’s economic miracle.Mr. Barak is welcome to try his hand at politics again, but his political future will undoubtedly end like his political past if he continues to besmirch and belittle the will of the Israeli people. Instead of making his case to The New York Times, he might try to convince his fellow citizens, for whom he has such obvious disdain and for whom the feeling is so clearly mutual.SHAI HAIK, JERUSALEMThe writer is the media adviser to the Likud chairman, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.', 'President announces efforts to move U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.President Trump on Wednesday formally recognized Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital, saying it\'s time to "acknowledge the obvious" as he ordered the State Department to begin moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.“I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,” the president said during a speech in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House.The move fulfills a campaign promise made to religious conservatives.

It’s something that has to be done.”\'I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\'Trump acknowledged the opposition from other countries in the Middle East to his decision, saying Vice President Mike Pence will be “traveling to the region” in the coming days.“There will of course be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement,” Trump said. “But we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a peace and place far greater in understanding and cooperation.”WHY TRUMP’S PROMISE TO MOVE U.S. EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM IS SO CONTROVERSIALDuring his remarks, Trump emphasized he is still committed to a peace deal between the two sides.“This decision is not intended in any way to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement," he said. "We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.”The U.S. would be the first country to move its embassy to Jerusalem, which is claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. Other countries that have diplomatic relations with Israel keep their embassies in Tel Aviv.U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Fox News\' "The Story with Martha MacCallum" that Trump\'s decision was "acknowledging something that’s common sense to everyone.""The [Knesset] is there, the prime minister is there, the Supreme Court -- that is the capital," Haley said. "And by us putting the embassy there, that’s a U.S. decision."But the embassy move would not be immediate and could take at least three or four years.The U.S. officials said there are currently about 1,000 personnel in the embassy in Tel Aviv. They added that there is no facility in Jerusalem ready to serve as the embassy site, and it will take time to address security, design and cost concerns.“This will immediately begin the process of hiring architects, engineers and planners so that a new embassy when completed will be a magnificent tribute to peace,” Trump said.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a televised message, thanked Trump for what he called a “courageous and just” decision.President #Trump’s Israel Firsts: •First @POTUS to visit #Israel on first trip abroad •First sitting U.S. president to visit the Western Wall•First U.S. president to recognize #Jerusalem as Israel’s capital https://t.co/e5SDC2Jrw6“This decision reflects the president’s commitment to an ancient but enduring truth,” Netanyahu said. “The president’s decision is an important step toward peace, for there is no peace that doesn’t include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.”He stressed there would be no change in the status quo at the holy sites and Israel will ensure “freedom of worship” for all faiths.Ahead of the announcement, Trump spoke Tuesday with Palestinian President Mahmood Abbas, Jordanian King Abdullah and Netanyahu.Abbas has warned of the “gravity of consequences” should the move become official for “the peace process and security and stability in the region and world.”Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is not in favor of the new U.S. stance toward Jerusalem. (AP)Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that recognizing the capital as Jerusalem was a “red line” for Muslims, and such an action could result in Turkey severing diplomatic ties with Israel."Courage doesn’t come by doing what everybody else says," Haley told Fox News Wednesday night. "Courage comes by doing what you know is right. This is the right thing to do and what the president’s doing is he’s showing leadership."The controversy surrounding the move of the embassy dates back decades. A law passed in 1995 under the Clinton administration considers Jerusalem the capital, and even mandates the move of the embassy there.But the law allows for a loophole used by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama – an option to issue waivers every six months to delay the move from Tel Aviv.Trump also took advantage of the loophole, which Republicans have long called to be closed. Trump’s first waiver was signed in June, which drew praise from the Palestinians and some disappointment from Israel.The administration officials said Tuesday that Trump will still sign a waiver to keep from jeopardizing State Department funding while the relocation process begins.Fox News\' Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Alex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

Mr. Mugabe mocked Mr. Trump as a “giant gold Goliath” and said other nations were “embarrassed if not frightened” by his statements about North Korea.“Are we having a return of Goliath to our midst, who threatens the extinction of other countries?” Mr. Mugabe asked. Some responded with applause to his reference to the biblical character who threatened the Israelites before being slain by the young shepherd David, who would become king.Mr. Mugabe then went on to address Mr. Trump directly, telling him to “blow your trumpet in a musical way towards the values of unity, peace, cooperation, togetherness and dialogue which we have always stood for.”During his speech, Mr. Trump notably omitted any talk of climate change, seen as one of the most pressing issues for many world leaders.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada received the longest applause during his General Assembly speech on Thursday after an implicit dig at Mr. Trump.“There is no country on the planet that can walk away from the challenge and reality of climate change,” Mr. Trudeau said, referring to Mr. Trump’s plans to pull out of the Paris climate accord.Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, was quick to embrace Mr. Trump’s paean to sovereignty.“It is gratifying to note, as the U.S. President Donald Trump unequivocally stated from this podium last Tuesday, that it is important to comply with the principles of sovereignty in international affairs,” Mr. Lavrov said during his General Assembly speech on Thursday.“I believe that anyone can sign on to these words,” he added.But Mr. Lavrov was also critical of Mr. Trump’s policies on Iran, saying the “world is watching with alarm as the U.S. imposes yet a new set of restrictions against Iran.”Sigmar Gabriel, the German foreign minister, delivered one of the toughest rebukes from a longtime American ally. Taking aim at Mr. Trump’s focus on sovereignty, he denounced the “national egoism” of his speech.“The motto ‘Our Country First’ not only leads to more national confrontations and less prosperity, in the end, there will only be losers,” Mr. Gabriel said Thursday.“This worldview describes the world as an arena, a kind of battleground, in which everyone is fighting against everyone else and in which everyone has to assert their own interests, either alone or in alliances of convenience,” Mr. Gabriel said. “In this worldview, the law of the strongest prevails, not the strength of the law.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel praised Mr. Trump’s speech in a series of Twitter messages sent shortly after the address.“President Trump spoke the truth about the great dangers facing our world and issued a powerful call to confront them in order to ensure the future of humanity,” Mr. Netanyahu wrote Tuesday.He also applauded Mr. Trump’s criticism of the Iran nuclear deal, an agreement that Israel has opposed from the beginning.Later in the day, Mr. Netanyahu echoed the sentiments in his own speech to the assembly.“I’ve listened to countless speeches in this hall, but I can say this: None were bolder, none more courageous and forthright than the one delivered by President Trump today,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “President Trump rightly called the nuclear deal with Iran, he called it an embarrassment.”President Hassan Rouhani of Iran did not hold back when it was his turn on the podium. While Mr. Rouhani did not mentioned the American president by name, he took clear aim at Mr. Trump on Wednesday.“It will be a great pity if this agreement were to be destroyed by rogue newcomers to the world of politics,” Mr. Rouhani said, referring to the nuclear accord between his country and six world powers. Mr. Trump had assailed the deal as “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.”Mr. Rouhani praised the agreement as a “model” and pledged that Iran would not be the first to violate it.About an hour later, he held an hourlong news conference, in which he demanded an apology from Mr. Trump for what he called “completely baseless allegations” about Iran.', 'Director of defense studies and senior editor for The National Interest explainsFormer Saudi Chief of Intelligence and Ambassador to the U.S. and U.K. Prince Turki al-Faisal is cautioning the Trump team to clarify its stance on defeating “the biggest terrorist in Syria” —the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad —while at the same time praising the clear, ironfisted strategy of the U.S. toward Iran.“Bashar al-Assad is the biggest terrorist. He has killed more people than Hamas, ISIS or al-Nusra,” Faisal said Sunday at the Middle East Policy Forum in New York, coordinated by the Israel Policy Forum, a think tank aimed at supporting and mobilizing the American Jewish community. “Therefore, the effort needs to be to convince Russia not to necessarily abandon, but to keep an arm’s distance from Mr. Assad. If that happens, we can get things happening in Syria.”Russia, a prominent opponent of regime change globally, long has supported the Syrian president and is largely credited for turning around the country’s bloody civil war after it joined the bombing campaign to support pro-Assad forces in September 2015.For his part, Assad consistently has acknowledged the brutal toll of the more than six-year war, which has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands and displaced millions, yet has insisted that their fight has not been against an “opposition,” but against terrorists littered across the country.Former Saudi Chief of Intelligence and Ambassador to the U.S and U.K, Prince Turki al-Faisal (right) spoke with Efraim Halevy, former director of Israel’s Mossad Security Agency, (left) Sunday about Syria and Iran Sunday at the Middle East Policy Forum in New York.            The “cure” to the global terrorism problem, Faisal stated, is to “fix the capitals” in countries across the Middle East and North Africa.“If you look across from Iraq to Syria to Lebanon to Yemen to across the sea to Libya, you see terrorist groups are thriving in these countries,” he said. “The best way to cure this is through viable and workable governments who can deal with these challenges. You have to fix the capitals.”He stressed that terrorist groups are merely “symptoms and political tools” for failing governments.Faisal also pointed out that while the American policy in Syria and toward Assad remains murky, he praised President Donald Trump’s clear and harsh stance toward Iran and recent refusal to certify their compliance to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran nuclear deal.DEFEATING ISIS ISN’T ENOUGH: TRUMP URGENTLY NEEDS A NEW SYRIA POLICY“If you want to put pressure on Iran, you have to do whatever it means to do that and decertification is one way of putting in that pressure to make them live up not just to the letter of the deal, but the spirit,” he said. “The signers of the deal when they signed it portrayed the holy picture that it was going to turn into a very friendly and open and hospitable place to do business with, but that hasn’t happened.”Rather, Faisal observed, the deal has “emboldened” Iran to cement its footprint further in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and the region at-large.“The basic failure of the deal was to deal with (these) Iranian extraterritorial ambitions,” he said.RUSSIA’S LAVROV WARNS ONE-SIDED CHANGES COULD SINK IRAN DEALFaisal was joined by Efraim Halevy, former director of Israel’s Mossad Security Agency, who instead reiterated the importance of ensuring the deal remains in place and countered that from an Israel point of view, they at least have time now —10 to 13 years —to deal with issues that were not included, such as terrorism and missile capabilities.“Israel is indestructible. We are able to, if necessary, protect ourselves and emerge intact. I have huge faith in our military establishment, our defense establishment, and our intelligence establishment. We are less indestructible than we ever were,” he said. “Having said that, the Iran deal was not an ideal deal. But this was because Israel did not wish the negotiations to include all the items on the agenda.”Rather, Halevy advocated that they wanted the United States to “focus on the nuclear issue and nothing else.”“We didn’t want to delay the deal, we wanted it to come as quickly as possible and be as effective as possible,” he added. “Things are happening in Iran today, changes are happening in Iran today.”The forum marked the first time Faisal had visited a synagogue in America, and he emphasized he hoped “it would not be the last.”Hollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

Now, the overgrown skeletons of buildings face a new threat: luxury apartments. Opponents want to preserve the town as an historic site.Until 1948, Lifta was an affluent Muslim Palestinian village of around 2,500 abutting the main road connecting Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Fighting between Jewish and Palestinian militias took place in and around Lifta in December 1947, including an attack on a cafe that left seven dead, prompting its residents to flee, according to historical accounts.After the war, the village was incorporated into the state of Israel, and the residents were not allowed to return.Mohammed Abu Eleil, 78, grew up in Lifta, though his family moved elsewhere in Jerusalem a year before hostilities broke out. As he wandered through the remnants of his home village with his 55-year-old son Nasir on a recent day, he recalled the "peaceful and good life" in the Lifta of his childhood."Nothing is more precious for the Arab man than his house," Abu Eleil said. "It is true that death is a disaster, but leaving or being expelled from your house is the biggest calamity for the Arab man."For reasons that remain unclear, Lifta was never demolished. After the war it briefly housed Jewish refugees, but most of its houses were abandoned again in the late 1960s. The roofs of the houses were blown open to prevent squatters from moving in.The village and its natural spring were later declared a nature reserve, and the rocky slope is covered in vegetation. Trees grow through some of the 55 remaining houses built before the 1948 war.But in 2011 a redevelopment plan was advanced to bulldoze the village ruins and the nature reserve— which today are part of one of the largest undeveloped tracts of land in the Jerusalem municipal area — into luxury residences, a hotel and shops. A group of Israeli and Palestinian activists, including descendants of the village\'s former inhabitants, pushed back against the plan, arguing Lifta should be preserved as a living monument.The Abu Eleils are involved with "Save Lifta," a coalition of Israeli and Palestinian environmentalists, political activists and researchers that has battled the development plan in Israeli courts for the past several years. Ilan Shtayer, the organization\'s coordinator, likened Lifta to Pompeii — "frozen in time."Former Lifta residents petitioned an Israeli court to halt the project, and in 2012 the court ordered the Israel Lands Authority to freeze the plan and carry out an extensive archaeological survey to map its historic remains.The survey was completed last December, and opponents of the development plan argue that the discovery of remains dating back thousands of years will force the state to scrap the project altogether. The Israel Lands Authority canceled a conference scheduled last Thursday to present the survey results.In a statement, the Lands Authority said the Lifta development plan would be advanced in the coming months, and that the plan would "place an emphasis on the preservation of antiquities in conjunction with the Jerusalem Municipality, the Israel Antiquities Authority and the relevant authorities."This month, the World Monuments Fund, a U.S.-based nonprofit working to conserve heritage sites around the globe, added Lifta to its watch list, warning that the redevelopment plan endangers the preservation of the site as "a rare place of heritage, recreation, and memory for the benefit of all citizens of Jerusalem."Shtayer envisions Lifta kept in stasis as "a memorial place to the catastrophe of \'48, this catastrophe that is common to Israelis and Palestinians," a reference to the mass displacement of Palestinians as a result of the war and the decades of bloodshed that have continued on both sides since then."Both of us 70 years after (are) still suffering from what happened here in \'48, and Lifta is the only place around that can tell the story of what happened here, the civilization that happened here before, and to let us think about a different, better future," he said.', 'Trump to Keep Embassy in Tel Aviv, but Recognize Jerusalem as Capital - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump plans to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital but not to move the American Embassy there for now, people briefed on the deliberations said on Friday, a halfway gesture intended to fulfill a campaign pledge while not derailing his peace initiative.Mr. Trump is expected to announce the decision in a speech next Wednesday, these people said, though they cautioned that the president had not yet formally signed off on it and that the details of the plan could shift.Those details, experts warned, are fiendishly complicated. The diplomatic status of Jerusalem is one of the world’s most contested issues, with Israel and the Palestinians claiming it as their capital. Its holy sites are sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, and any change in its status would have vast repercussions across the Middle East and other Islamic-majority countries worldwide.Mr. Trump promised to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv as one of his first acts as president — a pledge that was popular with his evangelical supporters as well as with powerful Jewish donors, like the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson.American presidents must sign a national security waiver every six months to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv. In June, Mr. Trump deferred a decision to move it to Jerusalem, under pressure from Arab leaders, who warned that it would ignite protests, and from advisers, including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who worried that it could strangle the administration’s attempt to foster peace in the generations-long dispute.With another deadline looming next Monday, Mr. Trump is expected to sign an order keeping the embassy in Tel Aviv. But he will couple that with a statement that the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital — something that no president, Republican or Democrat, has done since the state of Israel was established in 1948.Given the extreme sensitivities surrounding Jerusalem, Middle East experts said Mr. Trump’s plan was fraught with risk. Even after extensive consultations with Arab leaders, which the White House has not done, such a move could provoke volatile reactions.“The devil is in the details of what they announce,” said Martin S. Indyk, who served as American ambassador to Israel under President Bill Clinton. “If this is not framed properly, far from resolving this issue, it will land the administration in even hotter water.”Among the questions, Mr. Indyk said, are whether Mr. Trump will restrict recognition to West Jerusalem, whether he will mention Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem and how he will deal with Jerusalem’s status as a holy city — a factor that could determine whether Saudi Arabia supports or abandons his peace project.News of Mr. Trump’s decision came amid fresh disclosures about how, even before he took office, he worked closely with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to scuttle a United Nations Security Council resolution critical of Israel’s settlement policy — subverting then-President Barack Obama, who had decided to allow a vote to go ahead.Documents filed in connection with the guilty plea of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, revealed that on Dec. 22, 2016, a “very senior member” of Mr. Trump’s transition team instructed Mr. Flynn to contact foreign officials, including from Russia, “to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution.”Lawyers identified the senior transition official as Mr. Kushner. Russia rebuffed Mr. Flynn’s request and voted for the resolution, which passed after the United States abstained.Mr. Trump has kept up his close relations with Mr. Netanyahu, though that may be tested if, as expected, the White House tries to jump-start peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians early next year.While Mr. Netanyahu supports the decision to move the American Embassy, Israeli officials have not pushed the issue in recent months. Other leaders in the region, like King Abdullah II of Jordan, remain deeply opposed to it.But Mr. Trump was under immense pressure from pro-Israel and evangelical supporters and is likely to repeat past assertions that it is not a matter of if, but when, the embassy will be moved to Jerusalem. He is also being pressed to declare that next week’s waiver will be his last — effectively promising to devise a plan by mid-2018 to begin relocating the embassy.Declaring Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital would not itself mark a change in American law. In 1995, Mr. Clinton signed a statute declaring, “Since 1950, the city of Jerusalem has been the capital of the State of Israel.” But administrations have been allowed to decide, as a matter of policy, whether to recognize it as the capital, and none have done so.That law requires the embassy to be moved to Jerusalem, unless the president issues a waiver finding that doing so would be against national security interests of the United States. American presidents have done so every six months since then to avoid prejudging the outcome of — and therefore hampering — an eventual resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump vowed to change course. At the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March 2016, he said he would “move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.”But he signed a waiver on June 1, and officials said Mr. Adelson was among the supporters who were deeply disappointed by the president’s decision.Among those pressing hardest for moving the embassy, said people close to the deliberations, was Vice President Mike Pence, who has been a conduit for Mr. Trump to religious conservatives. In a speech in New York on Tuesday, he said Mr. Trump was “actively considering when and how to move the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.”In the short run, the decision could complicate plans for Mr. Kushner and Jason D. Greenblatt, Mr. Trump’s special envoy, to restart peace negotiations. Palestinian officials have warned that Mr. Trump is “playing with fire.”“If you’re trying to be creative by saying we’re recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, you’d better qualify it,” said Dennis B. Ross, a longtime Middle East peace negotiator. “If you don’t qualify it, that means you’ve just accepted the Israeli position on the final status of Jerusalem, which means you’ve lost the Arabs.”', 'U.N., European Union and Pope Criticize Trump’s Jerusalem Announcement - The New York TimesROME — Pope Francis said, “I cannot remain silent.” The United Nations secretary general spoke of his “great anxiety.” The European Union expressed “serious concern.” American allies like Britain, France, Germany and Italy all declared it a mistake.A chorus of international leaders criticized the Trump administration’s decision on Wednesday to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, calling it a dangerous disruption that contravenes United Nations resolutions and could inflame one of the world’s thorniest conflicts.Secretary General António Guterres and Pope Francis both expressed alarm that the announcement would provoke new tensions in the Holy City, which is revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims.Within minutes of Mr. Trump’s speech, in which he said the American Embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Mr. Guterres delivered what amounted to a diplomatic rebuke.Reading a statement outside the Security Council chambers at United Nations headquarters in New York, Mr. Guterres criticized “any unilateral measures that would jeopardize the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians,” underscoring the administration’s departure from decades of American policy.“Jerusalem is a final-status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli sides,” Mr. Guterres said.“In this moment of great anxiety, I want to make it clear: There is no alternative to the two-state solution,” he said. “There is no Plan B.”In Rome, Pope Francis prayed that Jerusalem’s status be preserved and needless conflict avoided.“I cannot remain silent about my deep concern for the situation that has developed in recent days,” Francis said at his weekly general audience at the Vatican. “And at the same time, I wish to make a heartfelt appeal to ensure that everyone is committed to respecting the status quo of the city, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.”“Jerusalem is a unique city,” he said, “sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, where the Holy Places for the respective religions are venerated, and it has a special vocation to peace.”In especially strong language, the pope added, “I pray to the Lord that such identity be preserved and strengthened for the benefit of the Holy Land, the Middle East and the entire world, and that wisdom and prudence prevail, to avoid adding new elements of tension in a world already shaken and scarred by many cruel conflicts.”The European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, expressed concern about “the repercussions this may have on the prospect of peace.”In a statement, she reiterated the bloc’s position that Jerusalem should be a future capital of two states, Israeli and Palestinian, and that embassies should not be moved there until the city’s final status was resolved. She cited a 1980 United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned Israel’s attempted annexation of East Jerusalem as a violation of international law.She called on actors in the region “to show calm and restraint in order to prevent any escalation.”Within a few hours of Mr. Trump’s speech, eight countries on the 15-member Security Council — including some of America’s closest allies — requested an emergency meeting to be held before the end of the week. Diplomats said it would most likely be scheduled for Friday.Joakim Vaverka, political coordinator of Sweden’s United Nations mission, said in a statement that the delegations of Bolivia, Britain, Egypt, France, Italy, Senegal, Sweden and Uruguay had sought the meeting, including a briefing by Mr. Guterres, “in light of the statement today by the president of the United States regarding the status of Jerusalem.”The warnings by the pope, the United Nations and the European Union spoke to a broad fear that Mr. Trump’s announcement would be the death knell for an already moribund peace process and that it would pull the plug on a two-state solution.Critics of the announcement said the change in policy removed any pretense that the United States is a neutral broker for peace. Palestinians and other Arabs in the region already view the Trump administration as leaning toward Israel’s right-wing government. The change in American policy “destroys the peace process,” said the Palestinian prime minister, Rami Hamdallah.Some of the United States’ closest allies expressed apprehension.Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain called Mr. Trump’s decision “unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region.”President Emmanuel Macron of France, who was in Algeria on Wednesday meeting with the country’s president and other figures, said in a news conference that the decision by Mr. Trump was “regrettable” and that “France and Europe are committed to a two-state solution.” He called on all parties to refrain from violence.Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, said through a spokesman that her government “does not support this position, because the status of Jerusalem is to be resolved in the framework of a two-state solution.”Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy wrote on Twitter: “Jerusalem holy city, unique on earth. Its future will be defined within the framework of the peace process based on the two states, Israel and Palestine.”In China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Geng Shuang, expressed support for a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and urged all parties to the conflict to proceed cautiously. “What we worry about is any potential flare-up of regional tensions,” he said. “The status of Jerusalem is a complicated and sensitive issue.”Britain’s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, told reporters in Brussels, “Clearly this is a decision that makes it more important than ever that the long-awaited American proposals on the Middle East peace process are now brought forward.”That process, led by Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has seemingly failed to get off the ground.Leaders in the region had already warned against the move. A statement from the royal palace of King Abdullah II of Jordan, whose kingdom is the custodian of Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, emphasized that the city was critical to “achieving peace and stability in the region and the world.”In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was convening a summit meeting of the main Pan-Islamic body next week in Istanbul to discuss the American move and to show, as his spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told reporters in Ankara, “joint action among Islamic countries.”Mr. Kalin called the expected change a “grave mistake,” adding that “Jerusalem is our honor, Jerusalem is our common cause, Jerusalem is our red line.”Iran, unsurprisingly, condemned the change. Its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said at a conference in Tehran on Wednesday that it reflected the “incompetence and failure” of the American government.Like much of Europe, the Vatican has long been sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians. The Vatican established full diplomatic relations with Israel in 1994, and Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI visited Israel and the Palestinian territories.In 2012, the Vatican called for “an internationally guaranteed special statute” for Jerusalem, with the goal of “safeguarding the freedom of religion and of conscience, the identity and sacred character of Jerusalem as a Holy City, (and) respect for, and freedom of, access to its holy places.”Francis visited the Holy Land in 2014, but he upset some Israelis by flying by helicopter directly from Jordan to the “State of Palestine,” as the Vatican schedule at the time referred to the territories. He visited Israel afterward.In 2015, the Vatican entered into a treaty with the “State of Palestine.”On Tuesday, Francis spoke by telephone to the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, about the unfolding crisis. Before the pope’s public remarks to the faithful at the Vatican on Wednesday, he met privately with a group of Palestinians participating in interfaith dialogue with officials at the Vatican.“The Holy Land is for us Christians the land par excellence of dialogue between God and mankind,” he said. “The primary condition of that dialogue is reciprocal respect and a commitment to strengthening that respect, for the sake of recognizing the rights of all people, wherever they happen to be.”', 'Trump Calls Jerusalem Plan Step Toward Peace, but It Puts Mideast on Edge - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — Palestinians burned photos of President Trump in Gaza, and the walls of the Old City were illuminated with the American and Israeli flags on Wednesday, as Mr. Trump made good on his campaign pledge to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.In a much-anticipated speech from the White House, Mr. Trump argued that it was “the right thing to do” to acknowledge the reality that Jerusalem is the seat of Israel’s government. Decades of avoiding that fact, he said, has done little to resolve the protracted feud between Israelis and Palestinians.“It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result,” Mr. Trump declared. Recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, he said, is “a long overdue step to advance the peace process.”Mr. Trump said that the United States still wanted a negotiated peace agreement — and “would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides” — and that he was not seeking to dictate the boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in the fiercely contested Holy City.“There will, of course, be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement,” the president said. He appealed for “calm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate.”Mr. Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem isolates the United States on one of the world’s most sensitive diplomatic issues. It drew a storm of criticism from Arab and European leaders, including some of America’s closest allies.Many said that Mr. Trump’s move was destabilizing, that it risked setting off violence and that it would make achieving peace even more difficult. It also threw into doubt his ability to maintain the United States’ longstanding role as a mediator of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Mr. Trump’s break with policy and international consensus included setting into motion a plan to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Although that will not happen right away, Palestinians saw it as a deep affront.The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, a veteran of the peace process, said bitterly that the United States had effectively scrapped it. Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, called for the abandonment of a two-state solution altogether.Among Israelis, however, Mr. Trump’s announcement drew praise, not only from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government but also from liberal opposition leaders. “The Jewish people and the Jewish state will be forever grateful,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a video, calling Mr. Trump’s decision “courageous and just” and “an important step towards peace.”Yair Lapid, the leader of Yesh Atid, a center-left opposition party, said: “Policies should not be dictated by threats and intimidation. If violence is the only argument against moving the embassy to Jerusalem, then it only proves it is the right thing to do.”Naftali Bennett, the education minister and leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party, said American recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital “shows that Israel’s strategic patience has paid off.”“We have been told again and again that if we want more acceptance, we have to cut off parts of Israel and hand them over to our enemies,” he said. “What we are learning is the contrary: The world respects strong countries who believe in themselves and looks down on countries willing to give up their homeland.”Yet Israelis also braced for violence, as some Palestinian leaders urged a third intifada, or armed uprising.Fatah, Hamas and other Palestinian factions called a general strike for Thursday, urging residents of the West Bank and Gaza to join marches in every city, and officials said the Palestinian schools would be closed. Hamas, an Islamic militant group, said Mr. Trump’s decision would “open the gates of hell,” and Islamic Jihad called it a “declaration of war.”By late Wednesday night, there were only scattered, unconfirmed reports of gunfire and clashes with security forces in several West Bank cities.But the United States Consulate General in Jerusalem barred American government employees and their families from visiting Jerusalem’s Old City and the West Bank, including Bethlehem, already decorated for Christmas. Government workers were permitted to conduct essential travel only. American citizens were advised to avoid crowds.In Jordan, the United States Embassy said it had suspended routine public services, limited the public movements of employees and their families and instructed them not to send their children to school on Thursday.But even as Arab and Muslim leaders across the Middle East condemned Mr. Trump’s announcement, doubts were raised about the stamina of the anger. The Palestinian issue, long a binding force in Arab politics, has slipped in importance in recent years, overshadowed by other conflicts. Still, the American decision risked a backlash with unpredictable consequences.Palestinians across the political spectrum said Mr. Trump’s decision was so biased toward Israel that he had irrevocably harmed his administration’s ability to be seen as a fair broker.Analysts noted that Mr. Trump had said nothing about Palestinian aspirations to make East Jerusalem the capital of a state side-by-side with Israel.Mr. Trump made no distinction between the western portions of the city and East Jerusalem. The Old City landmarks he invoked — the Western Wall holy to Jews, the stations of the cross sacred to Christians, and Al-Aqsa mosque, which is cherished by Muslims — are all east of the 1967 line, in what the rest of the world still considers occupied territory, said Nathan Thrall, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the International Crisis Group.Mr. Trump’s formulation that the United States “would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides,” too, amounted to a rolling back of United States policy flatly supporting a two-state solution, said Daniel Kurtzer, a Princeton professor and former ambassador to Israel under President George W. Bush.“There’s really not much for Abbas to hang onto if he wanted to stay in the game with the U.S.,” Mr. Kurtzer said.Mr. Trump’s decision was driven by a campaign pledge. He appealed to evangelicals and ardently pro-Israel American Jews when running for president in 2016 by vowing to move the embassy. Advisers said he was determined to make good on his word.But the president still plans to sign a national security waiver to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for an additional six months, even as the relocation plan moves ahead.White House officials argued that Mr. Trump’s decision would bolster his credibility as a peacemaker by showing he can be trusted to deliver on promises. They also argued that by taking the contentious issue of Jerusalem off the table, Mr. Trump had removed a recurring source of ambiguity.Those arguments were rejected by Mr. Abbas, who said in a televised speech Wednesday night that Mr. Trump’s actions “constitute a deliberate undermining of all peace efforts” and amounted to a “withdrawal” from America’s role.The decisions on the embassy and recognition of Jerusalem “also reward Israel for denying agreements and defying international resolutions, and encourage Israel to pursue the policy of occupation, settlement, apartheid and ethnic cleansing,” Mr. Abbas said, speaking in Arabic that was translated by Wafa, the Palestinian news agency.Yet the Palestinians, weak and divided, did not appear to have many good options or any clear, ready response.Some raised the idea of severing security cooperation with Israel, but that cooperation also helps preserve Mr. Abbas’s authority. And breaking more forcefully with the United States could jeopardize the vast sums of aid the Palestinian Authority receives from Washington.Mr. Abbas said he would focus on reconciliation efforts with Hamas to face the new challenge. But the American declaration could actually hurt those efforts.“This development will push Hamas to become more hard-line,” said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political scientist at Birzeit University in the West Bank. “Abbas will not change his political line, so the gap will grow.”Diana Buttu, a Palestinian lawyer-activist and former aide to Mr. Abbas, said the peace process had failed him. “He has to switch tactics,” she said, pointing to international measures like the boycott-divestment-sanctions campaign and pressing charges against Israelis in the International Criminal Court.“Doing nothing is no longer an option,” she said.Mr. Thrall, the analyst, said the two-state strategy had been losing credibility among Palestinians for some time, particularly among the young. And Mr. Trump’s actions, he said, would push more Palestinians toward what he called “a rights-based struggle for equality,” and “a one-state, South African model for Palestinians.”“Nothing better symbolizes for Palestinians the idiocy of the strategy that their leaders have been pursuing and the absolute fruitlessness of it than what just happened at the White House today,” he said.Israel’s standing in the world generally suffers when there is no prospect of peace negotiations. But Israelis on both the right and left dismissed the notion that Mr. Trump’s declaration was a death knell.The right described it as more of a reality check. “It doesn’t matter what Trump says,” said Efraim Inbar, president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies, a conservative think tank. “It matters if the Palestinians are ready to compromise on this issue or not.”Still, Mr. Netanyahu could now face a new set of political problems from Mr. Trump’s announcement, including increased pressure from key allies to press Israel’s advantage over the Palestinians.Already, there is a push to redraw the boundaries of Jerusalem to eject much of its Arab population and add tens of thousands of residents to Israeli settlements.“The problem he’s going to have is, will he now be able to control the appetites of those in his coalition who want to do even more?” Mr. Kurtzer said.Others warned that Israel might have to pay a price down the road if Mr. Trump — assuming he is serious about peacemaking — offers a concession to the Palestinians.“The next time Trump wants something from Israel,” said Nachman Shai, a Labor Party member of the Knesset, “I’d like to see who will say no.”', 'Praise and Alarm From American Jews Over Trump’s Jerusalem Move - The New York TimesIf he was hoping for thunderous applause from American Jews, President Trump may be disappointed.His announcement on Wednesday that he will recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital went down well with those on the political right, who have urged the step for years. They will be telling him so at the White House Hanukkah party on Thursday, they said.But other Jewish leaders said they were more worried than glad, fearing that the precipitous step would inflame tensions in the region, provoke more terrorism, put peace with the Palestinians even farther out of reach, and worsen the diplomatic isolation of both Israel and the United States. They say they wish he had held off, as previous presidents have done.“Jerusalem has always been the most delicate issue in every discussion about peace,” said Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, the largest branch of American Judaism. “So we’re very concerned that the announcement will either delay or undermine the very, very important resuming of a serious peace process.”Debra DeLee, the president of Americans for Peace Now, an affiliate of the Israeli peace group Shalom Achshav, said, “Trump is causing severe damage to the prospects of Middle East peace, imperiling lives, and degrading U.S. leadership.”Jewish leaders are not alone in expressing alarm at Mr. Trump’s move. Leaders of other faiths decried it, including Pope Francis, Orthodox patriarchs and Protestant church leaders in Jerusalem and the United States, and Muslims around the world.The words Mr. Trump uttered about Jerusalem sounded sweet to many Jews, who belong to a faith that has revered the city as its holiest site for 3,000 years. But Jerusalem is also holy to Christians and to Muslims, and for centuries, attempts by any side to take exclusive control have brought trouble. Balancing their competing claims has been seen as the stickiest part of any peace effort.American Jews are debating whether Mr. Trump’s decision to end decades of diplomatic ambiguity and recognize the disputed city as the Israeli capital will help or hurt Israel and the effort to make a lasting peace with the Palestinians, who also want Jerusalem for their capital. Israel, long a unifying cause among American Jews, has increasingly become a point of polarization, and Mr. Trump’s move may only deepen that divide.There were Jewish leaders who celebrated the president’s announcement on Wednesday as a historic step that many Jews had longed for, and that might shake things up enough to restart the stalled Middle East peace process.Nathan J. Diament, executive director of public policy for the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, said in an interview, “This move puts pressure where it belongs, which is on the Palestinians and on Arab governments that support the Palestinians, because it sends the message that you can’t just sit still and refuse to be in negotiations and, oh, by the way, sponsor terrorism, and think that everything is just going to remain status quo.”Mr. Diament said he was not troubled by the criticism from some Jewish leaders that by taking sides on Jerusalem, Mr. Trump had squandered America’s ability to serve as an “honest broker,” or mediator, between the Israelis and Palestinians.“I’ve never thought the U.S. should be an honest broker,” said Mr. Diament, who represents the largest umbrella group of Orthodox Jews, who comprise about 10 percent of American Jews. “Pro-Israel Americans aren’t looking for the U.S. to be an honest broker. Pro-Israel Americans are looking to the U.S. to be a friend to our ally, Israel.”Jewish organizations like B’nai B’rith International and the American Jewish Committee also welcomed the president’s decision. But liberal groups that are critical of the right-wing Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu and have a following among younger Jews, like IfNotNow and Jewish Voice for Peace, protested the move and promised to rally against it.They said it would lead to the displacement of more Palestinians from East Jerusalem and would entrench the Israeli military occupation of Palestinian land, deepening grievances and making any kind of acceptable compromise harder for both sides to reach.American Jews as a group tend to vote overwhelmingly for Democrats, and only about 24 percent of Jews who voted in the 2016 presidential election backed Mr. Trump. Soon after he took office, Mr. Trump appointed his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as his chief negotiator for the Middle East, but neither man has made public any details about the contours or status of the process.In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that his decision on Jerusalem “is not intended in any way to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement.” He continued, “We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis, and a great deal for the Palestinians.”A question that divides many American Jews, though, is how to get there.At the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, where more than 6,000 leaders of the Union for Reform Judaism were beginning to gather on Wednesday for their biennial convention, the group’s president said he was still assessing Mr. Trump’s speech.To hear Jerusalem recognized as the capital of Israel, Rabbi Jacobs said, “is the age-old dream of the Jewish people and all of us who love and care about Israel.”He said he was open to the possibility that the move could prove to be a “concrete step closer to a peace process.”“Or will it be an obstacle?” he said. “Only time will tell.”', 'Saudi Arabia Comes for Hezbollah - The New York TimesLebanon was stunned on Nov. 4 when its prime minister, Saad Hariri, speaking from Saudi Arabia, delivered a halting resignation speech. Mr. Hariri said he left Beirut because he feared assassination. He placed the blame for his long-distance resignation on Iran and its main ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah.In the days since, Saudi Arabia has accused Hezbollah of plotting against the kingdom and ordered Saudi citizens to leave Lebanon. Threats from top Saudi officials are causing new turmoil in a tiny country with complicated sectarian politics, failed power-sharing arrangements and a long history of foreign meddling.Since the Arab uprisings in 2011, Lebanon has largely avoided the conflicts sweeping the Middle East. Even the war that is raging in Syria, Lebanon’s much larger neighbor, has generally left the country unscathed. That calm is now threatened as the Trump administration and Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab allies set their sights on Hezbollah and its patron, Iran.Why would Saudi leaders risk a new conflagration? They see a way to make common cause with Washington by targeting Hezbollah, one of Iran’s most effective allies. President Trump has consistently singled out Iran’s support for Hezbollah and other groups that Washington considers terrorist organizations.But Saudi Arabia is already overstretched. Its war against Houthi rebels in Yemen drags on, and the diplomatic dispute with Qatar remains in a stalemate, too. If Saudi leaders think they can score an easy victory in Lebanon against Hezbollah, it will be another misjudgment that adds to a dangerous and combustible moment in the Middle East.Hezbollah was part of Lebanon’s national unity government formed in late 2016 with Mr. Hariri as the prime minister. Iran and Saudi Arabia — which views itself as the protector of Lebanon’s Sunni community — blessed the power-sharing agreement.Hezbollah agreed to the deal because it wanted to avoid conflict in Lebanon and to direct its energy toward the Syrian war, where it fights alongside the government of President Bashar al-Assad. As a leader with strong ties to both the Sunni Arab states and the West, Mr. Hariri provided Hezbollah with political cover as it continued to dominate Lebanon.The militia’s important role in the fighting in Syria has made it more powerful than ever. But Mr. Hariri’s resignation exposes Hezbollah and its allies in the Lebanese government to harsher United States sanctions, a potential war with Israel or even an economic blockade led by Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab allies, similar to the one imposed on Qatar.Hezbollah, which was founded in the 1980s during a civil war and an Israeli invasion, is now the country’s dominant political and military force. It is unrealistic of Saudi leaders and the Trump administration to expect that it can be supplanted by a popular Lebanese groundswell against it or removed by a foreign military force without causing catastrophic damage to Lebanon.Saudi Arabia’s new ruler, King Salman, and his son and designated heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are pursuing a far more aggressive foreign policy than previous Saudi rulers. They have been bolstered in this by Mr. Trump’s support for the kingdom in its conflict with Iran. Now that Iran’s ally, Mr. Assad, has essentially won the civil war in Syria, Saudi Arabia is looking to contain Iranian influence elsewhere. Lebanon is a tempting target.The Saudis have also been emboldened by their recent outreach to Shiite factions in Iraq, especially the nationalist cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who visited the kingdom in July and met with Prince Mohammed. The Saudis are hoping to cultivate Mr. Sadr and other Shiite leaders who can be a counterweight to Iranian influence in Iraq, especially ahead of parliamentary elections next year.But the Saudis won’t be able to find a Sadr in Lebanon, a political figure who can offer a serious alternative to Hezbollah and Iranian influence in the Shiite community.Since the end of Lebanon’s civil war in 1990, Hezbollah has entrenched itself in the largely Shiite areas of southern Beirut and southern Lebanon. With Iranian support, it opened schools and hospitals, provided business loans and fielded candidates for parliamentary elections. It also extended its military capability, deploying thousands of missiles along the border with Israel.In February 2005, Rafik Hariri, a billionaire construction tycoon and Lebanon’s former prime minister, was assassinated in a bombing in Beirut. His death deprived Lebanon of its most prominent Sunni leader — and Saudi Arabia lost its most important Lebanese ally. After Mr. Hariri’s death, his son Saad took over his father’s Saudi-based construction empire and the Sunni political mantle in Lebanon.In the summer of 2006, Hezbollah fought a monthlong war with Israel, which ended in a draw and increased the militia’s popularity across the Muslim world. But by early 2011, Hezbollah’s standing began to wane after a United Nations tribunal indicted several of its members for Mr. Hariri’s assassination.If Mr. Hariri’s killing was a first salvo of the proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Lebanon, subsequent battles also did not go Riyadh’s way.In May 2008, Hezbollah broke a post-civil-war vow not to turn its weapons against other Lebanese factions. At the time, Lebanon was mired in a political stalemate between a United States- and Saudi-backed government — which included Sunni, Christian and Druze parties — and Hezbollah and its allies.Hezbollah was infuriated by a government decision that outlawed its underground fiber-optic communication network, which was critical to its success during its 2006 war with Israel. Hezbollah’s leaders sent hundreds of fighters into largely Sunni neighborhoods of West Beirut. They overpowered Sunni militiamen and seized the offices and media outlets of political rivals, including Mr. Hariri.Hezbollah’s success so alarmed the Sunni Arab states that Saudi Arabia toyed with the idea of sending an Arab military force to intervene in Lebanon. Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister at the time, asked a visiting American diplomat whether the United States and NATO could provide equipment, logistics and “naval and air cover” to assist such an army, according to a classified American diplomatic cable disclosed by WikiLeaks. Prince Faisal warned Washington that Hezbollah’s actions would lead to an “Iranian takeover of all Lebanon.”Years later, Saudi leaders organized a similar force to wage their war in Yemen, against Houthi rebels allied with Iran. A day after Mr. Hariri’s resignation, the front page of a Saudi-owned pan-Arab newspaper declared, “Hariri departs Hezbollah’s republic.” The subtext was clear: Without its most prominent Sunni leader, Lebanon is under Hezbollah’s full control — and it will be fair game in the latest battle with Iran.', 'JERUSALEM – A former Israeli combat officer turned whistleblower has found himself in the fight of his lifetime, leading a campaign against Israel\'s occupation of the West Bank and drawing relentless criticism from the country\'s leaders who have labeled him a traitor.For Dean Issacharoff, the battle is even more personal: his father is Israel\'s ambassador to Germany, a respected longtime diplomat tasked with defending the same policies his son so adamantly opposes.Issacharoff is the spokesman of Breaking the Silence, a group of former fighters who served in the West Bank and now collect testimonies about the damaging impact of the occupation. While the group says it\'s acting in Israel\'s best interests by sparking a public debate, it has become perhaps the most reviled anti-occupation protest group in the country. The nationalist government sees it as foreign-funded subversives seeking to shame Israel by targeting its most hallowed institution, the military.Amid a larger campaign to crack down on dovish advocacy groups that rely on donations from foreign governments, Breaking the Silence has drawn the most scorn for touching on a sensitive nerve. The government has responded by shunning foreign dignitaries who meet with its members and pushing for legislation to curb its funding."We are soldiers who have been there and seen what the occupation does. We have earned our right to speak," said Yehuda Shaul, a co-founder of the group. "They are trying to intimidate people into not opening their mouths about the occupation."The current clamor around Breaking the Silence was sparked when Issacharoff, seeking to highlight the corrosive effect of his own service, publicly shared how he once kneed an unarmed Palestinian in the face until he was bloodied and dazed because he had resisted arrest. The confession sparked an inquiry that nationalist critics hoped would either find Issacharoff guilty or prove he was a liar.After a swift investigation, the state prosecutor\'s office announced last week it was closing the case because it deemed Issacharoff\'s testimony to be false — a decision welcomed by hard-liners long opposed to the group as vindication."Breaking the Silence lies and defames our soldiers around the world. Today we got more proof of that, if anyone had a doubt," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted after the announcement.But since then, questions have arisen over the state\'s investigation. The group says the probe was politically motivated and bungled from the start, with investigators interviewing the wrong Palestinian victim and refraining from questioning fellow soldiers who backed Issacharoff\'s account. Issacharoff himself says he wants to be tried for his actions to highlight the moral price Israel is paying for its occupation of lands captured in the 1967 Mideast war."The right-wing government is afraid of the truth, and with good reason. Because if I take responsibility for my violence, they will have to take responsibility for sending us to serve in the territories," he said in a video statement. "As long as there is occupation, there will be soldiers who break their silence. I know what I did and no political campaign will be able to change that. These hands beat a Palestinian in the territories. I am not proud of it but I won\'t let you hide reality."On the advice of his attorney, Issacharoff declined to speak to The Associated Press.In a heated television debate, deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely called members of Breaking the Silence "liars" and "traitors," and later instructed Israeli embassies in Europe to seize on Issacharoff\'s case to press local governments to stop their funding of "an organization based on lies."That put his father, Jeremy Issacharoff, Israel\'s ambassador to Germany, in the uncomfortable position of having to denounce his own son. A nationalist advocacy group then launched a drive to have Jeremy Issacharoff fired because of his son.The uproar prompted Issacharoff\'s mother to plea with politicians to "stop using incendiary and hateful language" against soldiers who risked their lives for the country."Such words undermine any respectful public discussion and are inciteful," she wrote on Facebook.Hotovely later took a step back, calling Jeremy Issacharoff an "esteemed diplomat.""Our ambassador in Berlin is an excellent man of values, and we must draw a distinction between his diplomatic activity and his son\'s participation in an organization that is problematic for Israel," she said.It\'s not the first time Germany has been drawn into the commotion over Breaking the Silence.Earlier this year, Netanyahu canceled a meeting with visiting German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel because he insisted on meeting the group. Netanyahu, who also serves as foreign minister, said that henceforth snubbing visitors who meet with Breaking the Silence would be official policy.Since 2004, the group has collected testimony from more than 1,100 soldiers describing the dark side of Israel\'s military rule, including seemingly routine mistreatment of Palestinian civilians.Instead of sparking the public debate they had hoped for, the former fighters found themselves branded as public enemies who hide behind anonymous testimony to smear Israeli soldiers, fuel boycott calls against the country and help its enemies press future war crime charges against it.Even those sympathetic to their cause have bemoaned how they have aired their criticisms to foreign audiences rather than keep the argument in house.Shaul insists the group vets all soldiers\' testimonies carefully and submits its material to the military censor before publication, to avoid inadvertently harming Israeli security. He said the government — and large segments of the public — cannot handle the inconvenient truth and that the Issacharoff saga was just the latest attempt to clamp down on legitimate criticism."We want our army to be a defense force, not an occupation force. Over time, that is just something you cannot morally defend and it is a strategic threat to Israel," he said. "But all they (the government) want to do is attack anyone who speaks out against it."____Follow Aron Heller at HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/aronhellerap"', 'BEIRUT – Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri\'s bombshell resignation in a televised speech from Saudi Arabia took the nation by surprise Saturday.In his announcement, Hariri accused Iran and its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, of holding Lebanon hostage and destabilizing the Arab region.But what is behind his resignation and what does it mean for Lebanon?THE BACKGROUNDHariri became prime minister in late 2016 in a coalition government that included the Shiite militant group Hezbollah.It has been an uneasy partnership between Hariri, a Sunni Muslim aligned with Saudi Arabia, and Hezbollah, Iran\'s Shiite proxy in Lebanon, which has sent thousands of its fighters to shore up President Bashar Assad\'s forces in Syria\'s civil war.As Hezbollah and Iranian-backed Syrian troops made successive military victories, Hariri came under pressure from Washington and Riyadh to distance himself from the group.In recent days, Lebanese government ministers have bickered publicly over sending an ambassador to Damascus and repatriation plans for hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees living in Lebanon. Officials denied the tension threatened the unity government.Then suddenly, Hariri flew to Saudi Arabia earlier this week in a previously unannounced trip. He flew again to Riyadh Friday.It is not clear what exactly prompted his shock resignation — unprecedented in the way it was announced in a televised address from an undisclosed location in Riyadh. Even close aides seemed not to know it was coming.In his speech, Hariri said he feared for his life, suggesting he may not be coming home soon. Hariri was prime minister from 2009 until 2011, when Hezbollah ousted him from office. He had until last year lived in self-imposed exile in Saudi Arabia and France.SAUDI IRAN RIVALRYHariri\'s resignation is a reflection of the growing power struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia in the region. The Iran-Saudi rivalry is rooted in both countries\' claim to represent different strands of Islam, Shiite and Sunni, a more than thousand-year-old dispute. Iran\'s Islamic revolution in 1979 unsettled the ultraconservative Sunni Kingdom. But the explosive modern race grew with Iran\'s rising influence in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, where Tehran is supporting various players.Hezbollah, one of Tehran\'s most reliable partners, has been a key player in the wars in Syria and Yemen, undermining Saudi clout in Syria, and reaching the kingdom\'s borders by supporting Yemen\'s anti-Saudi rebels.With the ascension of the ambitious firebrand Mohammed Bin Salman to crown prince in Saudi Arabia, the rivalry with Tehran took a sharper turn. In one interview, he threatened to take the war to Iran.WHAT HAPPENS NOWHariri\'s resignation has to be accepted by President Michel Aoun, a formality. It effectively shatters the national unity government and plunges the country into uncertainty and potentially a prolonged period of political paralysis.Aoun must appoint a new prime minister, but it will be difficult to find a consensual Sunni figure able to form another coalition government. According to Lebanon\'s sectarian-based power-sharing system, the president must be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Muslim Sunni and the parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim.A new government that leans further toward Hezbollah would risk isolating the country and subjecting it to U.S. sanctions.POTENTIAL INSTABILITYAlready, Lebanon\'s Hezbollah has been targeted by U.S. sanctions aimed to block the flow of money to the group, a move that threatened to cause major damage to the country\'s solid banking sector if passed into law. Washington considers Hezbollah to be a terrorist organization and U.S. lawmakers called it Iran\'s leading "terrorist proxy."With Israel, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. seeing eye to eye on the need to stem Iran\'s growing clout, many fear Lebanon may be the place for a showdown with Iran\'s ally, Hezbollah.Israel and Hezbollah have fought a number of wars, the last of which ended in a stalemate in 2006. Israel has recently said it will not tolerate an Iranian presence in Syria, spearheaded by Hezbollah, which has also established a presence near the Syria-Israel border.___Associated Press writer Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.', 'Wresting Golda Meir From the Shadows - The New York TimesLIONESS Golda Meir and the Nation of Israel By Francine Klagsbrun Illustrated. 824 pp. Schocken. $40.In late September 1973, Israel’s Labor Party made its final campaign pitch for the upcoming elections. It placed ads in all the newspapers with a picture of its leader, the admired and beloved prime minister, Golda Meir, surrounded by reassuring words: “Quiet reigns on the banks of the Suez. The lines are secure; the bridges are open; Jerusalem is united.”Days later, on Yom Kippur, Syria and Egypt launched a massive pincer attack from north and south, their advancing tanks crushing the illusions of a complacent nation and forever shifting public opinion away from Meir. Despite hard-fought victories in both the war and the postponed vote, she resigned four months after re-election, condemned as a woman out of her depth (emphasis on “woman”). She died in 1978. And while American Jews remember her with pride and fondness (she spent her girlhood in Milwaukee and spoke a disarming Midwestern English of pinched nasal vowels), Meir has remained an object of some scorn in Israel. Her miscalculation contributed to the deaths of thousands. Her dismissal of the Palestinian nation (“no such thing as Palestinians,” she notoriously said) has won her few admirers on the left.But perspectives have begun to shift with the passage of time. As 2018 approaches — the 120th anniversary of Meir’s birth — we are in the midst of a re-evaluation of her legacy that places the 1973 disaster into a broader context of a life of rich accomplishment. In that emerging view, her failure to anticipate the attack must be understood as a reflection of the thinking of her security establishment; her leadership during the war was forceful. Last year, the Israeli state archives published a 700-page volume of her notes and documents with scholarly comment that reflects such revisionism. A grandson of Meir’s has recently started a foundation in her name to spread the word and to mark the anniversary. Events are planned both in Israel and the United States.To this growing Golda rethink, Francine Klagsbrun has contributed a thorough and absorbing examination of the woman and her role in Zionism and Israel. “Lioness” wrests Meir from the shadow of the Yom Kippur War and presents her life and career as a lens to examine Israel’s challenges — borders, settlements, occupation, terror and the social and ethnic divide between Jews of European and those of Middle Eastern origin. The author of more than a dozen books, many on Jewish subjects, and an essayist for The Jewish Week, Klagsbrun has spent years reviewing thousands of pages of documents, interviewing those closest to Meir (most now dead) and, while writing with affection, applying the tools of a contemporary truth tester (no, Meir never witnessed a pogrom as a small child in Kiev despite often invoking memories of one; and no, despite a Broadway play and a book by Seymour Hersh, Meir didn’t threaten to unleash nuclear weapons in the 1973 war if Nixon didn’t airlift needed supplies).In many ways, as Klagsbrun’s narrative makes clear, Meir was the archetypal Zionist. An Eastern European Jew who, after a lengthy American detour, immigrated to Palestine in 1921, Meir embodied the movement’s socialist and egalitarian modesty as well as its tough-minded militarism. She was what the Israelis call a bitzuist — a doer. She not only raised millions of dollars for Zionism and Israel but also fought to save European Jews from the Nazis, carried out clandestine visits to Jordan’s King Abdullah and, as labor minister, built tens of thousands of homes for new immigrants. Born Golda Mabovitch in the humblest of origins (her father’s inability to earn an income kept the family in penury for years), Meir quickly stood out once she landed in America with her family, embraced the Zionist movement and rose through relentless focus and networking.But, of course, Meir was highly atypical for a simple reason: She was a woman. When she was named foreign minister in the 1950s, she was the only woman in the world to hold that job. When she became prime minister in 1969, she was one of three women in such a post but the other two — Indira Gandhi of India and Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Ceylon — came to their roles following the death of a father and a husband.Everything about how Meir dealt with her gender is fascinating, telling and often somewhat tragic. She suffered from it but was not above exploiting it (“Call me Golda,” she disarmingly told everyone). Just as Barack Obama studiously avoided being seen as a black president, Meir stayed far away from both femininity and feminism. She wore no makeup, smoked like a chimney and, although she began her political rise through the Zionist women’s associations in the late 1920s, she claimed later never to have belonged to a women’s organization. Nixon said of Indira Gandhi that she acted “with the ruthlessness of a man but wanted always to be treated like a woman,” whereas Meir “acted like a man and wanted to be treated like a man.” Ben-Gurion referred to Golda as “the only man in the cabinet.”There is every reason to see all the manliness pretense as a survival mechanism, pure and simple. There was no model for an ambitious female politician and Meir was not about to devote time to inventing one.Meir married her American boyfriend Morris Meyerson, a dreamy lover of music and poetry who (like her father) never earned much of a living, never really wanted to move to Palestine and pretty much never saw his wife. The marriage collapsed as Golda took lovers from among her political colleagues (and she later took the Israeli name “Meir”). Their son and daughter were badly neglected as she spent months at a time abroad on fund-raising and diplomatic missions and, when home, stayed at meetings late into the night. Despite suffering personally from societal indifference toward working mothers, Meir never made the issue her own. She was vicious to Shulamit Aloni, an Israeli feminist and civil rights lawyer, a rising power within Labor whom she forced out. In the 1970s, when feminists began to exert influence globally, she dismissed them as “crazy women who burn their bras and … hate men.”Klagsbrun presents all this as part of the broad sweep of Meir’s life but the topic is ripe for deeper exploration. As part of the renaissance in Meir scholarship, others are taking a closer look at her specifically as a woman leader. (Pnina Lahav, a law professor at Boston University, is deep into a book that analyzes Meir as a victim of sexist mores, a trailblazer and a role model.)Golda Meir was prime minister of Israel when the Palestinian movement became enamored of terrorism, hijacking planes and kidnapping Israeli Olympic athletes. She had no patience for talk of a Palestinian state other than Jordan. “There will be no third state in the area,” she said. While that put her at odds with most thinking in the recent past, she would feel at home with the political debate in Israel today, where talk of a Palestinian state is fading fast. That may not bring the world any closer to peace in the Holy Land. But it will probably aid in Meir’s rehabilitation.', 'KFAR SABA, Israel – Eliahu Pietruszka shuffled his 102-year-old body through the lobby of his retirement home toward a stranger he had never met and collapsed into him in a teary embrace. Then he kissed both cheeks of his visitor and in a frail, squeaky voice began blurting out greetings in Russian, a language he hadn\'t spoken in decades.Only days earlier, the Holocaust survivor who fled Poland at the beginning of World War II and thought his entire family had perished learned that a younger brother had also survived, and his brother\'s son, 66-year-old Alexandre, was flying in from a remote part of Russia to see him.The emotional meeting was made possible by Israel\'s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial\'s comprehensive online database of Holocaust victims."It makes me so happy that at least one remnant remains from my brother, and that is his son," said Pietruszka, tears welling in his eyes. "After so many years I have been granted the privilege to meet him."Pietruszka was 24 when he fled Warsaw in 1939 as World War II erupted, heading to the Soviet Union and leaving behind his parents and twin brothers Volf and Zelig, who were nine years younger. His parents and Zelig were deported from the Warsaw Ghetto and killed in a Nazi death camp, but Volf also managed to escape. The brothers briefly corresponded before Volf was sent by the Russians to a Siberian work camp, where Pietruszka assumed he had died."In my heart, I thought he was no longer alive," Pietruszka said. He married in Russia and, thinking he had no family left, migrated to Israel in 1949 to start a new one.Then two weeks ago, his grandson, Shakhar Smorodinsky, received an email from a cousin in Canada who was working on her family tree. She said she had uncovered a Yad Vashem page of testimony filled out in 2005 by Volf Pietruszka for his older brother Eliahu, who he thought had died.Volf, it turned out, had survived and settled in Magnitogorsk, an industrial city in the Ural Mountains. Smorodinsky tracked down an address and reached out to discover that Volf, who had spent his life as a construction worker, had died in 2011 but that Alexandre, his only child, still lived there. After Smorodinsky arranged a brief Skype chat, Alexandre decided to come see the uncle he never knew he had.Smorodinsky, a 47-year-old professor from Ben-Gurion University in southern Israel, invited The Associated Press to record Thursday evening\'s reunion at his grandfather\'s retirement home in central Israel.Upon meeting, the two men clutched each other tightly and chatted in Russian as they examined each other\'s similar facial features."You are a copy of your father," said a shaking Pietruszka, who has a hearing aid and gets around in a rolling walker. "I haven\'t slept in two nights waiting for you."Throughout the meeting, Alexandre swallowed hard to hold back years, repeatedly shaking his head in disbelief."It\'s a miracle. I never thought this would happen," Alexandre, himself a retired construction worker, kept saying.It did, thanks to the Yad Vasham database of pages of testimony, whose goal is to gather and commemorate the names of all of the estimated 6 million Jewish victims of the Nazi genocide. The Names Recovery Project has been Yad Vashem\'s flagship mission in recent years. The memorials very name — Yad Vashem is Hebrew for "a memorial and a name" — alludes to its central mission of commemorating the dead as individuals, rather than mere numbers like the Nazis did.It hasn\'t been an easy task. The project began in 1954, but over the following half century, fewer than 3 million names were collected, mostly because the project was not widely known and many survivors refrained from reopening wounds, or clung to hopes that their relatives might still be alive.The names collected are commemorated in the museum\'s Hall of Names, a cone-shaped room whose walls are lined with bookshelves containing folders upon folders of testimonies. Still, until 2004, more than half of the allotted folders remained empty.That year, the database went online and provided immediate easy access to information in English, Hebrew, Russian, Spanish and German. Thanks to a high-profile campaign, and the efforts of Yad Vashem officials who have gone door-to-door to interview elderly survivors, the number has surged to 4.7 million names.Another rewarding byproduct has been that of tech-savvy grandchildren using it to research their families, leading to emotional reunions between various degrees of relatives from around the world.The rate of reunions has trickled significantly in recent years as elderly survivors have passed away, making each one increasingly significant, said Alexander Avram, the director of the database."It is not too late to fill out pages of testimony. We need to document each and every victim of the Holocaust," he said. "But such a reunion is a very special moment because we are not going to see a lot more of them in the future."Debbie Berman, a Yad Vashem official at the reunion, said it was incredibly moving to be there for "the end of an era.""This is one of the last opportunities that we will have to witness something like this. I feel like we are kind of touching a piece of history," she said.For Pietruszka, a retired microbiologist and great-grandfather of 10, it was a fulfilling coda to a long, eventful life."I am overjoyed," he said. "This shows it is never too late. People can always find what they are looking for if they try hard enough. I succeeded."____Follow Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap .', "University of California at Berkeley has an eight-week delay on 'high profile' campus speakers. Legal scholar Alan Dershowitz believes that may be a violation of first amendment rights and may sue over his right to speak. #TuckerThe editors of the student newspaper at the University of California at Berkeley have apologized after publishing a cartoon of famed Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz.The drawing drew stark criticism -- both from UC Berkeley's chancellor and from Dershowitz himself, who said the cartoon was anti-Semitic.The cartoon was a reaction to Dershowitz's talk earlier this month at UC Berkeley, where he defended the state of Israel. Prior the talk, he accused the university's students of “content-based discrimination” that almost prevented him from speaking at the home of the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s.Editorial Cartoon | Behind the scenes https://t.co/uO0B0PJ6V5Some on campus had opposed Dershowitz's appearance by drawing a swastika on a poster of Dershowitz’s face the day after the talk. The university condemned the act and suggested expressing disagreement in a more appropriate manner. It remained unclear who vandalized the poster.A week later, the student-run Daily Californian newspaper published a cartoon featuring Dershowitz that closely resembled Nazi-era anti-Semitic cartoons, prompting condemnations across social media and from top university officials.“Your recent editorial cartoon targeting Alan Dershowitz was offensive, appalling and deeply disappointing. I condemn its publication,” UC Berkeley President Carol Christ wrote in a letter to the newspaper’s editor.“Are you aware that its anti-Semitic imagery connects directly to the centuries-old ‘blood libel’ that falsely accused Jews of engaging in ritual murder? I cannot recall anything similar in the Daily Californian, and I call on the paper’s editors to reflect on whether they would sanction a similar assault on other ethnic or religious groups,” she added.This was posted at the Law School at @UCBerkeley where I spoke yesterday. A swastika is drawn over my face. pic.twitter.com/ILGWIZOc0QThe Harvard professor also slammed the cartoon, saying the incident shows that “there is very little difference between the Nazis of the hard right and the anti-Semites of the hard left.”“It is shocking that this vile depiction was published in Berkeley’s paper of record. The cartoon resembles the grotesque anti-Semitic blood libel propaganda splashed across Der Stürmer in the 1930s, which depicted Jews drinking the blood of gentile children,” Dershowitz wrote in the Daily Californian.Under pressure, the newspaper apologized for “the pain and anger” caused by the cartoon, adding that the artist’s intention was to suggest the professor’s talk on Israel was “hypocritical.”“We regret that the artistic rendering distracted from the discussion the artist was trying to start,” the apology read.The cartoon has not been removed from the newspaper's website.", 'WASHINGTON – When President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that Iran had "just test-fired" a missile, he seemed to know something the rest of the government did not. Turns out, he did not.There was no Iranian ballistic missile launch, three U.S. officials said Tuesday.Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard had used a military parade on Friday to display its Khoramshahr medium-range ballistic missile, which is capable of reaching Israel and much of the Middle East. That same day, video of the test firing of a Khoramshahr aired on Iranian state TV. The time or location of the test was not mentioned in the report, and it appears that the video footage was from a failed Iranian missile test earlier this year.It\'s unclear where Trump got his information, but it apparently did not come from U.S. intelligence agencies, which keep a continuous lookout for missile launches around the globe. As president, Trump could easily have checked with the CIA or other intelligence agencies to verify whether Iran had actually test-fired a missile.In his tweet he renewed his criticism of the nuclear agreement reached with Iran during the Obama administration."Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel," he wrote. "They are also working with North Korea. Not much of an agreement we have!"The nuclear agreement is designed to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb but does not prohibit it from developing missiles.Among the three officials who said there was no Iranian missile launch last week, one said officials who work on Iran issues were caught off guard by Trump\'s tweet. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an intelligence issue.Trump has suggested he might seek to renegotiate the nuclear deal or abandon it. He told the U.N. General Assembly last week that the accord was "nothing short of an embarrassment" and the "worst one-sided deal perhaps in American history."Officials have said Trump might use the Oct. 15 deadline for certifying to Congress whether Iran is in compliance with the nuclear deal to either declare Iran in violation or determine that the agreement is no longer in the national security interest of the U.S.Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday that Iran is adhering to its obligations under the nuclear agreement, known officially as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. He stressed that his concern is about Iran\'s behavior in other areas, such as its development of ballistic missiles and its support for extremist groups.Dunford declined to say publicly what advice he has given Trump on whether to recertify Iran\'s compliance with the nuclear deal.', 'RAFAH, Gaza Strip – Gaza\'s border crossing into Egypt ran Saturday under the Palestinian Authority\'s control for the first time in a decade, in a step forward for the Western-backed leadership\'s resuming of its functions in the Gaza Strip.Egypt opened the Rafah crossing point for three days on a humanitarian basis for the first time since the militant Hamas group ceded control of Gaza\'s crossings with Israel and Egypt to the West Bank-based PA. In 2007, Hamas wrested control of Gaza by force after winning legislative elections a year earlier, provoking an Israeli-Egyptian blockade that severely restricted the movement of most of Gaza\'s 2 million inhabitants.Hamas has wielded absolute power in Gaza since, driving its humanitarian conditions to near-total collapse. On Nov. 1, it withdrew from the crossings to implement the first step of an Egyptian-brokered deal to end the rift with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas\' Fatah party. Talks are to resume in Cairo this month to discuss the PA\'s expansion of its rule in Gaza and broader national issues.The three-day opening was aimed toward reducing the number of people stranded on both sides, nearly 80 days since Gaza\'s prime crossing was last open. No agreement has been reached to run the crossing on a regular basis. The PA wants to reactivate a 2005 U.S.-backed protocol stipulating that PA forces and EU monitors run the crossing. Hamas rejects the deal since it also gives Israel partial control via video cameras.Hamas says 30,000 people have been waiting for a chance to travel. Thus far, Rafah has opened for people exiting Gaza only 17 days this year.Rania Arada, 21, came to visit her family in Gaza a year ago when she was pregnant, hoping to stay for a month. Today, her daughter is eight months and has yet to see her Egyptian father. "Her father is very sad. I\'m also sad that he was not by my side when I gave birth," she said, waiting for a bus Saturday.Another woman, 19-year-old Suhad Rizek, said she hoped she could get through to attend the Egyptian university she had enrolled in to study medicine.

But that is far from the only unusual thing about Jerusalem.Here is a look at some of the extraordinary facts about the city that Israel claims as its capital, even though nearly 40 percent of its population are not Israeli citizens:HOLY HALLELUJAHJerusalem is home to key holy sites for the world\'s three monotheistic religions — concentrated in the Old City. The densely packed area, less than one square kilometer (one-third of a square mile), hosts the Western Wall and the adjacent hilltop compound revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, the spot where the biblical Temples once stood and the holiest site in Judaism. Palestinians revere the same hilltop compound as the Noble Sanctuary, Islam\'s third-holiest site, where the Al Aqsa Mosque and gold-topped Dome of the Rock are located. Nearby is the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which Christians revere as the spot where Jesus was crucified, buried and resurrected. Adding to the mix, Jordan, the former ruler of the Old City, retains custodial rights over Muslim holy sites, while Morocco and Saudi Arabia also claim to be their protectors. This tiny area may be the world\'s most combustible piece of real estate.CAPITAL WITHOUT CITIZENSJerusalem has long served as Israel\'s capital, hosting all major branches of government, even if not formally recognized by the international community. Yet nearly all of Jerusalem\'s 330,000 Palestinians — about 37 percent of the city\'s population — are not Israeli citizens, according to figures from the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research. Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and granted Palestinians "residency" rights that allow them to work and move about, without the right to vote in national elections. Palestinians living in Jerusalem aren\'t citizens of any country and travel abroad using temporary documents issued by Israel or Jordan. While eligible to apply for citizenship, few Palestinians have, fearing it would amount to recognition of Israel\'s control. Those who do apply complain of a lengthy bureaucratic process that can take years.LOOK TO THE EASTAlthough Israel considers Jerusalem to be its undivided capital, most of the city\'s territory lies in east Jerusalem, land considered occupied by the rest of the world. The city nearly tripled in size after it captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, then annexed the area and expanded the municipal boundaries to include open space and neighboring Palestinian villages. About 60 percent of the city\'s residents now live in east Jerusalem. That includes over 200,000 Jewish Israelis living in areas that Israel calls neighborhoods and much of the world considers illegal settlements. Hard-line members of the Israeli government are currently pushing proposals to annex neighboring West Bank settlements and rid the city of outlying Palestinian neighborhoods that lie outside a separation barrier as part of a plan to strengthen the city\'s Jewish majority.POOR JERUSALEMJerusalem is Israel\'s largest city. It is also the poorest, largely due to its high number of Arabs and ultra-Orthodox Jews. According to the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, 47 percent of its residents and 58 percent of its children lived under the poverty line in 2015. Ultra-Orthodox schools face criticism for not teaching important skills, such as math and English, while Palestinian areas suffer from neglect and a low number of women entering the work force. Most of the driving force behind Israel\'s economic engine is based in the central area of Tel Aviv, and many young Jewish Jerusalemites flock there for jobs in the booming financial and high-tech sectors. Jerusalem is home to the top-notch Hebrew University, but many of its students migrate to Tel Aviv after graduating.

But that is far from the only unusual thing about Jerusalem.Here is a look at some of the extraordinary facts about the city that Israel claims as its capital, even though nearly 40 percent of its population are not Israeli citizens:___HOLY HALLELUJAHJerusalem is home to key holy sites for the world\'s three monotheistic religions — concentrated in the Old City. The densely packed area, less than one square kilometer (one-third of a square mile), hosts the Western Wall and the adjacent hilltop compound revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, the spot where the biblical Temples once stood and the holiest site in Judaism. Palestinians revere the same hilltop compound as the Noble Sanctuary, Islam\'s third-holiest site, where the Al Aqsa Mosque and gold-topped Dome of the Rock are located. Nearby is the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which Christians revere as the spot where Jesus was crucified, buried and resurrected. Adding to the mix, Jordan, the former ruler of the Old City, retains custodial rights over Muslim holy sites, while Morocco and Saudi Arabia also claim to be their protectors. This tiny area may be the world\'s most combustible piece of real estate.___CAPITAL WITHOUT CITIZENSJerusalem has long served as Israel\'s capital, hosting all major branches of government, even if not formally recognized by the international community. Yet nearly all of Jerusalem\'s 330,000 Palestinians — about 37 percent of the city\'s population — are not Israeli citizens, according to figures from the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research. Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and granted Palestinians "residency" rights that allow them to work and move about, without the right to vote in national elections. Palestinians living in Jerusalem aren\'t citizens of any country and travel abroad using temporary documents issued by Israel or Jordan. While eligible to apply for citizenship, few Palestinians have, fearing it would amount to recognition of Israel\'s control. Those who do apply complain of a lengthy bureaucratic process that can take years.___LOOK TO THE EASTAlthough Israel considers Jerusalem to be its undivided capital, most of the city\'s territory lies in east Jerusalem, land considered occupied by the rest of the world. The city nearly tripled in size after it captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, then annexed the area and expanded the municipal boundaries to include open space and neighboring Palestinian villages. About 60 percent of the city\'s residents now live in east Jerusalem. That includes over 200,000 Jewish Israelis living in areas that Israel calls neighborhoods and much of the world considers illegal settlements. Hard-line members of the Israeli government are currently pushing proposals to annex neighboring West Bank settlements and rid the city of outlying Palestinian neighborhoods that lie outside a separation barrier as part of a plan to strengthen the city\'s Jewish majority.___POOR JERUSALEMJerusalem is Israel\'s largest city. It is also the poorest, largely due to its high number of Arabs and ultra-Orthodox Jews. According to the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, 47 percent of its residents and 58 percent of its children lived under the poverty line in 2015. Ultra-Orthodox schools face criticism for not teaching important skills, such as math and English, while Palestinian areas suffer from neglect and a low number of women entering the work force. Most of the driving force behind Israel\'s economic engine is based in the central area of Tel Aviv, and many young Jewish Jerusalemites flock there for jobs in the booming financial and high-tech sectors. Jerusalem is home to the top-notch Hebrew University, but many of its students migrate to Tel Aviv after graduating. In addition, many families leave the city because of its high housing costs.___GHOST CITYIn contrast to the vibrant coastal scene in Tel Aviv, many parts of the far more conservative Jerusalem largely come to a standstill on the Jewish Sabbath.

He also assailed Iran’s Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, the Shiite militia and political party that is part of the national unity cabinet he led.“Wherever Iran settles, it sows discord, devastation and destruction, proven by its interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries,” Mr. Hariri said, adding that Iran’s “hands” in the region “will be cut off.”The surprise announcement — which shocked even his own staff — was an ominous sign of the escalating regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, analysts said, indicating the growing dominance of Iran and Hezbollah as well as the Saudis’ increasingly assertive response.Lebanese and regional analysts, whether supporters or opponents of Hezbollah, said it appeared that Mr. Hariri had been pressured to resign by his patrons, the Saudis, as they and the United States ratchet up efforts to counter Iranian influence. The resignation came after weeks of sharp American and Saudi condemnations of Iran, including from President Trump, and new American sanctions against Hezbollah.By pushing out Mr. Hariri, analysts said, Saudi Arabia could deny Hezbollah a credible Sunni governing partner — an attempt to isolate it and deny it the fig leaf of a national unity government.“They concluded that Hariri was serving as more of a cover for Iranian and Hezbollah influence than as a counterweight to them,” said Rob Malley, a former special Middle East adviser to President Barack Obama and the vice president of the International Crisis Group.Yet the resignation also shows how few options Iran’s opponents have. Without Mr. Hariri in power, the United States and Saudi Arabia lose their main partner in the Lebanese government.Across the political spectrum, analysts and officials said the resignation ushered in new dangers. If the next government is more pro-Hezbollah, they said, that could lead to devastating sanctions. It could even increase the chances of a new war with Israel, which would see added justification for its argument that there is little distinction between Hezbollah and the Lebanese state.Mr. Hariri even raised the specter of internal violence. He compared the atmosphere in Lebanon now to the days before the 2005 assassination of his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying he believed his own life was in danger. “I sensed what’s being woven in secret to target my life,” he said.Mr. Hariri’s father was killed when his motorcade was bombed on Beirut’s seafront. Several Hezbollah members are being tried in absentia in a special United Nations-backed tribunal in The Hague, although the militant group has denied involvement in the assassination.Saad Hariri became prime minister in late 2016, in a compromise deal after Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, became president, ending a two-and-a-half-year political deadlock.Lebanon, which is governed by a sect-based political system, has long been deeply divided between a bloc aligned with Shiite Hezbollah and Iran, and one aligned with Saudi Arabia, the dominant Sunni country in the region.Mr. Hariri headed a 30-member national unity cabinet that was crafted to protect the country from any spillover from the multisided war in neighboring Syria, where Iran backed the government and Saudi Arabia backed the insurgents.That mission has largely been successful, even though Hezbollah has sided with the Syrian government, Lebanese Sunni militants have joined insurgents there, and well over one million refugees flooded this small Mediterranean country.In Lebanon’s political system, power is divided between a prime minister, who must be Sunni; a president, who must be Maronite Christian; and a speaker of Parliament, who must be Shiite.The exercise of real power in the country is a more complicated affair of alliances, rivalries and division of spoils between the leaders of sectarian groups, including former warlords from Lebanon’s civil war.Hezbollah, which rose to prominence fighting the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon, is the strongest because of its powerful militia, which can act independently of the state and in recent years has served as an expeditionary force across Syria.In recent years Lebanon’s rival blocs have essentially agreed to confine their fight to Syria. But tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have only increased.In addition to Hezbollah’s decisive role in helping President Bashar al-Assad of Syria hold on to power, Iran has supported several militias in Iraq that have managed to defeat Islamic State forces in that country and remain a fighting force.Iranian leaders say their interference is needed to stop terrorism, and to create a security zone for their country. The country’s influence started to rise after the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq in 2011, leaving behind an incomplete army and a pro-Iranian government.Iran’s filling of the vacuum created by the departure of the United States military has been an extremely worrying development for Saudi Arabia and some other Arab states, who have seen their efforts to fight proxy wars with Iran largely fail.And now that the Syrian war seems to be entering a new phase, with Mr. Assad still ruling a devastated country, there are fears that tensions that had been pushed to the back burner — inside Lebanon, between Hezbollah and Israel, and elsewhere — could re-emerge.The United States has stepped up sanctions on Hezbollah in recent weeks after President Trump criticized Iran and the landmark nuclear deal it reached under Mr. Obama.“It signals a new phase of escalation,” said Ali Rizk, a pro-Hezbollah Lebanese analyst, adding that after the Islamic State is defeated, the United States will put new pressure on what it sees as Shiite extremists. “Lebanon is in for a hard time,” Mr. Rizk said.The resignation brought sharp words from Israel and Iran. Bahram Ghasemi, a spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, said Mr. Hariri’s speech was driven by a Saudi, American and Israeli effort aimed at “creating tension in Lebanon and the region.”And in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the resignation “a wake-up call for the international community to take action against the Iranian aggression.”The pressure now is on the Lebanese president, Mr. Aoun, who will hold consultations with Parliament about appointing a caretaker government, said Imad Salamey, an analyst at the Lebanese American University in Beirut.“If he indeed is going to bring in a pro-Hezbollah government, then he has to face the consequences,” such as new sanctions, Mr. Salamey said. “It will be a massive U.S. and Saudi response. The economy will collapse for sure.”In his speech, Mr. Hariri said he wanted to unite Lebanon and free it from outside influence. He pronounced himself “full of optimism and hope that Lebanon will be stronger, free, independent, with no authority over it except that of its own great people.”But in the streets of Tariq al-Jdeedeh, a mostly Sunni neighborhood of Beirut that is part of Mr. Hariri’s political base, anger and confusion contrasted with the posters of Mr. Hariri that festooned the buildings.“Hariri didn’t do this for Lebanon, he did this for Saudi against Iran,” said Nabil Idriss, who was tending his son’s fabric shop. “Now with this move, the picture is more transparent than ever. Saad Hariri was never in control.”', '                                    Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri slammed Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group for meddling in Arab affairs and says "Iran\'s arms in the region will be cut off."

In his speech, he suggested he feared for his life and said the atmosphere in the country is similar to the one that existed before his father, the late prime minister Rafik Hariri, was assassinated in 2005.', 'Palestinians Clash With Israeli Troops to Protest Trump’s Jerusalem Declaration - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — Palestinians clashed with Israeli forces in the West Bank and along the border with Gaza on Thursday, as widespread predictions of unrest were realized a day after President Trump took the high-risk move of recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.Hundreds of youths clashed with Israeli forces at checkpoints. In Gaza, youths protested along the border fence, rallied in a central Gaza City park and burned tires in a refugee camp. Dozens were injured, at least one seriously.After nightfall, two rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza. The Israeli military said they had fallen short and landed inside the Palestinian coastal territory.The Israeli military said it was sending additional battalions to the West Bank in response to the protests.Mr. Trump’s decision ignited other protests across the region, from the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon to Tunisia. Hundreds of Jordanians protested outside the United States Embassy in Amman and called for its closing, chanting, “America is the head of the snake.” At a news conference in Baghdad, Moqtada al-Sadr, an influential Iraqi Shiite cleric, called for a unified “Arab Spring” against Israel. Jihadist groups from Somalia to Syria and from Yemen to Afghanistan issued venomous statements about Mr. Trump’s decision.In Palestinian areas, schools were closed, stores were shuttered and the public largely observed a general strike. The mood in the streets of downtown East Jerusalem, where there was a heavy Israeli police presence, was tense and sullen.In Gaza, Ismail Haniya, the leader of Hamas, the Islamic militant group, called for a new intifada, or uprising, saying, “Trump will regret this decision.”The Palestinians have undertaken two major uprisings since the late 1990s, leading to hundreds of deaths on both sides, but many Palestinians say they ultimately did little to advance their cause.Mr. Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem, which upended longstanding American policy and broke with international consensus, continued to draw condemnation from Arab and European leaders.Critics have argued that unilaterally recognizing Israel’s claim to the city prejudged the outcome of any negotiations for a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinians aspire for an independent state with East Jerusalem, which has holy sites sacred to Christians, Jews and Muslims, as its capital.Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, and other officials in the West Bank said the United States had disqualified itself from any mediating role.Mr. Abbas has repeatedly stated that he does not want a third intifada on his watch. His Fatah party has called for nonviolent protests in the West Bank.Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s top foreign policy official, warned that the decision would be damaging to the peace effort.“President Trump’s announcement on Jerusalem has a very worrying potential impact,” she said. “It has a very fragile context and the announcement has the potential to send us backwards to even darker times than the ones we are already living in.”In Beirut, Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese militant organization Hezbollah, called for governments to withdraw their ambassadors from Tel Aviv and take other steps that go beyond making statements.The American secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, said in Vienna that the United States was still committed to the peace process and that a two-state solution to resolve the conflict was still viable.“All of Israel’s government offices are largely in Jerusalem already, so the U.S. is just recognizing the reality of that,” he said in response to a question at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. “This does not in any way finalize the status of Jerusalem, that’s still left to the parties to discuss,” he added.An important test will come on Friday. Hamas, the dominant force in Gaza, appeared to be competing with the West Bank leadership over loyalty to Jerusalem, and has called for Palestinians to rally and to confront the Israeli forces wherever possible after noon prayers.Mr. Abbas’s Palestinian Authority and Hamas are engaged in a renewed reconciliation effort after a decade-long schism. In the midst of the turmoil over Jerusalem, the authority’s prime minister, Rami Hamdallah, arrived in Gaza on Thursday to discuss the handover of internal security there, one of the main sticking points that have bedeviled previous attempts to ease tensions.Mr. Hamdallah told reporters in Gaza that his side was devoted to reconciliation, “but if we fail, we will rise again to face together the biggest challenge: the Israeli occupation.”There were few visible signs of celebration among Israelis; for many, Mr. Trump had only affirmed a longstanding reality.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the announcement from Washington. “President Trump has inscribed himself in the annals of our capital for all time,” he said at a conference at the Israeli Foreign Ministry. “His name will now be linked to the names of others in the context of the glorious history of Jerusalem and our people.”Mr. Netanyahu said Israel was in contact with other countries to persuade them to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, too. “It’s about time,” he said.In Gaza, Salwa Helis, 32, took a group of orphans she teaches to the demonstration in the Gaza City park, where they held Palestinian flags and banners against the backdrop of a large poster of Jerusalem, a city that is out of reach for most Gazans.“I can’t carry a weapon to shoot or launch rockets at Israelis,” she said. “That’s why I am here protesting against Trump’s resolution by shouting solidarity slogans for Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Palestine.”In the Jabaliya refugee camp north of Gaza City Rwaida Abuatia, 55, was egging on the protesters. “There should be no rockets under the ground,” she said, referring to the subterranean stocks. “They should all be launched against Israel.”', 'Trump Recognizes Jerusalem, and a Debate Breaks Out - The New York TimesTo the Editor:Re “President Calls Jerusalem Shift ‘the Right Thing’ ” (front page, Dec. 7):President Trump said all final status issues, like border issues in Jerusalem, remain open to negotiation between the parties. So he may not have actually denied that Jerusalem could be negotiated to be the capital of not only Israel but also Palestine: to be a shared capital.This could decrease the high emotion on all sides, and would seem the most important question to ask him about where United States policy stands today on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.JAMES ADLER, CAMBRIDGE, MASS.To the Editor:President Trump, in his speech about Jerusalem, called attention to President Harry S. Truman’s recognition of the state of Israel 70 years ago. But what Truman did not do was to recognize Jerusalem as its capital.Truman supported what we now call a two-state solution, a partition plan drawn up by the United Nations. Palestine would be divided into two separate states, one Jewish and one Arab. They would be tied together in an economic union.As for Jerusalem, an international zone would be established around the city to guarantee access by all faiths to their holy sites. Jews welcomed the partition. The Arabs did not. Truman believed that was a great missed historic opportunity.President Trump’s decision on Jerusalem will likely be seen as a great historic mistake, making a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians that much more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.KARL F.

There is another party whose wishes must be considered: the Palestinians.As Israelis know, though they may want to ignore it, this decision was to be made as an outcome of negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, who also claim Jerusalem as their capital. That’s what all previous American presidents and the rest of the world, as stated in many United Nations resolutions, understand.Of course President Trump doesn’t necessarily know or care about United Nations resolutions, any more than he knows or cares about the Constitution.EUGENE GLICKMAN, BROOKLYN', 'New Trailer: ‘7 Days in Entebbe’ - The New York TimesThe 1971 hit “I’d Love to Change the World” by Ten Years After plays under the new trailer for “7 Days in Entebbe.” But as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict rages on more than 40 years after the events depicted in the film, it seems the world hasn’t changed much.On June 27, 1976, hijackers commandeered an Air France flight from Israel to Paris and ultimately forced the plane with more than 200 aboard to land at Entebbe Airport in Uganda. The militants threatened to kill passengers unless Palestinian and other prisoners held in Israel and elsewhere were released. One week later, on the same day the United States celebrated its bicentennial, Israeli forces executed a mission rescuing most of the hostages. Among those killed were all of the hijackers as well as three hostages and one Israeli soldier, Jonathan “Yoni” Netanyahu, the older brother of Israel’s current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.Daniel Brühl and Rosamund Pike play members of a radical West German group who carried out the hijacking along with Palestinian revolutionaries. The cast also includes Eddie Marsan as Shimon Peres, Israel’s defense minister at the time and later its president and prime minister.Two quickly made TV movies with all-star casts, “Raid on Entebbe” and “Victory at Entebbe,” were broadcast several months after the events. “7 Days in Entebbe,” written by Gregory Burke (“’71”) and directed by José Padilha (“Narcos”), promises to take a more nuanced look at the story and will be released in theaters domestically on March 16.', "                                    FILE: Las Vegas Sands Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam Ochsorn.

Now What? - The New York TimesBEIRUT, Lebanon — After a bizarre three-week international sojourn during which he shocked his country by suddenly quitting the government, Saad Hariri, the prime minister of Lebanon, is back home and still in his job — at least for the time being.But while his return and the promise of political dialogue about the country’s future have temporarily pulled Lebanon back from the brink of a political void, the issues that set off the crisis remain as serious and intractable as they were before he left.This small country remains a battleground in the struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran for influence in the Middle East. It is also home to Hezbollah, the militant group that has grown into a regional force in its own right.Although Mr. Hariri has denied it, Lebanese politicians and foreign diplomats say that Saudi Arabia forced him to resign — and even considered replacing him with his brother — in the hope of inciting a change in the status quo that would weaken Hezbollah.That plan failed, in part because Saudi Arabia’s Western allies say they were caught off guard and pressured the Saudis to back down.Now Mr. Hariri is at home once again — and everyone is trying to figure out what comes next.“Where do we go from here?” said Nadim Munla, senior adviser to Mr. Hariri. “Everybody is monitoring Iran and Hezbollah, and I really believe that the ball is in their court.”Mr. Hariri’s strange trip underlines how vulnerable Lebanon remains to clashing regional and international agendas. In the country’s sect-based political system, most major parties rely on foreign powers for funding, with the expectation that the parties will then advance the interests of their international backers.Mr. Hariri has played that role for Saudi Arabia since taking it over from his father, Rafik Hariri, a former prime minister who was killed in a car-bomb attack in Beirut in 2005. Countries like the United States and France also support him, considering him a moderate, pro-Western leader.Hezbollah plays that role for Iran, which helped create it in the 1980s. Iran now relies on the militant group as a strategic threat against Israel and as an expeditionary military force in the Arab world, including in Syria.Besides their divergent views on Lebanon’s role in the world, there is bad blood between Mr. Hariri and Hezbollah.Mr. Hariri has criticized Hezbollah’s intervention in Syria, and some of its members have been indicted for involvement in his father’s killing. Hezbollah says it played no role.But a deal last year brought them together in a power-sharing government, with Mr. Hariri as prime minister and a Christian ally of Hezbollah, Michel Aoun, as president.That arrangement worked domestically. But as Saudi Arabia and its young, assertive crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, grew more alarmed about the activities of Iran and its allies in the region, they found it increasingly untenable that their Lebanese ally was heading a government with members of a group they consider a terrorist organization and security threat.Their pique came to a head on Nov. 4, when Mr. Hariri was summoned to Riyadh and forced to resign, according to foreign diplomats and politicians close to him. Hours later, Saudi officials said they had shot down a missile fired from Yemen as it neared the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Saudi officials blamed Hezbollah for helping Yemeni rebels, and Thamer Sabhan, the Saudi minister for Gulf affairs, accused Iran and Hezbollah of “an act of war” against Saudi Arabia.It remains unclear what the Saudis expected to happen next, but they had at least entertained the idea of replacing Mr. Hariri with his older brother, Bahaa, believing that he would take a harder line on Iran, according to foreign diplomats and Lebanese politicians.“It was part of saying that Hariri is not ready to do this, so let’s find someone who can,” said Alain Aoun, a member of Parliament from the president’s party.But the plan backfired, with politicians across the political spectrum and other members of Mr. Hariri’s family rejecting the idea that Saudi Arabia could swap out politicians as it pleased.“We are not herds of sheep, nor a plot of land whose ownership can be moved from one person to another,” Nouhad Machnouk, the interior minister and an ally of Mr. Hariri, told reporters this month.“In Lebanon, things happen though elections, not pledges of allegiances,” he said, in a jab at Saudi Arabia’s monarchical system.Western countries like the United States and France have worked to keep Lebanon stable, in part because it has taken in more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees, giving it the highest refugee count per capita of any country in the world.The Saudis had not informed their Western allies of their plans for Mr. Hariri, and officials in Paris and Washington were horrified when he announced his resignation.When Mr. Sabhan, the Saudi minister, arrived in Washington a few days later, officials at the State Department berated him for pushing a rash act they felt could destabilize Lebanon, American officials said.France intervened as well. President Emmanuel Macron invited Mr. Hariri to Paris and repeatedly called the Saudis to press them to let him leave.After stops in France, Egypt and Cyprus, Mr. Hariri landed in Beirut on Tuesday to a hero’s welcome. The next day, during a celebration of Lebanon’s Independence Day, he announced that he was holding off on his resignation to allow for dialogue with other political leaders.Any dialogue will have to address Hezbollah’s activities abroad, an issue that Lebanese politicians have avoided because they know they have little leverage over a military force much more powerful than the national army.Mr. Aoun, the member of Parliament, said that Mr. Hariri had returned stronger than before, thanks to an outpouring of support from Lebanon and its foreign allies.“He is coming back with a great opportunity,” Mr. Aoun said. “No one sees him as responsible for what happened. They see him as a victim of what happened.”He said that he expected the dialogue to focus on the idea that Lebanon should stay out of conflicts in the region. Hezbollah has flouted that by sending fighters and advisers to Syria, Iraq and Yemen.But the breadth of Hezbollah’s activities has lead many to conclude that addressing them is not Lebanon’s responsibility alone.“It is not through a Lebanese dialogue that we can address these issues,” Mr. Aoun said. “They need to be discussed internationally.”And the parties’ foreign backers may not give them much room to negotiate.In an interview published on Friday, Prince Mohammed of Saudi Arabia compared Iran’s supreme leader to Hitler and said that Mr. Hariri could not provide political cover for a government that the Saudis consider to be controlled by Hezbollah.The day before, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Mohammad Ali Jafari, stood up for Hezbollah, saying that it should have the best weapons to protect Lebanon.“This issue is nonnegotiable,” he said.Mr. Munla, Mr. Hariri’s adviser, said the coming negotiations would need to address Hezbollah’s regional role, but that it was unclear whether it or its Iranian patrons would be willing to give that up.“Given what we are hearing from them, one would wonder if they are willing to compromise,” he said.', 'At a Tumultuous Moment, Unesco Picks a New Leader - The New York TimesPARIS — A former culture minister from France was elected on Friday to lead Unesco, the United Nations educational and cultural agency, a decision that was overshadowed by the Trump administration’s decision a day earlier to withdraw the United States from the organization.The change of leadership comes at a tumultuous time for the agency, whose goals of promoting education and defending human rights have been hampered in recent years by a lack of funding and disputes between member states, which sometimes use the organization as a forum to settle political or historical scores.“It’s an institution that for a while now has lost the thread of its initial mission,” said Manuel Lafont Rapnouil, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Paris.Mr. Lafont Rapnouil, a former French diplomat who has worked on United Nations affairs, said that the organization was started to foster cultural and educational exchange as a way of contributing to world peace. Instead, he said, too often it has been used as a platform for countries to take largely symbolic jabs at other countries.The former culture minister, Audrey Azoulay, was elected by Unesco’s executive board, meeting at the organization’s Paris headquarters, to a four-year term. She defeated Hamad bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari, a Qatari diplomat.Ms. Azoulay received 30 of the board’s 58 votes, according to results posted online by Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s foreign minister, said in a statement congratulating Ms. Azoulay that Unesco was facing “historic challenges” and that France would work toward “a strong and responsible multilateralism.”The election on Friday ended a weeklong process that whittled down a field of nine candidates during several rounds of voting. Although the executive board’s nominee must be formally approved by Unesco’s 195 member states in November, that step is seen as a formality.Ms. Azoulay argued before the vote that she would strive to “restore” Unesco’s credibility and efficiency by focusing on its core missions. In the wake of the United States’ withdrawal, she said France had decided “not to leave it, but to get even more involved.”But she will lead at a difficult time for the agency.Unesco is best known for designating World Heritage sites, more than 1,000 of them since 1972, including ones like Yosemite National Park in California and the Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan. It is also known for its educational programs, and it works extensively on the promotion of sex education, literacy, clean water and equality for women.But it has suffered in recent years from a lack of funding as well as accusations of political bias, especially on matters related to the Israelis and Palestinians. Unesco member states have used the organization to rehash historical disputes, fight over competing claims to cultural heritage and challenge the international legitimacy of their rivals.Recent examples include China and India filing rival claims over Tibetan medicine; Japan withholding funding after documents on the 1937 Nanjing massacre in China were added to Unesco’s Memory of the World list; and Serbia fighting to prevent Kosovo from becoming a member.Regional rivalries were also on display during this week’s voting. Qatar, Egypt and Lebanon each fielded a candidate instead of uniting behind a common bid, even though Arab countries had long agreed that it was their turn to lead Unesco, which Westerners have directed repeatedly since its founding in 1945.Bickering between Qatar and Egypt underscored divisions in the Arab world linked to a dispute between Saudi Arabia and Qatar that has split the Persian Gulf region. Egypt has backed Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States in their feud with Qatar, which they accuse of financing terrorism and of cozying up to Iran.Qatar had lobbied extensively over the past two years for the Unesco position, and Mr. Kawari was seen as a favorite.Moushira Khattab, a diplomat who was Egypt’s candidate, was eliminated from the race earlier on Friday after a preliminary vote to decide whether she or Ms. Azoulay would move into the final round. Both had received 18 votes in the fourth round of voting on Thursday.The balloting for director general is secret, making it difficult to know how each member state on the board voted, but Ms. Azoulay, a latecomer to the race, might have benefited in the final round from the rivalry between Qatar and Egypt.Unesco’s difficulties were compounded on Thursday when the Trump administration announced that it would withdraw from the organization. The administration, which has repeatedly criticized United Nations agencies over the past months, cited anti-Israel bias and mounting arrears to explain the decision. Israel also said Thursday that it was taking steps to withdraw.The United States will withdraw by the end of next year, but will remain a nonmember observer at Unesco, according to American officials. The United States had already cut off all contributions to Unesco’s budget, in 2011, after Palestine was voted a full member, depriving the agency of nearly a fifth of its budget and forcing it to slash programs.The move by the United States was met with dismay in Europe, where many see the Trump administration as increasingly withdrawn from the rest of the world and reluctant to engage in multilateral discussions — most recently, for instance, with President Trump’s disavowal on Friday of the Iran nuclear deal.In its editorial on Friday, the French newspaper Le Monde wrote that Mr. Trump and the United States were “reaffirming their intention to turn their backs on the search for collective solutions.”“Despite all of its many shortcomings,” the newspaper wrote, Unesco has an important role to play “in a world beset by political and religious extremism, by conspiracy theories, and often by a calling into question of science.”Unesco’s current director general, Irina Bokova, a former diplomat from Bulgaria, was the first woman and first Eastern European to lead the organization. She was elected in 2009 and again in 2013.Ms. Azoulay, who was born into a Jewish Moroccan family, served for just over a year as culture minister under President François Hollande. Although she declared her candidacy before the election of the current president, Emmanuel Macron, the new government supported her bid.Mr. Lafont Rapnouil, the analyst, said that the first challenge for Ms. Azoulay would be to find common ground among Unesco’s member states to define the body’s key priorities in the coming years, a task he called “difficult.”“In a context where the United States and Israel are readying to leave, there is going to be an even more political and polarized dimension to the way Unesco is going to work,” he said.', '‘From One Crisis to the Next’: Brexit-Torn Britain Stumbles - The New York Times', 'BERLIN – Two suspected members of Adolf Hitler\'s mobile "Einsatzgruppen" death squads identified by the Simon Wiesenthal Center have been tracked down by German reporters but deny participating in wartime massacres.One suspect, 94-year-old Kurt Gosdek, told broadcaster ARD\'s Politikmagazin Kontraste program that he was part of a special SS unit in Einsatzgruppe C in Ukraine in 1941, but had worked behind the lines repairing vehicles.Herbert Wahler, 95, confirmed that his name was on the Einsatzgruppen roster, but refused other comment, according to transcripts of the interviews provided to The Associated Press ahead of Thursday night\'s broadcast.German prosecutors confirm the men are under investigation but say there\'s not enough evidence to charge them.The Wiesenthal Center gave authorities their names in 2014 and questioned why the investigations have taken so long.', 'In a Compromise, U.N. Rights Experts Will Examine Abuses in Yemen’s War - The New York TimesGENEVA — In a surprise compromise, the top United Nations human rights body decided on Friday to establish an international team of experts to examine abuses in the Yemen war and seek to identify those responsible.The decision capped an intense spate of diplomacy that spared Saudi Arabia, which has led a deadly bombing campaign in Yemen for more than two years, from a formal panel of inquiry like the one investigating the war in Syria.The 47-member Human Rights Council in Geneva adopted the decision by consensus after three weeks of day-and-night negotiations over one of its most fiercely contested resolutions.The final version calls for the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, to appoint “a group of eminent international and regional experts” to conduct a “comprehensive examination” of abuses by all parties to the conflict since September 2014.The experts will report to the high commissioner within a year and discuss their findings with the Human Rights Council in September next year.Mr. al-Hussein’s office in the meantime is to provide support to Yemen’s national commission as it investigates human rights abuses.The outcome, completed late Friday afternoon, reflected a compromise between two alliances of countries that had seemed set on a collision course.An alliance of mainly European countries led by the Netherlands had proposed the creation of an international commission of inquiry to investigate abuses in Yemen.They were opposed by a Saudi-led alliance, which supports Yemen’s exiled president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, against Iran-backed Houthi rebels and affiliated armed groups.Earlier in September, Mr. al-Hussein, for the third year in a row, had urged creation of an international investigation panel as his office released a report presenting a litany of abuses by all parties involved in the conflict in Yemen, which has caused thousands of civilian casualties and contributed to a staggering humanitarian crisis in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country.Saudi coalition airstrikes were the leading cause of civilian casualties, Mr. al-Hussein noted, scolding “the reticence of the international community in demanding justice for the victims of the conflict.”Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies called instead for the United Nations to provide international experts to support Yemen’s national commission — a position rejected by the other side because of that commission’s close relationship with the Saudis.An hour before the council reached its decision, senior Yemeni officials still were insisting that the Saudi demand would be the crux of any deal.The final agreement emerged from a compromise text drafted by diplomats from the United States, Britain and France on Thursday night and discussed by representatives from both groups at an early morning meeting in the United States mission in Geneva.Saudi Arabia and its allies avoided the embarrassment of a full-scale international commission of inquiry, and the text of the agreement omitted all language of investigation while pledging to support Yemen’s national commission on human rights.“The combination of international and national mechanisms is an excellent result for the promotion and protection of human rights,” the Saudi ambassador, Abdulaziz Alwasil, said as he headed into the council to seal the agreement.The Netherlands, after coming under intense pressure to soften it position, expressed confidence that it had preserved its main demand.“We have a fully-fledged international investigation,” Rochus Pronk, the Dutch diplomat who led negotiations for the Western group — even though the term “investigation” is not used.“I think it’s an incredible outcome,” Mr. Pronk said.Saudi Arabia had successfully blocked Dutch calls for an international inquiry into the war in Yemen last year. There were unconfirmed reports that the Saudis had threatened to retaliate against states that supported the Dutch position.But compromise was harder to avoid this year, diplomats said, partly because of the deterioration of conditions in Yemen, now described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis with seven million people verging on famine and a cholera epidemic that threatens to sicken nearly a million people by year’s end.Moreover, Yemen’s human rights commission, funded partly by Saudi Arabia, had proved unable in the last year to conduct comprehensive, impartial or transparent investigations, the United Nations said.Human rights groups regarded the compromise reached Friday as a qualified victory. “It’s a historic decision to put in place a mechanism that will bring scrutiny to all parties,” said John Fisher, director of Human Rights Watch’s Geneva office.Mona Sabella, an advocacy officer for the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, said: “Many thought it impossible to challenge Saudi impunity for war crimes in Yemen. The creation of an international investigative body today has shown that the lives of millions of Yemen people mean more than Saudi influence.”', 'Rebeccah Heinrichs of the Hudson Institute weighs in on \'America\'s News HQ\'President Trump accused Iran of collaborating with North Korea to strengthen their missile technology Saturday evening in a Twitter post criticizing the 2015 nuclear agreement between the U.S., Iran and five other nations."Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel," Trump wrote. "They are also working with North Korea. Not much of an agreement we have!"Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!Nonproliferation experts have long suspected North Korea and Iran are sharing know-how when it comes to their rogue missile programs. Earlier this month, CIA Director Mike Pompeo told Fox News\' "Special Report with Bret Baier" that Iran would "certainly be someone who would be willing to pay" for that expertise."The North Koreans have a long history of being proliferators and sharing their knowledge, their technology, their capacities around the world," Pompeo said. "As North Korea continues to improve its ability to do longer-range missiles and to put nuclear weapons on those missiles, it is very unlikely if they get that capability that they wouldn\'t share it with lots of folks."Trump posted the tweet hours after Iran claimed to have successfully tested a new ballistic missile capable of reaching parts of the Middle East, including Israel.The missile, known as the Khoramshahr, has a range of 1,250 miles and is based on a North Korean design. A similar missile was tested in late January and blew up 600 miles after launch.The Iranian test-launch constituted a direct challenge to Trump, who last month signed a bill imposing mandatory penalties on those involved in Iran\'s ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them.Trump has vowed repeatedly to take a tougher line toward Iran than his predecessor, threatening at various times to renegotiate or even dismantle the nuclear deal, and shoot Iranian boats out of the water if they provoke U.S. naval vessels in the Persian Gulf.On Wednesday, Trump told reporters that he had made a decision about whether or not to pull out of the nuclear deal, but declined to say what it was.Earlier this week, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani vowed Iran would strengthen its missile capabilities without asking for any country’s permission, just days after Trump accused Iran in an address to the United Nations General Assembly of exporting violence to Yemen, Syria, and other parts of the Middle East.In that speech, Trump criticized the nuclear deal as "one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.""Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States," the president proclaimed, "and I don’t think you’ve heard the last of it, believe me."The nuclear deal between Iran and world powers does not strictly prohibit Iran from developing missiles but after the deal came into effect last year, the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution calling on Iran not to take any actions related to ballistic missiles "designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons" for eight years.Iranian officials have argued that the measure only applies to missiles specifically designed to carry nuclear warheads.Fox News\' Lucas Tomlinson and the Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump plans to deliver a broad and harsh critique of Iran in a speech Friday declaring that the landmark Iran nuclear deal is not in America\'s national security interests, according to U.S. officials and outside advisers to the administration.Trump\'s speech from the White House will outline specific faults he finds in the 2015 accord but will also focus on an array of Iran\'s troubling non-nuclear activities, four officials and advisers said. Those include Tehran\'s ballistic missile program, support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon\'s Hezbollah movement and other groups that destabilize the region.Under U.S. law, Trump faces a Sunday deadline to notify Congress whether Iran is complying with the accord that was painstakingly negotiated over 18 months by the Obama administration and determine if it remains a national security priority. Although Trump intends to say Iran is living up to the letter of the agreement, he will make the case that the deal is fatally flawed and that its non-nuclear behavior violates the spirit of the regional stability it was intended to encourage, the officials and advisers said.The officials and advisers, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly preview the speech, said Trump will not call for a re-imposition of nuclear sanctions on Tehran. He will urge lawmakers to codify tough new requirements for Tehran to continue to benefit from the sanctions relief that it won in exchange for curbing its atomic program. And he\'ll announce his long-anticipated intent to impose sanctions on Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard Corps by designating it a terrorist organization under an existing executive order, according to the officials and advisers.In addition, Trump will ask Congress to amend or replace outright the legislation that currently requires him to certify Iranian compliance every 90 days. Officials have said that Trump hates the requirement more than the nuclear deal itself because it forces him to take a position on what he has denounced as the worst deal in American history every three months. That frequency has also irritated aides who have complained that they are spending inordinate amounts of time on certification at the expense other issues.At the White House, Trump\'s chief of staff, John Kelly, confirmed the president would announce the results of his Iran policy review on Friday but declined to offer any detail. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was calling foreign minister colleagues from the other parties to the deal to brief them on what to expect, the State Department said.But in a possible preview of Trump\'s announcement, CIA Director Mike Pompeo blasted Iran during a speech at the University of Texas, calling Iran\'s Ministry of Intelligence and Revolutionary Guard "cudgels of a despotic theocracy."The IRGC, which is responsible for external operations, is expanding its power across the Middle East, Pompeo said. "Unlike ISIS and its mirage of a caliphate, Iran is now a powerful nation-state that remains the world\'s largest state sponsor of terror."White House aides initially sought a venue for Trump\'s address that would project American power and determination. The shuttered former Iranian embassy in Washington was briefly considered before being deemed inappropriate. Officials also considered the Iwo Jima Marine Corps Memorial, which was ruled out because it is currently being renovated.American allies, who have pressed the White House to remain in the nuclear accord, will be closely watching the president\'s address. Trump wants to impress on the European parties to the accord — Germany, France and Britain — the importance of fixing what he sees as flaws in the nuclear accord and addressing malign behavior not covered in the agreement.The Europeans, along with the other parties, Iran, Russia and China, have ruled out reopening the deal. But some, notably France, have signaled a willingness to tackle unresolved issues in supplementary negotiations. Among those issues are the expiration of several restrictions on advanced nuclear activity under so-called "sunset clauses" that will allow Iran to begin ramping up its enrichment capabilities after 10 years, the end of an arms embargo and the eventual easing of demands for a halt to its missile program.In the speech, Trump hopes to "recruit" the Europeans into joining his broad strategy, particularly by punishing the Revolutionary Guard, which he and his national security team believe is fomenting instability, violence and extremism throughout the Middle East and beyond, according to one official.In anticipation of Trump\'s announcements, Republican legislators have drawn up new versions of the law replacing the current 90-day timetable with "semi-annual" certifications, according to two drafts seen by the Associated Press this week.Both drafts, one from Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker., and one from committee member and harsh deal critic Sen. Tom Cotton, expand the U.S. certification criteria to include items that are also the province of the U.N. nuclear watchdog and require the U.S. intelligence community to determine if Iran is carrying out illicit activity in facilities to which the International Atomic Energy Agency has not had access.The certification would also demand that the intelligence community produce judgments on Iranian behavior not covered by the nuclear deal, including missile testing and development, backing for Hezbollah and Assad and threats to Israel and the Mideast more broadly, according to the drafts.___Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.', '                                    The bodies of 60-year-old Orouba Barakat (l) and her daughter, 23-year-old journalist Halla Barakat (r), were discovered late Thursday after friends contacted police when the reporter didn\'t show up for work.

Homicide officers are investigating the deaths. The Hurriyet newspaper said police believe the women were killed two or three days ago.Officials for the U.S. State Department confirmed the deaths in a statement released on Friday afternoon.“The United States is deeply saddened by the deaths of Arouba and Hala Barakat,” State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in the statement, which had alternative spellings of their names. “Hala served as a journalist for Orient News and we remember the courageous work of her mother, Arouba, a Syrian activist who reported on the Syrian regime’s atrocities. The United States condemns the perpetrators of these murders and we will closely follow the investigation."There have been four previous killings of Syrian journalists in Turkey, which the Islamic State group has claimed. A fifth journalist survived two attacks.The two women were related to the Barakat family from Chapel Hill, N.C., whose three members were also killed in 2015 by their neighbor, said Orouba Barakat\'s sister, Shaza Barakat, who came from Syria to attend the funeral.She said her sister and her family had been critical of Syrian President Bashar Assad\'s government and suggested that the government may be behind the killings.Orouba had left Syria in the 1980s, worked as a journalist for Arab newspapers, covering economic and political affairs. She later traveled to America where she gave birth to her daughter. She is separated from her U.S.-Syrian husband, a physician in the United States, Shaza Barakat said."We accuse the Syrian regime, the gangs, because we are against the unjust government, this deadly oppressor, which has killed three quarters of the Syrians and displaced the rest, and destroyed all of Syria," Shaza Barakat said in messages to The Associated Press.According to Syrian opposition activists, Orouba was a member of the Syrian National Council. She had backed the uprising against Assad and had supported the opposition, even as she was critical of some opposition groups.Her daughter was a journalist working for the opposition\'s Orient news. Earlier this year, she took part in a talk titled "Russia destroyed Syria."Media advocacy group Reporters Without Borders has urged Turkey\'s government to protect Syrian journalists in exile in the country.Halla and her mother were also close friends of American aid worker Kayla Mueller, who was taken hostage by ISIS militants in Aleppo in 2013 and then killed nearly a year-and-a-half later, according to ABC News.The Associated Press contributed to this story.', "SHAH ALAM, Malaysia – A byproduct of VX nerve agent was found on the shirt of the Indonesian woman on trial in Malaysia for the murder of the half brother of North Korea's leader, a chemist said on Thursday.The testimony was the first evidence linking VX to either of the two suspects.Previous witnesses have testified the nerve agent was found on Kim Jong Nam's body and belongings and have identified acute VX poisoning as the cause of Kim's death.Government chemist Raja Subramaniam told the court he found VX acid, a byproduct of the banned chemical weapon, on Siti Aisyah's sleeveless T-shirt.Raja said VX will degrade when it reacts with water, leaving detectable byproducts, and a person can fully decontaminate their hands by washing and scrubbing.Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam pleaded not guilty on Monday, the trial's first day.They are accused of wiping VX on Kim's face in an assassination widely thought to have been orchestrated by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.The post-mortem report said toxicology tests found traces of drugs in Kim's body used to treat diabetes, hypertension and gout. The report gave Kim's age as 46 and his name as Kim Chol, the pseudonym he used in the North Korean passport he carried at the time of his death.The Associated Press contributed to this report", 'Kurdistan’s Dangerous Vote on Independence - The New York TimesThe referendum on independence that Iraqi Kurds held on Monday was unwise, dangerous and very understandable.Unwise, because it raised high and probably unachievable hopes among Kurds not only in Iraq, but also in Iran, Turkey and Syria, the countries where they live.Dangerous because those yearnings trigger multiple alarms in one of the least stable regions on earth.And understandable because few people have dreamed of independence for so long, at such cost and with so little success.Even before full results were in, there was little doubt the Kurds had voted overwhelmingly for a separate state. It is hard not to sympathize with that longing, especially given the brutal suppression of Iraqi Kurds under Saddam Hussein. Since the 1991 gulf war, the five million Iraqi Kurds have created a semiautonomous Kurdistan region whose rich oil and gas resources have supported a relatively peaceful existence. Kurdish military forces, the pesh merga, have played a major role in the fight against the Islamic State.Massoud Barzani, the president of Kurdistan, as the Kurdish region in Iraq is known, has said the vote will not lead to an immediate, unilateral declaration of independence, but to the opening of negotiations with Baghdad and consultations with neighboring states and other powers.Yet Iraq, Iran, Syria, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the Arab League and the United States, as well as the European Union and the United Nations, all tried to pre-empt the vote. Iraq has no intention of losing rich oil fields. The White House declared the referendum “provocative and destabilizing,” and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis traveled to Kurdistan last month to argue that the referendum would be a distraction from the fight against ISIS. Turkey, Iran and Syria fear that their restive Kurdish minorities will join in secessionist demands. Only Israel, with a history of close ties to Kurds and hopes for an ally against Iran, has declared support for a Kurdish state.In any case, the vote was held. There is a new and volatile reality that cannot be denied. All sides — the Kurds, their neighbors, Washington and all the others involved — must avoid any action that could prompt violence. Then, urgent efforts must begin to channel newly fired passions into what room remains for diplomatic maneuvers. The United States, whose forces have long protected Iraqi Kurds and fought alongside the pesh merga, should be at the forefront of that search.', 'TIRANA, Albania – Albanian police have told a group of home fans to stay away from the World Cup soccer qualifier against Italy on Monday.A statement Sunday said the Illyria Elite group was banned from the stadium in northern Albania after "problems" at Albania\'s game in Italy in March. Italy won that game 2-0 which saw flares thrown on the field by a group calling itself Illyrian Elite.Police also said they were taking extra security steps in the light of concerns over what they called "extremist and violent individuals or groups." The measures include enhanced checks at border crossing points with neighboring Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro, along with extra security at Durres port and Tirana International Airport.The police statement said they would prevent entry into the country of "individuals with tendencies of radicalism or extremism," but gave no further details.Monday\'s game will be played at Shkoder, 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of capital Tirana. Another Group G qualifier against Israel was moved from Shkoder to Elbasan last year over security concerns.With one round left, Spain has won Group G and second-place Italy is seven points ahead of Albania, which cannot qualify.Albania is coached by Christian Panucci, an Italian who predicted a tough match after Italy was held at home by Macedonia last weekend.___Follow Llazar Semini on Twitter at https://twitter.com/lsemini', 'I Believe Some of Your Best Friends Are Jewish - The New York TimesI believe Valerie Plame, the former C.I.A. operative and fading liberal celebrity, when she says she missed the anti-Semitic “undercurrents” in an article she called “provocative, but thoughtful.” I believe her when she says she “zeroed in on the neocon criticism” but missed the article’s more prejudicial elements.The article was titled “America’s Jews Are Driving America’s Wars.” It uses variants of the word “Jew” 22 times. The word “neocons” appears only twice. I believe Plame is telling the truth when she says the subtlety was lost on her.I believed Donald Trump when he insisted last year there was nothing amiss with him tweeting the image of a six-pointed star superimposed over a pile of $100 bills alongside a picture of Hillary Clinton and the caption “Most corrupt candidate ever!” I believe him when he said it was a sheriff’s star, not a Star of David.I did not believe white supremacist David Duke when he said there was “no way” it was a sheriff’s star. What does David Duke know about dog whistles anyway?I believe the national council of the American Studies Association was taking an “ethical stance” when it voted unanimously in 2013 for an academic boycott of Israeli institutions. I find nothing askance in the association never previously boycotting the institutions of any other country. I believe the group’s then-president, Curtis Marez, made a valid argument that Israel was targeted because “one has to start somewhere.”I believe the A.S.A. will one day get around to boycotting the academic institutions of China for its occupation of Tibet, or of Russia for its occupation of Ukraine, or of India for its alleged occupation of Kashmir. I believe there’s nothing discriminatory in singling out the Jewish state for behavior the A.S.A. accepts from other states.I believed then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when he said, at a New York breakfast I attended in 2010, that anti-Semitism is mostly unknown in his country. I believe that the Islamic Republic is welcoming toward its Jews, as evidenced by the one seat it reserves in its Parliament for a Jew.I believe there’s nothing anti-Semitic in calling for Israel to be wiped off the map. I believe Iranian leaders are only interested in historical scholarship and artistic freedom when they hosted a conference for Holocaust deniers or supported Holocaust cartoon contests. I believe a Jewish community in Iran that has experienced mass emigration since the Iranian revolution is happy with its political masters.I believed there was nothing amiss with former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel remarking in 2006 that “the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people” on Capitol Hill. I believe the Jewish lobby must be uniquely intimidating to American lawmakers, unlike, say, the National Rifle Association or the agriculture lobby.I believe Hagel had nothing to apologize for in the remark for which he later apologized during his confirmation process for secretary of defense. I believe Hagel’s apology was sincere. I believe his apology for opposing James Hormel’s nomination as Bill Clinton’s ambassador to Luxembourg — Hagel slammed Hormel as “openly, aggressively gay” — was also sincere.I believe the thesis of “The Israel Lobby,” the 2007 book by Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer, is a sound one. The idea that a small group of (largely) Jewish-Americans manipulates Congress, the media and other levers of power and influence for the benefit of a malign Jewish state has no connection to previous anti-Semitic conspiracy theories alleging the same thing.I believe that when Jeffrey Goldberg called the book’s ideas “awfully close to the Elders of Z” in a devastating review, his views must be treated as suspect. Who does Goldberg work for, anyway?I believe that when Mel Gibson said, in the course of a DUI arrest, “the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world,” he meant it as a statement of hearty approval.I believe that there is nothing curious in the constant ascription of authorship of the 2003 invasion of Iraq to Paul Wolfowitz and Doug Feith, both second-tier officials in the Bush Administration, and Richard Perle, who oversaw a federal advisory committee with no real power. I believe they were much more influential to the decision-making process than Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell or George W. Bush.I believe the fact that Wolfowitz, Feith and Perle happen to be Jewish does not, in any sense, make them convenient villains in that drama.I believe that when left-wing German terrorist Wilfried Böse insisted, during the 1976 hijacking of an Air France jetliner, “I’m no Nazi! I’m an idealist,” he had a point. Böse and his partner, Brigitte Kuhlmann, separated the passengers between Israelis and non-Israelis, freeing the latter while holding the former hostage at Entebbe airport, Uganda, before their rescue by Israeli troops.I believe that targeting Jews for being Jews is anti-Semitism, but targeting Israelis for being Israelis is a legitimate form of political resistance. I believe anti-Zionism has nothing to do with anti-Semitism. I believe calling for the elimination of the Zionist entity is a morally legitimate idea.Another thing: I believe Valerie Plame when she writes, “Just FYI, I am of Jewish descent.” I believe some of her best friends are Jewish.(Hat tip: Michael Kelly, 1957-2003)', 'Trump Should Bet on Kurdish Independence - The New York TimesNo one likes winning more than President Trump. He has a chance to prove it on Monday, when Iraqi Kurds hold a referendum on their independence.There is no shortage of losers in the Middle East, but anyone in the business of spotting winners should bet on an independent Kurdish state. Backing the Kurds is not only strategically smart — they are a steadfast ally in the fight against the Islamic State and Islamist extremism, doing battle alongside American soldiers — it’s also the right thing to do.Yet the Trump administration has worked to prevent the referendum, arguing that with the war against the Islamic State yet to be won, a vote could risk further dividing an already fractious coalition. In a statement, it called the referendum “provocative and destabilizing.”This is a serious mistake. In failing to offer full-throated support for Kurdish independence, the United States is focusing solely on the short-term volatility of the region and overlooking serious medium- and long-term opportunities.There’s no denying that the Middle East is a mess: To truly stabilize the region, we need to defeat the Islamic State, replace the brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and contain Iran, which still threatens to go nuclear. But the best way to stamp out darkness isn’t through military might, but through light. And an independent Kurdish state would be a beacon of hope in a part of the world where hope is desperately needed.An independent Kurdish state would be a victory for democratic values, national self-determination and the rights of women and minorities. Is there a more iconic image of the fight against the Islamic State than that of female Kurdish peshmerga fighters doing battle on the front lines against jihadists who demand the subjugation of women? An independent Kurdish state would empower these warriors in a part of the world where women and girls are typically second-class citizens.In addition to its commitment to gender equality, Kurdistan has also shown its commitment to minority rights. Over the past three years, Kurdistan, which is about the size of Maryland, has taken in nearly two million refugees, including Assyrians, Yazidis, Turkmen, Shabaks and Christians fleeing the Islamic State and sectarian violence in other parts of Iraq and in Syria.Even without a formal state, the Kurds have built a society that meets many of the criteria of statehood. They are economically viable, with a well-developed energy industry. They have functioning institutions, including elections for Parliament and a relatively free media. And they’ve proved capable of defending themselves against the Islamic State without attacking others.Kurdistan is already, in values and governance, a democratic nation in waiting. Is it a perfect Jeffersonian democracy? No. Does it have a long way to go? Yes. But in a region where tyranny is the norm, it’s on the right track.With a state, the Kurds could become an even more valuable and constructive ally against extremism. That would be in the American interest, but just as important, it would be a fulfillment of American values. Supporting Kurdish independence means supporting the right to self-determination of a people that have overcome oppression, persecution and tyranny to build a thriving, vibrant society. That’s one of the reasons Israel supports the Kurds’ right to self-determination.Some 30 years ago, the Kurdish people were being choked with chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein. Today they stand as a nation reborn, about to embark on an inspiring exercise in democracy. We have a moral duty to support its outcome. In a region where the flags of liberal democracies are routinely set alight, Kurdistan has chosen to embrace liberal democratic values.Now the United States faces a critical choice. President Trump has the chance to demonstrate American leadership, promote American values and strengthen an American ally. Israel would welcome his support for the Kurds. And if handled intelligently, the pragmatic Arab states such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates could follow suit, on the grounds that Kurdistan could serve as a bulwark against Iran and the Islamic State.If we wait for the region to be perfectly stable, for Islamist extremism to disappear or for the collective blessing of Ankara, Tehran and Baghdad, we could be waiting forever. If, however, the United States wants to support a stabilizing, modernizing and democratic force, the choice is clear: Mr. Trump should bet on a winner and support an independent Kurdish state.', 'What Does It Take to Tighten Gun Laws? - The New York TimesTo the Editor:On Monday, after the Las Vegas massacre, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said it was too soon to discuss gun control. Somewhere in Washington, gun lobbyists were conspiring to spin the news. After Sandy Hook, they had called for better mental health care. After San Bernardino, they had demanded looser concealed-carry laws. After Pulse in Orlando, they had decried “radical Islam.” But now their grab bag of excuses is completely empty.Stephen Paddock apparently had no history of mental illness or criminal record and reportedly did not belong to any terrorist organization. His perch high above the Las Vegas Strip made it impossible for his targets below to return fire even if they had had a firearm.I don’t doubt that the National Rifle Association and fellow lobbyists will find a way to kill gun control legislation once again. But this time their spin will have to be truly imaginative.STUART RICHARDSON, PARISTo the Editor:The Republican claim that now is not the time to talk about increased gun control laws is absurd. If the plague were killing our citizens, it would absolutely be the time to speak about rat control measures. If citizens were repeatedly killed in plane accidents, we would immediately consult experts regarding aviation safety issues.Our citizens are being gunned down on a regular basis. If our elected representatives are too tied to ideology or too beholden to special interests to take serious action on gun control laws as thousands of our citizens die from gun wounds each year, those representatives have no business being in office — and it is absolutely the time to talk about that.KATHARINE JONES, NEW YORKTo the Editor:Re “477 Days. 521 Mass Shootings. Zero Action by Congress” (editorial, Oct. 3):With the Las Vegas massacre setting a new “worst ever” record in modern American history, I wonder about the gun lobby’s tipping point. How many people must be killed for the gun lobby and its congressional supplicants to accept reasonable controls that many (if not most) Americans want?We know that a 59-death tragedy is below the tipping point. What about 100? 1,000?Sadly, I’m sure that I will see death tallies increase. But I don’t think I’ll ever see the gun lobby accept sensible restrictions.ALAN RUTKIN, GREAT NECK, N.Y.To the Editor:Your editorial graphic on mass shootings is stunning. Without in any way glorifying these shootings, I propose that you set aside a small area on Page 2 to note each one going forward. Perhaps that will help build the momentum we need to confront the National Rifle Association and change our gun laws.BARBARA GOLD, PHILADELPHIATo the Editor:Re “Will Politicians Finally Act? No,” by Steve Israel (Op-Ed, Oct. 3):Many are agonizing over the question “why?” Why did this man decide to murder so many in Las Vegas? Are we missing the obvious motive in the mass murders there and elsewhere recently? Couldn’t this just be suicide by murder?It used to be that suicides acted mostly in isolation. But now, with the ready availability of weapons capable of mass destruction, anyone with so much misery and hopelessness can express those feelings in a final horrifying act.A Harvard study has found a strong correlation between gun ownership and suicide rates. The connection suggests that there is something we can do about both kinds of tragedies: Limit the kinds and broad availability of guns on the market.DAVID A. VACCARI, METUCHEN, N.J.To the Editor:Sadly, I agree with Steve Israel that nothing will change. Even though virtually all recent mass shootings in this country have been carried out by native-born Americans, President Trump and his Republican colleagues continue to support enhanced background checks and extreme vetting of foreigners as a way to keep America safe. Wouldn’t it be refreshing if they called for the same extreme vetting of people in this country trying to obtain military-grade assault weapons?BERYL ROSENSTEIN, BALTIMORETo the Editor:Re “Suspect, an Unmoored Retiree, Kept Quiet and Gambled Often” (front page, Oct. 3):Here was someone who lived in relative obscurity and anonymity. He didn’t seem to have many friends or relatives he kept in touch with. He lived below the radar. As we all try to understand the motivations for the Las Vegas tragedy, let’s not turn killers, whether in life or death, into sudden fame. Let’s keep them below the radar. The focus belongs on those who lost their lives or were injured in this senseless tragedy, and on those who helped save others.ALAN KIRSCHNER, BETHESDA, MD.', 'Unity Deal Offers Hope for Palestinians and a Respite for Gaza - The New York TimesCAIRO — After a decade of hostility and recrimination, the two main Palestinian factions came together in Cairo on Thursday to sign a reconciliation deal that holds out the tantalizing prospect of a united Palestinian front.Hopes for the agreement, signed under the watchful eye of Egyptian intelligence, were tempered by the knowledge that many previous Palestinian initiatives have failed. Yet there is optimism that this time may be different, partly because the stakes are so much higher.For the two million Palestinians of Gaza, trapped in a tiny coastal strip that is frequently compared to an open-air prison, the Cairo deal offered a potential respite from their lives of dire shortages of electricity and lifesaving medicine, as well as a chance to travel to the outside world.For the Palestinian leadership, it held out the prospect of negotiating with Israel with a single voice, even as it forced the divided territory’s most radical militants to make painful concessions that acknowledged their own failure to advance their cause.Hamas, which controls Gaza and has fought Israel three times, said it was ready to cede control of Gaza’s borders and allow the rival Palestinian Authority to effectively take over the day-to-day running of the territory.It was a sobering reality check for a group that, despite years of fiery defiance and arms supplies from Iran, cannot rule Gaza without help from Fatah, the rival faction that controls the Palestinian Authority and was driven out of Gaza in violent clashes 10 years ago.And for Mahmoud Abbas, the 82-year-old president of the Palestinian Authority, it could amount to a legacy-saving moment in the twilight years of his rule, after years of abject failure to negotiate a peace settlement with Israel. Although he was not in Cairo, Mr. Abbas gave his blessing to the deal, which he hailed as a “final agreement,” according to Agence France-Presse.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said that Israel “objects to any reconciliation that does not include” accepting international agreements, recognizing Israel and disarming Hamas. A Fatah-Hamas rapprochement would make “peace much harder to achieve,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a post on Facebook. “Reconciling with mass-murderers is part of the problem, not part of the solution.”At a brief ceremony on Thursday at the headquarters of Egypt’s General Intelligence Service, which shepherded the negotiations, representatives from Hamas and Fatah kissed and embraced amid a smattering of applause from Egyptian and Palestinian officials gathered around them.The Palestinians did not release the text of the agreement, and there was no mention of the thorny issues that remain unresolved, such as the fate of the main Hamas militia, or the network of tunnels under Gaza used by fighters and weapons smugglers.But officials from both sides described a series of agreed measures that are due to unfold in the coming weeks, and which they say will both sideline Hamas from the day-to-day running of Gaza and create a political groundswell for a broader deal to reunite the Palestinian territories.Egypt’s State Information Service said that the rivals had agreed to hand full control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority by Dec. 1. Palestinian officials said that if the process goes well, Mr. Abbas could visit Gaza in the coming month, his first visit to the embattled coastal strip in a decade.Egypt has set Nov. 21 for the next step of the process: a meeting in Cairo of all Palestinian factions that, it hopes, will be the start of talks toward a Palestinian unity government. Some Palestinian officials said they hoped such a government could be formed by January.But much depends on how things transpire in Gaza over the coming weeks.Under terms of the deal, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority will form a joint police force of at least 5,000 officers, and merge their ministries. One Hamas official said they would negotiate to slim down the bloated civil service, cutting up to 40,000 of the 200,000 jobs.Two elements of the deal promise to quickly ease conditions in Gaza, which aid organizations have called an emerging humanitarian crisis.The Palestinian Authority has agreed to lift sanctions that it imposed on Gaza this year as part of its effort to pressure Hamas into talks. The government cut electricity supplies to a few hours a day in Gaza and stopped paying government salaries, an important source of income in a besieged territory with a broken economy.And Hamas will cede control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, Gaza’s main lifeline to the outside world. That would allow Egypt to ease stringent cargo restrictions and enable Gazans to travel outside, perhaps the most significant change in the agreement.But even if the two sides succeed in fully reuniting in the next round of talks, the new arrangement seems unlikely to improve relations with Israel, which has warned that it could not accept a unity government that included Hamas.Hamas has insisted on its right to maintain control of its arsenal — including thousands of rockets, missiles and drones — as well as its militia and its network of fortified tunnels.Across divided Palestine there were cautious celebrations.In Gaza City, vendors passed out sweets to children in Soldier’s Square, a park at the center of town. Mona Khfaja, 37, a pharmacist who said she was unable to leave Gaza to seek treatment for kidney disease, said dissatisfaction with the crushing border restrictions had forced warring Palestinian leaders to the negotiation table.“We do not want the flags of Fatah and Hamas, only the Palestinian flag,” she said.In the West Bank town of Ramallah, Abu Ahmad, 56, said he was wary about getting his hopes up. “Many agreements have been signed in the past, but something has always caused these political parties to back away,” he said, “and I’m afraid there’s still a chance for that to happen again.”The signing ceremony on Thursday followed two days of talks mediated by Egypt’s General Intelligence Service. The deal was signed by the deputy leader of Hamas, Saleh al-Arouri, and Azzam al-Ahmad, the head of the Fatah delegation.Officials from both sides offered frank appraisals of the issues that divide them, and that could easily scupper this latest effort. Ayman Rigib, a Fatah negotiator in Cairo, pointed to the status of Hamas’s Qassam Brigades, with an estimated 20,000 fighters, and Hamas’s extensive tunnels.“We’re worried about the tunnels,” Mr. Rigib said. “We’ve seen Hamas use them in 2014. Will they give us the maps? Will they shut them down? It has not yet been discussed.”Another Palestinian concern is that a unity government involving Hamas could cause the Trump administration to cut funding to the Palestinian territories under congressional rules against funding terrorist organizations. American lawmakers threatened to cut funding in reaction to a similar 2011 deal between Hamas, which the United States designates as a terrorist organization, and the Palestinian Authority. That agreement ultimately fell apart.The United States gives the Palestinian Authority about $400 million in annual assistance. But for now, with Hamas ceding all administrative control of Gaza, there is little danger that aid would be cut off.Grant Rumley, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the issues yet to be resolved would be the most difficult. “Hamas may be willing to cede more administrative control of Gaza,” he said, “but the parties have so far avoided the issues likeliest to derail the talks: namely the relationship with Israel and what to do with Hamas’s military wing.”When leaders from Hamas and Fatah signed the 2011 deal, Mr. Abbas said, “We have turned the black page of division forever.” But the agreement quickly foundered amid opposition from Israel, which denounced it as a “victory for terrorism.”This time, a broad Arab coalition is backing the deal, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.“This merger is going to cost a lot of money, and they will help us financially,” said Ahmed Yousef, an adviser to the Hamas leader Ismail Haniya, referring to Emirati and Saudi support. “The Egyptians also clearly got a green light from America. They are obviously trying to cook up something to help end this conflict.”', 'Albert Einstein’s ‘Theory of Happiness’ Fetches $1.56 Million - The New York TimesMore than a century ago, Albert Einstein’s celebrated theory of relativity altered the world’s understanding of space and time. This week, the wild-haired physicist’s far-simpler “theory of happiness,” imparted to a bellboy, fetched more than $1.5 million at an auction in Jerusalem.In 1922, Einstein was at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, where he was on a lecture tour, and had recently learned that he had won the Nobel Prize. When a bellboy delivered a message to the physicist, he fished in his pocket for some change to tip him and came up empty.Instead, Einstein offered a tip in the form of his theory on how to have a happy life.“A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness,” he wrote in German on a piece of hotel stationery.On a second sheet, he wrote, “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.”Einstein told the bellboy, according to the auction house, that if he was lucky, the notes might become more valuable than a regular tip. His words, befitting a man who had transformed our comprehension of the universe, were prophetic.On Tuesday, Einstein’s theory of happiness was sold by Winner’s Auctions and Exhibition, based in Jerusalem, for $1.56 million, adding him to the pantheon of the world’s most generous tippers.The identity of the seller, who is European, has not been revealed. (The second note sold for $250,000, according to the auction house.)Meni Chadad, a spokesman for Winner’s, said by phone from Jerusalem that the auction house had been approached a few months ago by a grandson of the Japanese bellboy’s brother.After authenticating the documents, he said, the auction house predicted the notes would fetch $5,000 to $8,000. Bidding began at $2,000, but quickly exploded into six figures. The room erupted into applause, Mr. Chadad said.“It was an all-time record for an auction of a document in Israel, and it was just wow, wow, wow,” he added. “I think the value can be explained by the fact that the story behind the tip is so uplifting and inspiring, and because Einstein continues to be a global rock star long after his death.”Winner’s said that when the bellboy arrived at Einstein’s hotel room, the celebrated physicist had recently been informed by telegram that he would be receiving the Nobel Prize, and he had been overwhelmed by thousands of well-wishers who had flocked to see him.It said that the bellboy went to his room just as Einstein was trying to note down his thoughts and feelings. Unable to offer a tip, “he decided to make the most of his new exalted status,” the auction house explained.Einstein, who died in 1955, had a strong connection to Israel. He was a founder of Hebrew University and a member of its board, and bequeathed it all his papers. His wife Elsa donated a manuscript of his general theory of relativity to the university when it opened in 1925.How does Einstein’s tip rank — even if after the fact?One of the world’s most generous “tips” was given on March 30, 1984, at Sal’s Pizzeria in Yonkers, when a police detective named Robert Cunningham offered to give half his prize money from a $1 lottery ticket to a waitress, Phyllis Penzo.Ms. Penzo agreed, and they picked the numbers together. The next day, the ticket won $6 million. The story was later made into a film, “It Could Happen to You.”While Einstein’s theory of happiness affirms the value of the simple life over wealth and success, Mr. Chadad said, the hotel messenger’s descendants were, nevertheless, elated by their new riches.“They are very, very happy,” he said.', 'Region still reeling from earlier, stronger earthquakeA 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck southern Mexico on Saturday, the third to jolt the reeling nation this month.The strong quake was centered about 11 miles south-southeast of Matias Romero in the state of Oaxaca, which was the region most battered by a magnitude 8.1 quake on Sept. 7.A woman died when a wall of her home fell on her in the town of Asuncion Ixtaltepec, and a man died after a wall fell on him in San Blas Atempa.Four people were injured in Juchitan and three in Tlacotepec, but none of their lives were in danger. Another person suffered a broken clavicle in the town of Xadani.The earthquake, which struck around 8 a.m. local time, swayed buildings and set off a seismic alarm in Mexico City, prompting civil defense officials to temporarily suspend rescue operations in the rubble of buildings downed by Thursday\'s magnitude 7.1 quake in central Mexico that killed at least 295 people.A female firefighter is carried out on a stretcher after spraining her ankle as rescue workers race against the clock to reach possible survivors trapped inside an office building in the Roma Norte neighborhood of Mexico City,(AP)That quake dimmed activity in the stylish Condesa neighborhood, where young revelers typically spill out from dimly lit bars and restaurants on a Friday night.Instead of crowds gathered with beers, small handfuls of rescue workers still dressed in reflective vests took breaks from digging through rubble. Entire restaurants with white linen tables were empty. Metal gates shuttered others."It feels lifeless," said Mariana Aguilar, 27, a hostess at a bar and restaurant who stood waiting for guests yet to arrive. "I walk through these streets every day and you never imagine something like this would happen."The upscale Mexico City neighborhood was one of the hardest hit by the quake, with more than a half-dozen collapsed buildings in the immediate vicinity.

"But as good Mexicans we have to keep lending support however we can."As rescue operations stretched into Day 5, residents throughout the city held out hope that dozens still missing might be found alive. More than half the dead —157 — perished in the capital, while another 73 died in the state of Morelos, 45 in Puebla, 13 in Mexico State, six in Guerrero and one in Oaxaca.Along a 60-foot stretch of a bike lane in Mexico City\'s downtown, families huddled under tarps and donated blankets Friday, awaiting word of loved ones trapped in the four-story-high pile of rubble behind them."There are moments when you feel like you\'re breaking down," said Patricia Fernandez Romero, who was waiting for word on the fate of her 27-year-old son. "And there are moments when you\'re a little calmer. ... They are all moments that you wouldn\'t wish on anyone."Along the bike lane, where families slept in tents, accepting food and coffee from strangers, people have organized to present a united front to authorities, who they pressed ceaselessly for information.A Mexican soldier and his dog search for survivors in the rubble of a collapsed building after an earthquake in Mexico City, Mexico September 23, 2017.

On Friday morning, after hours of inactivity blamed on rain, rescuers were readying to re-enter the site, joined by teams from Japan and Israel. Fernandez said officials told them they knew where people were trapped on the fourth floor.It\'s the moments between those bits of information that torment the families."It\'s that you get to a point when you\'re so tense, when they don\'t come out to give us information," she said. "It\'s so infuriating."Jose Gutierrez, a civil engineer attached to the rescue who has a relative trapped in the wreckage, gathered other families of the missing to let them know what was going on."My family is in there. I want them to get out," Gutierrez said, his voice breaking.

It has been accused of processing financial transactions through a branch in New York for groups linked to terrorism. The plaintiffs in the case seek to hold the bank liable for attacks by Hamas and other groups in Israel and in the Palestinian territories.Jeffrey L. Fisher, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients had made grave accusations against the bank.“What we allege is knowing and purposeful financing of terrorism with the expectation that it will make those terrorism attacks more successful and more lucrative for the perpetrators, and that is a violation of the law of nations,” he said.Paul D. Clement, a lawyer for the bank, said American courts have no business sorting out the truth of accusations involving foreign parties and conduct.“This case arises out of a suit by Israeli nationals against a corporation chartered in Jordan for injuries suffered in Israel and the adjoining territories,” he said.Against the background, he said, the court should impose a categorical prohibition on human rights suits against corporations.“I don’t think there is a norm to hold corporations liable for violations of international law,” he said, “especially under jurisdictional circumstances like this where the United States is a stranger to the dispute.”The case, Jesner v. Arab Bank, No. 16-499, seemed to divide the justices along ideological lines; the more conservative justices appeared ready to say that corporations may never be sued under the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 law that allows federal district courts to hear “any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.”Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they feared that hearing cases against corporations under the 1789 law would cause friction in foreign relations.Mr. Fisher said that closing the courthouse door to such suits could also cause tension.“Imagine Israel’s view if our entire finance system could be used and accessed to commit terrorist attacks, make them easier, make them more deadly, make the funding more effective,” he said. “If suits like this were taken away, Israel and countries like it might well have a complaint to the United States.”In 2013, in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, the Supreme Court imposed strict limits on suits under the 1789 law, though it did not rule on whether corporations may ever be defendants in them. Instead, the majority said there was a general presumption against the extraterritorial application of American law.Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, said that even minimal contact with the United States would not be sufficient to overcome the presumption.“Even where the claims touch and concern the territory of the United States,” he wrote, “they must do so with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application.”That decision led to the dismissal of many lawsuits, Mr. Fisher told the justices. In 2013, he said, there were 40 lawsuits pending against corporations under the 1789 law. “In the two years after Kiobel,” he said, “over 70 percent of those cases were dismissed on extraterritoriality grounds, and another 10 percent were dismissed for other reasons.”On Wednesday, the more liberal justices said courts had many ways to police abusive lawsuits without giving corporations a free pass. Justice Elena Kagan, for instance, told a lawyer for the bank that “you have plenty of things to gripe about in this lawsuit.” But she added that corporate liability was not one of them.Brian H. Fletcher, a lawyer for the Justice Department, basically endorsed that analysis. “We have serious questions about whether or not this case belongs in U.S. court precisely because it is extraterritorial, potentially,” he said. But he urged the justices not to adopt a categorical rule that corporations may never be sued under the 1789 law.That law was largely ignored until the 1980s, when federal courts started to apply it in international human rights cases. A 2004 Supreme Court decision, Sosa v. Álvarez-Machain, left the door open to some claims under the law, as long as they involved violations of international norms with “definite content and acceptance among civilized nations.”The federal appeals courts are divided over whether corporations may be sued under the law. In 2011, the Supreme Court agreed to resolve the question in the Kiobel case. But it ended up ducking the issue, ruling instead that federal courts should be wary of suits that barely concern the United States.', 'Film Series in NYC This Week - The New York TimesOur guide to film series and special screenings. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.‘DIRECTED BY DENNIS HOPPER’ at the Metrograph (Nov. 3-8). Around the end of the 1960s, Mr. Hopper, as a director, made an era-defining classic (“Easy Rider,” showing Tuesday and Wednesday) and an end-of-an-era semi-fiasco (the wildly innovative “The Last Movie,” showing Friday, whose making is addressed in the documentary “Along for the Ride,” opening this week). And although he is probably most remembered his subsequent turns as unhinged villains (“Blue Velvet,” “Speed”), he didn’t stop directing. “Out of the Blue” (Saturday and Tuesday), a ragged portrait of a punk youth (Linda Manz) and her troubled home life (Mr. Hopper plays her jailbird father), makes haunting use of Neil Young tracks and is regarded by some as a neglected great film of the 1980s. Calling the movie a “late-blooming masterpiece,” the critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that it proved Mr. Hopper to be an “heir to the cinema of Nicholas Ray.”212-660-0312, metrograph.com‘ORIGIN STORIES: GRETA GERWIG’S FOOTNOTES TO “LADY BIRD”’ at the Quad Cinema (through Nov. 9). To accompany the release of “Lady Bird” (opening Friday), her first solo directorial feature, Ms. Gerwig has compiled a program of movies that influenced her. Some of the titles, like the Northern California coming-of-age classic “American Graffiti” (Saturday and Tuesday) and D.A. Pennebaker’s “Original Cast Album: Company” (Friday, Saturday and Wednesday), have clear bearings on “Lady Bird,” which follows a Sacramento teenager (Saoirse Ronan) as she copes with her family, adolescent romance, college applications and high school theater. Other titles, like Mike Leigh’s “Secrets & Lies” (Monday, Tuesday and Thursday), connect in more oblique and intriguing ways.212-255-2243, quadcinema.comOTHER ISRAEL FILM FESTIVAL at various locations (through Nov. 9). This annual festival emphasizes voices from what it calls the “other Israel.” In this year’s edition, that label includes Palestinian and Arab-Israeli communities and, in the documentary “Desert Wounds” (Tuesday and Wednesday), Christian refugees from Eritrea and Sudan.

Perhaps the best-known film adaptations of Lem, the Polish science-fiction author, are the two versions of “Solaris” — one from 1972, a brooding, glacially paced philosophical meditation by Andrei Tarkovsky, and Steven Soderbergh’s remake from 2002, a concise, poetic recapitulation of the same themes. But both films were actually late to the punch. Anthology Film Archives will also show the rare “Solyaris” (Sunday), from 1968, shot in black-and-white for Russian television. This survey of Lem on screen also includes the half-live-action, half-animated “The Congress” (Sunday and Nov. 11), from 2013, directed by Ari Folman (“Waltz With Bashir”). It centers on an aging actress (Robin Wright) who agrees to have her likeness digitally archived for future use.212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org', '                                    The United States reportedly plans to vote against a United Nations resolution on Nazis.

That\'s a non-starter in the U.S., where First Amendment protections guarantee all the right to utter almost anything they want — even praise for Adolf Hitler and his ideology.LONGTIME NEO-NAZI REVEALS HE\'S GAY, HAS JEWISH HERITAGEFlags of some of the 193 countries fly in the breeze outside the United Nations building in New York City. (AP)The U.S., along with just a handful of other countries, votes against the resolution every year, while the European Union nations and some others typically abstain. The resolution always passes overwhelmingly.But this year, the "no" vote from the U.S. is likely to create more of a stir, given it\'s the first vote since President Trump took office. Trump\'s critics have said he\'s insufficiently critical of neo-Nazis.So U.S. officials are working overtime this year to try to explain that "no" vote: America doesn\'t support pro-Nazi speech — but can\'t vote for a resolution that calls for outlawing it, either. The vote is scheduled for Thursday.All resolutions in the General Assembly committees are non-binding and none impose any legal requirements on member nations. But American support for resolutions that contradict domestic law could end up being used as arguments in U.S. federal court, and officials worry about undermining national law enforcement efforts.A similar drama bedeviled the Trump administration last month when the U.S. voted against a resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Council condemning the use of the death penalty to punish homosexuality — another apparent no-brainer. The U.S. couldn\'t vote for that because of the resolution\'s broader condemnation of the death penalty, even though the U.S. adamantly opposes capital punishment for homosexuality, blasphemy, adultery and apostasy, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at the time.A man wearing a shirt with swastikas walks outside the location where white nationalist Richard Spencer gives a speech.(Reuters)\'SIMPSONS\' COMPARES KELLYANNE CONWAY TO NAZI PROPAGANDA MINISTER“The United States clearly has the death penalty, both at the state and at the federal level,” Nauert said. “That is why we voted against this.”In addition, the U.S. has long expressed concerns that Russia uses the annual resolution to mount political attacks against its neighbors. That\'s because Moscow has for decades sought to portray the Baltic states and others that sought independence from Soviet domination as either pro-fascist or pro-Nazi, U.S. officials said.In the past, Israel has voted for the resolution. But Washington has been pushing the Jewish state to vote “no” this year, or at a minimum to abstain. But it\'s unclear how Israel will vote. A spokesman for Israel\'s mission to the U.N. didn\'t immediately respond to a request for comment.The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'JERUSALEM – A beehive-like structure built deep underground in Jerusalem is providing an innovative solution for the holy city\'s chronic shortage of burial space for the dead.Tunnels stretching more than a kilometer (half mile) in length beneath Jerusalem\'s main cemetery have been carefully excavated over the past two years to make room for some 22,000 graves — enough space to meet the city\'s needs for the next decade.A 50-meter (55-yard) elevator shaft will connect the world above with the world below."We came up with this idea to provide a solution under the cemetery with burial structures, but also hidden from the eye," said Arik Glazer, chief executive of Rolzur Tunneling. "There is not enough land and we take advantage of this."Glazer called the planned city of the dead deep below ground both aesthetic and respectful.Cemetery overcrowding presents a challenge the world over, particularly in cramped cities and among religions that forbid or discourage cremation, such as Judaism. The reality of relying on finite land resources to cope with the endless stream of the dying has forced many to look about for creative ways to resolve the problem.Israel, for instance, has been at the forefront of a global movement building vertical cemeteries in densely populated countries. In parts of Israel, elevated cemeteries are now the default option for the recently departed. After some initial hesitations, and rabbinical rulings that made the practice kosher, Israel\'s ultra-Orthodox burial societies have embraced the concept.Glazer said that his project also required rabbinic approval. Israel\'s rabbinic authorities oversee burial practices for the country\'s Jewish majority. He said one of Israel\'s chief rabbis even visited the site."Everyone really appreciated it," he said, saying it revived a practice that was popular centuries ago. "Burials like this existed in ancient times, 1,600 to 2,000 years ago, and we have we have revived this tradition because of the lack of burial space," he said.In a city where archaeological digs unveil findings of international historic value, Glazer\'s operation took extreme precautions not to disturb ancient ruins or graves. The $50 million project, funded by Chevra Kadisha, a Jewish burial society, is expected to be completed in late 2018.When it is done, families will be able to enter the tunnels on foot or with elevators. Platforms will be built at various levels to allow easy access to the stacks of graves."It\'s the first of its kind in the world, at least in the modern world," Glazer said.Experts seem to agree. This week the project was nominated for an award by the International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association, or ITA. The tunnel finished as a runner-up in the "Innovative Underground Space Concept of the Year" category.The 74-nation ITA encourages the use of the subsurface for sustainable development and promotes advances in planning, construction and safety of underground construction.', 'Iran-Iraq Earthquake Kills More Than 500 - The New York TimesTEHRAN — Iranians dug through rubble in a frantic search for survivors on Monday, after a powerful earthquake struck near the Iraqi border, killing more than 500 people and injuring thousands of others in the world’s deadliest earthquake so far this year.The quake, recorded at 9:48 p.m. on Sunday, was felt as far away as Turkey and Pakistan. The epicenter was near Ezgeleh, Iran, about 135 miles northeast of Baghdad, and had a preliminary magnitude of 7.3, according to the United States Geological Survey. Seismologists in the country said it was the biggest quake to hit the western part of Iran.Photographs from the region — a patchwork of farms and home to many Kurds, a large ethnic minority in Iran — posted on the internet showed collapsed buildings, cars destroyed by rubble and people sleeping in the streets in fear of aftershocks.At least 530 people were killed and 7,460 people were injured in Iran, according to the state-run news agency IRNA. At least eight people were killed on the Iraqi side of the border, according to Dr. Saif al-Badir, a spokesman for the Health Ministry, and at least 535 were hurt.In Tehran, hundreds of people waited in line to donate blood in response to a call from the government. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, delivered a message of condolence on Monday, urging rescue workers to keep searching for survivors.“The officials should hasten in these first hours with all their might and determination to help the injured, especially those trapped under the rubble,” his office reported.By the evening, however, Iranian officials said that the rescue mission was nearly over, according to the state news media.Particularly hard hit was Pol-e Zahab, a city in the western Iranian province of Kermanshah, according to the semiofficial Iranian Students News Agency. The authorities said that at least 236 people had died in the city, which has a population of 30,000, and the main hospital was believed to be at least partly running.“My friend was screaming, saying, ‘I lost my home,’ ” one resident wrote on Twitter. “Thank God, she and her family are doing well. She said people were only mourning and their loved ones were under the rubble.”One image from Pol-e Zahab appeared to show the near-destruction of an apartment block recently built for low-income families. Another, posted on the website Khabar Online, showed a pickup truck transporting victims under colorful blankets.Farhad Tarji, a member of Parliament for Pol-e Zahab, told the semiofficial news agency ILNA that his family had been devastated by the quake. “I’ve lost 15 people,” he said.The Iranian government newspaper posted a video on its website in which a resident of Pol-e Zahab complained that no aid had come.“There has been no help yet, neither food nor water, no clothing, no tents, there is nothing,” said the resident, a man who appeared to be in his 30s, while standing in a street with collapsed buildings. “There are no facilities yet. We’ve slept outside since last night. This is the condition of our homes. Our electricity, water, gas, phone lines are out, everything is completely out, the whole city has been destroyed, it is wrecked.”An image posted on social media showed soldiers searching through the rubble at night without flashlights or torches, using their cellphones for light.Officials from the Health Ministry traveled to the area, as did the commander in chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, Brig. Gen. Mohammed Ali Jafari, but foreign reporters were not allowed to visit the scene, in a change from previous disasters.The Iranian Red Crescent used rescue dogs to search for survivors, as it has since an earthquake in the southern city of Bam in 2003 that killed more than 20,000 people. The country’s religious leaders regard dogs as unclean, but the use of guard and rescue dogs is accepted.Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was president of Iran from 2005 to 2013, introduced a program to build low-income housing, including in Pol-e Zahab. After the quake on Sunday, his political opponents said that many of the buildings had been poorly constructed, but his defenders said that the buildings were on fault lines and that nothing could have been done.Initial reports from the Kurdish region of Iraq indicated less damage and fewer deaths on that side of the border. In Sulaimaniya, the second-largest city in Iraq’s Kurdish region, residents described feeling heavy tremors but said there was no notable building damage. Residents in the oil-rich town of Kirkuk, roughly 50 miles to the west, reported similar damage.Ali Namiq, a resident of the town Darbandikhan, Iraq, said a building was flattened by the quake. “The building fell on a seven-member family,” he told Reuters. “We managed to rescue only five out of them, while the two others were killed. It was the first time for me to see an earthquake. It is a divine act that no one can prevent.”In the town of Kalar, Iraq, the quake sent items tumbling from shelves in a supermarket, causing shoppers to flee.The quake occurred about 20 miles south of the Iraqi city of Halabja, where Saddam Hussein’s government launched a poison gas attack that killed more than 5,000 people, mostly Kurds, on March 16, 1988, in the closing days of the Iran-Iraq war.The earthquake was felt as far as the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Shiite pilgrims in the Iraqi city of Karbala, for the annual religious commemoration of Arba’een, posted videos of people gathering on the streets after the earthquake.Iran lies on dozens of fault lines and is prone to quakes. In 2012, a double earthquake in the north of the country killed 300 people. When residents learned of the government’s lackluster relief efforts,  some started organizing aid groups themselves. After that quake, the United States, which does not maintain normal diplomatic relations with Iran, sent several planeloads of aid.', 'Germany’s Future, and Europe’s - The New York TimesTo the Editor:Re “Germany’s Time of Troubles” (editorial, Nov. 24):Amid the tumultuous political developments in trans-Atlantic and European affairs over the last decade, Germany has been a bedrock of stability, with Chancellor Angela Merkel a key global leader. But German federal elections in September tossed her leadership and German politics into a political tailspin whose end is not in sight.Efforts to form a coalition are challenging, with the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany party gaining the support of 12.6 percent of the electorate. For the first time since World War II, Germany’s parliament will have a large right-wing bloc with members who express revisionist views and even glorify the Nazi past.At a time when German leadership is needed more than ever to calm political convulsions tearing at the fabric of European unity, Germany is dealing with its own political disputes on issues like immigration, climate, tax policy and welfare subsidies, leaving it with diminished capacity to fight anti-Europe sentiments.Still, the stakes for determining Germany’s future as a European leader have seldom been higher. Critically important is ensuring that whatever the election outcome, Germany will remain a key force in countering intolerance, populism and hatred in Europe, and a supporter of Israel and the trans-Atlantic bond.DEIDRE BERGER, BERLINThe writer is director of the American Jewish Committee’s Berlin Ramer Institute.', 'Trump Recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s Capital and Orders U.S. Embassy to Move - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing nearly seven decades of American foreign policy and setting in motion a plan to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to the fiercely contested Holy City.“Today we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel’s capital,” Mr. Trump said from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. “This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It’s something that has to be done.”The president cast his decision as a break with decades of failed policy on Jerusalem, which the United States, along with virtually every other nation in the world, has declined to recognize as the capital since Israel’s founding in 1948. That policy, he said, brought us “no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.”“It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result,” Mr. Trump declared.Recognizing Jerusalem, he added, was “a long overdue step to advance the peace process.”Mr. Trump’s remarks were the most closely scrutinized of his presidency on the Middle East, where he has vowed to broker the “ultimate deal” between Israelis and Palestinians but has yet to find a breakthrough to end the conflict. He said he remained committed to brokering an agreement “that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.”The president said the decision to recognize Jerusalem should not be construed as the United States taking a position on whether, or how, the city might ultimately be shared. But he offered little solace to the Palestinians, making no mention of their long-held hopes for East Jerusalem to be the capital of a Palestinian state.Instead, Mr. Trump emphasized the domestic political dimension of the decision. He noted that he had promised to move the embassy during the 2016 presidential campaign, and added, “While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.”Though he did not mention it, Mr. Trump signed the same national security waiver signed by his predecessors, from Barack Obama to George W. Bush to Bill Clinton, which will allow the administration to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for an additional six months. White House officials said that was unavoidable because it would take several years to move the embassy staff to a new facility in Jerusalem.“There will of course, be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement,” the president said. He appealed for “calm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate.”Mr. Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem isolates the United States on one of the world’s most sensitive diplomatic issues. It has drawn a storm of criticism from Arab and European leaders, which swelled on Tuesday night after the White House confirmed Mr. Trump’s plans.Pope Francis and the Chinese foreign ministry joined the chorus of voices warning that the move could unleash a wave of violence across the region. At a meeting in Brussels, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson was sternly reproached by European allies.Standing next to Mr. Tillerson, the European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, made clear that Europe saw the president’s decision as a threat to peace in the Middle East.“We believe that any action that would undermine these efforts must absolutely be avoided,” she said. “A way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as a future capital of both states.”Just hours before Mr. Trump made his announcement, Mr. Tillerson said that peace in the Middle East was still possible.Mr. Tillerson, during a news conference at NATO headquarters in the heart of Europe, expressed reassurances about the expected consequences of the decision.“The president’s very committed to the Middle East peace process,” Mr. Tillerson said.Mr. Tillerson has been largely shut out of the usual back-and-forth between Israelis and Palestinians that many secretaries of state spent much of their tenures conducting. Instead, Mr. Trump entrusted that task to his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.At least one former Obama administration official also weighed in with sharp criticism. John O. Brennan, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said in a statement that Mr. Trump’s action was “reckless” and would “damage U.S. interests in the Middle East for years to come and will make the region more volatile.”Administration officials said they expected the blowback from the Palestinians and others, but they asserted that the move would accelerate, not hinder, the peace process.Mr. Trump’s promise to move the embassy appealed to evangelical voters and pro-Israel American Jews, including Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate. By delivering on that promise, Mr. Trump’s aides said, he was enhancing his credibility as a peacemaker.The announcement, officials said, was recognition of current and historic reality. West Jerusalem is the seat of Israel’s government, and recognizing it as such would remove ambiguity from the American position, they said.Jerusalem is one of the world’s most fiercely contested swaths of real estate, with each side disputing the other’s claims. Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state, and most of the world considers it occupied territory. Jerusalem’s Old City has the third-holiest mosque in Islam and the holiest site in Judaism, making the city’s status a sensitive issue for Muslims and Jews alike. Jerusalem is also sacred ground to Christians.In addition to declining to take a position on the ultimate shape of Jerusalem, Mr. Trump called for the status quo on a disputed area of the Old City, known as the Temple Mount to Jews and the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims, which has been a flash point for tensions.Mr. Kushner and Jason D. Greenblatt, the president’s special envoy, have been working for months to prepare for a negotiation between Israelis and Palestinians. Though they have little to show for the effort publicly, they say they have made progress behind the scenes.Those efforts, Middle East experts said, would be jeopardized by Wednesday’s announcement. But Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt, the president’s special envoy, supported the president’s move, officials said.', 'For Trump, an Embassy in Jerusalem Is a Political Decision, Not a Diplomatic One - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — Ten days before Donald J. Trump took office, Sheldon G. Adelson went to Trump Tower for a private meeting. Afterward, Mr. Adelson, the casino billionaire and Republican donor, called an old friend, Morton A. Klein, to report that Mr. Trump told him that moving the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would be a major priority.“He was very excited, as was I,” said Mr. Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America, a hard-line pro-Israel group. “This is something that’s in his heart and soul.”The two men had to wait nearly a year, but on Wednesday, Mr. Trump stood beneath a portrait of George Washington to announce that he was formally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and setting in motion a plan to move the embassy to the fiercely contested Holy City.“While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise,” he said, “they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.”For Mr. Trump, the status of Jerusalem was always more a political imperative than a diplomatic dilemma. Faced with disappointing evangelical and pro-Israel backers like Mr. Adelson, or alarming allies and Arab leaders while jeopardizing his own peace initiative, the president sided with his key supporters.In doing so, Mr. Trump invited opprobrium from foreign leaders, who said the move was reckless and self-defeating. He also acted against the counsel of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who worried about anti-American blowback, not least to diplomats and troops serving overseas.Mr. Trump conceded the provocative nature of his decision. But as he has before, whether in pulling the United States from the Paris climate accord or disavowing the Iran nuclear deal, the president on Wednesday seemed to relish playing a familiar role: the political insurgent, defying foreign policy orthodoxy on behalf of the people who elected him.“People are waking up to the fact that the president doesn’t see grays and doesn’t like pastels,” said Christopher Ruddy, a conservative news media executive and friend of Mr. Trump’s. “He is very proud that he’s fulfilled so many campaign promises, and the embassy decision is another notch on his belt.”Mr. Trump’s handling of the embassy question was not unlike his handling of the nuclear deal with Iran, which he reluctantly certified the first time before disavowing it the second time the issue came up.Under a 1995 law, the president is required to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem unless, citing national security concerns, he signs a waiver, which has to be renewed every six months. The first time he faced that decision, in June, Mr. Trump grudgingly signed it.At the time, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is leading Mr. Trump’s peace initiative, argued that to move the embassy then might strangle the effort before the administration had established relationships in the region.Mr. Adelson and other pro-Israel backers were deeply frustrated. He pressed Mr. Trump on the issue at a private dinner in October at the White House that included his wife, Miriam, and Mr. Kushner. Mr. Adelson also vented to Stephen K. Bannon, then the president’s chief strategist, who argued internally for moving the embassy in June.The Adelsons have long been leading donors to pro-Israel groups and causes, and have forged a close relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They have used their casino fortune to push the Republican Party and its politicians to embrace that line.Early in Mr. Trump’s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he privately courted the Adelsons, seeking a meeting and asking for financial support, even as he publicly declared that he did not need or want backing from major donors.In March 2016, Mr. Trump sought to burnish his credentials as a friend of Israel, telling the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the most powerful pro-Israel lobbying group, “We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.”The Adelsons were persuaded and donated $20 million to a political action committee that supported Mr. Trump’s campaign, and another $1.5 million to the committee that organized the Republican convention.Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Adelson has communicated with him regularly, talking by phone and visiting the White House, and has used his access to push the relocation of the embassy. But he was not the only influential advocate of the move.Representatives of evangelical Christian groups similarly pressed the issue with Mr. Trump during the campaign, making it clear that moving the embassy was a major priority.“In the meetings I was in, it was clearly communicated that evangelicals and Bible-believing Christians see a special relationship with Israel,” said Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council.When the six-month clock expired again this month, Mr. Trump was determined to leave himself more options. On Nov. 27, he walked into a meeting of the principals’ committee of the National Security Council, as the officials were debating what to do about the embassy. His message, according to officials, was that he wanted more creative solutions.Mr. Trump’s advisers offered him two alternatives: Sign the waiver again, or sign it but recognize Jerusalem as the capital and set in motion a plan to move the embassy. Mr. Trump mulled the decision for several days, officials said, calling foreign leaders and lawmakers on Capitol Hill. And on Wednesday he announced he was taking the more aggressive approach, again signing the waiver but making it clear he would proceed with a move.His decision was supported by both Mr. Kushner and the president’s special envoy, Jason D. Greenblatt, who had concluded that shaking up the status quo could actually help rather than hurt their peace efforts.While they say they recognized that it would cause an immediate uproar — including potentially driving the Palestinians away from negotiations for some time — they believed the process was resilient enough to withstand the shock.Publicly, Mr. Tillerson has stood by the decision, while Mr. Mattis has been circumspect. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Mattis said: “We met in the room on this. It was an open discussion, went on for some time. As always, my advice to the president, I keep confidential.”A senior adviser to Mr. Tillerson, R. C. Hammond, told reporters that he did not oppose the move, but requested more time, when Mr. Trump’s decision was clear, to contact American diplomatic missions to determine their security needs if protests broke out.Amid all the warnings about violence, White House officials see a number of potential benefits to the move. Recognizing Jerusalem, officials said, could soothe the right flank of Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition government, stabilizing the political situation there.Also, the Saudi royal family has sharply criticized Mr. Trump’s decision, which some officials said could help the credibility of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman among his fellow Arabs. That could mitigate perceptions that the crown prince has grown too cozy with Mr. Kushner, with whom he has cultivated a close relationship.In his remarks at the White House, Mr. Trump did not dwell on how his decision might play out in the region. Rather, he cast it as a bold break with decades of failed policy on Jerusalem, which he said brought us “no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.”“It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result,” Mr. Trump said.Though he did not mention it, Mr. Trump signed the same waiver as his predecessors, Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for now. White House officials said that was unavoidable because it would take several years to move embassy employees to a new building in Jerusalem.In his speech, Mr. Trump pointed out that the 1995 law passed Congress with an overwhelming majority and was unanimously reaffirmed in the Senate six months ago. That may explain why the reaction to the move was comparatively muted on Capitol Hill.For Mr. Trump, the political benefits clearly outweigh the costs. The Republican Jewish Committee bought a full-page ad in The New York Times that is to be published on Thursday, depicting Mr. Trump praying at the Western Wall.“President Trump,” the slogan said, “You Promised. You Delivered.”To press its case with supporters, the White House convened two calls for religious leaders, one on Tuesday night to alert them to the coming announcement and a second, more detailed call on Wednesday.Most of the participants were from the evangelical Christian community and included Trump allies like Ralph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition; Robert Jeffress, a Dallas pastor who spoke at Mr. Trump’s private inaugural prayer service; and Mike Evans, a Christian Zionist who writes commentary on Middle Eastern issues.Among the questions they asked was how quickly the president would move the embassy. White House officials pleaded for patience. At the end of the call, according to a person who took part, a pastor and a rabbi closed with prayers.“Pray for the peace of Jerusalem,” the pastor said. “And thank God we have a president who would take this step.”', 'WASHINGTON – Defying dire, worldwide warnings, President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke with decades of U.S. and international policy and formally recognized Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital.Despite urgent appeals from Arab and European leaders and the risk of anti-American protests and violence, Trump declared it was time for a new approach to Mideast peace after decades of failure. Calling Jerusalem Israel\'s capital, he argued, was merely recognizing the obvious."We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past," the president said.He also said the U.S. would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable.Ahead of Trump\'s speech, a wide array of world leaders warned that his declaration could severely damage Arab-Israeli peace prospects in a region wracked by instability. They said recognizing Israel\'s claims to the city, however caveated, would infuriate Muslims and potentially spark protests and violence that might further fray American alliances.In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his nation was "profoundly grateful" and Trump\'s announcement was an "important step toward peace."However, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Wednesday that the U.S. shift "is a declaration of withdrawal from the role it has played in the peace process."In Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian protesters burned American and Israeli flags. They also waved Palestinian flags and banners proclaiming Jerusalem as their "eternal capital," language that Israelis similarly use. Even America\'s closest allies in Europe questioned the wisdom of Trump\'s departure from the past U.S. position, which was studiously neutral over the sovereignty of the city."I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel," Trump said in a White House address, calling his decision "overdue" and in America\'s best interests. "This is nothing more or less than the recognition of reality," he said.Trump made no reference to signing a waiver that officials said he would sign delaying any move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Establishing a Jerusalem embassy was a major campaign promise of Trump\'s and one that officials said he had focused on in discussions with top advisers in recent weeks. The waiver means there will be no embassy move for at least another six months.Instead, Trump stressed that he directed the State Department begin the process of moving the embassy as required by U.S. law, however many years that might take. After his speech, he signed a proclamation to that effect.The Trump administration has opted against an earlier plan of converting the existing U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem to an embassy, said a non-governmental expert on the Middle East who consults regularly with the White House. Instead, it\'s looking to construct an entirely new facility over the long term and a U.S. team is examining prospective sites in Jerusalem, said the individual, who wasn\'t authorized to disclose private conversations with U.S. officials and requested anonymity.There was little in Trump\'s statement to encourage the Palestinians. Although he recited the longstanding U.S. position that Jerusalem\'s borders must still be worked out through negotiation, he made no recognition of the Palestinian claims to east Jerusalem. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was expected to deliver a statement later Wednesday after consulting fellow Arab leaders.While Trump for the first time endorsed the concept of an independent Palestine existing alongside Israel, even that idea appeared conditional. He said he would promote the "two-state solution" if both sides agree. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\'s government is dominated by hardliners who oppose Palestinian independence.Trump\'s declaration of Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital is a powerful symbolic step. The United States has never endorsed the Jewish state\'s claim of sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem and has seen the city\'s future as indelibly linked to a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace agreement. Trump\'s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been trying to restart a new peace process.In making his decision, Trump overruled more cautious counsel from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, who expressed concern about endangering U.S. diplomats and troops in Muslim countries, according to officials briefed on internal administration deliberations. Those officials were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity."There will of course be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement — but we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a place of greater understanding and cooperation," Trump said. He said he intends "to do everything in my power to help forge" a peace agreement.Jerusalem includes the holiest ground in Judaism. It\'s also home to Islam\'s third-holiest shrine and major Christian sites, and any perceived harm to Muslim claims to the city has triggered protests in the past, in the Holy Land and beyond. On Tuesday, America\'s consulate in Jerusalem ordered U.S. personnel and their families to avoid visiting Jerusalem\'s Old City or the West Bank, and urged American citizens in general to stay away from places with increased police or military presence.Saudi Arabia\'s King Salman, one of several Arab leaders to speak to Trump this week, warned the U.S. leader Tuesday that declaring Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital "would constitute a flagrant provocation to all Muslims, all over the world." Abbas and Jordan\'s King Abdullah II said they told Trump specifically not to move the embassy. British Prime Minister Theresa May said she planned to call Trump to discuss her country\'s support for a two-state solution.Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian official, said Wednesday that Trump\'s recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital means "the peace process is finished" because Washington "has already pre-empted the outcome." Now, she said, "there is no way that there can be talks with the Americans."___Associated Press writers Josef Federman in Jerusalem; Karin Laub in Amman, Jordan; Josh Lederman in Brussels; Matthew Pennington and Bradley Klapper in Washington; Elaine Ganley in Paris; Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, and Aya Batrawy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.', 'President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a move that could spark increased tensions in the Middle East. President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital could incite extremists in the region -- making conditions "favorable to terrorism" against U.S. targets, Iraq\'s government warned Thursday.Iraqi leaders in Baghdad called for Trump to reverse his decision, saying that it could threaten stability in the Middle East.“We caution against the dangerous repercussions of this decision on the stability of the region and the world,” the government\'s statement said.An Iran-backed militia operating in Iraq echoed Baghdad\'s statement, saying Trump’s "stupid decision" would be a “legitimate reason” to attack U.S. troops in Iraq, Reuters reported.“Trump’s stupid decision to make Jerusalem a capital for the Zionist will be the big spark for removing this entity from the body of the Islamic nation, and a legitimate reason to target American forces,” said Akram al-Kaabi, the group\'s leader.The militia, Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, is composed of some 10,000 Iraqi fighters under an umbrella of Iran-backed Shi’ite militias.Iraq has also summoned the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad and plans to hand over a memo protesting the new policy, Reuters reported.Meanwhile, the Palestinian group Hamas -- recognized as terrorists by the U.S. -- threatened its own retaliation against Israel following Trump\'s declaration of the new U.S. policy, a separate Reuters report said. "We should call for and we should work on launching an intifada in the face of the Zionist enemy," Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a speech in Gaza."The U.S. decision is an aggression, a declaration of war on us, on the best Muslim and Christian shrines in the heart of Palestine, Jerusalem."Hamas has fought three wars with Israel since 2007."We have given instruction to all Hamas members and to all its wings to be fully ready for any new instructions or orders that may be given to confront this strategic danger that threatens Jerusalem and threatens Palestine," Haniyeh added.Trump announced Wednesday that the U.S. would formally recognized Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital, saying it\'s time to "acknowledge the obvious" as he ordered the State Department to begin moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.', "Conor Powell reports on the high-stakes decision being debated in the White House.U.S. Marine Corps Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams (FAST) have bolstered security across “several” U.S. embassies in the Middle East ahead of the expected announcement Wednesday by President Donald Trump about moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem — as well as mulling whether to recognize Jerusalem officially as the Israeli capital.Israeli security officials say they're also preparing for a potential outbreak of violence. “We understand that in any moment the order that we have achieved could change,” said Jerusalem District Police CommanderMajor Gen. Yoram Halvy about the potential outbreak of violence with moving the U.S. Embassy to the holy city. “Any second this place could be set on fire.”Jerusalem’s status long has been a flash point in the Arab-Israeli conflict, with both Palestinians and Israelis claiming the city as their capital. In 1995, Congress passed a law recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, but allowed U.S. presidents to sign a six-month waiver postponing the move to entice both Israeli and Palestinians to the negotiating table.WHY TRUMP’S PROMISE TO MOVE US EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM IS SO CONTROVERSIALOn Tuesday, Palestinian leaders said that if Trump recognized Jerusalem, as he has promised to do, the move would end U.S.-led peace efforts.“If Mr. Trump recognizes Jerusalem, he will destroy any chance of the deal of the century,” Dr. Nabil Shaath, an adviser to Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas, said referring to Trump’s vow to reach a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians.Shaath said Palestinians would continue to work with other countries toward a two-state solution.ERDOGAN: RECOGNIZING JERUSALEM AS ISRAEL’S CAPITAL IS ‘RED LINE’ FOR MUSLIMSArab and European leaders also have pushed the Trump administration to resume peace negotiations. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah political party has called for daily protests marches this week.With the threat of a violent Palestinian reaction, Israel’s police and military commanders have been meeting to evaluate the potential for escalation.Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.Conor Powell joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in 2009 and serves as a Jerusalem-based foreign correspondent.", 'President Trump has promised to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in Israel. Here\'s why the move would be deemed both controversial and historic.JERUSALEM – An umbrella organization of Muslim countries says President Donald Trump\'s possible recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital would constitute "naked aggression" against the Arab and Muslim world, while the ruling Palestinian party has called for mass protests against such a move by Washington.The Organization for Islamic Cooperation issued a statement Monday saying its 57 member states should sever ties with any state that transfers its embassy to Jerusalem or recognizes Israel\'s annexation of east Jerusalem.Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, but the international community doesn\'t recognize its sovereignty over it. Palestinians claim it as the capital of their hoped-for state.U.S. officials said Trump may recognize Jerusalem as Israel\'s capital this week. He had promised to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem during his campaign.', 'President declines to recertify rogue regime\'s compliance with 2015 nuclear deal; Foundation for Defense of Democracies\' Mark Dubowitz reacts.When the Iranian parliament chanted “death to America" while unanimously voting "to increase spending on its ballistic missile program and the foreign operations of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard," sophisticated diplomats may have pondered the symbolic meaning of "death to America."After all, our wisest and most sophisticated analysts have reassured us, it couldn\'t literally mean "death to America." The New York Times has been on a campaign to convince Americans the phrase has lost its original meaning.Here are examples from 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017.The same analysts reassure us that when senior Hamas leaders are quoted saying "not a single Jew will remain" in Israel, they are really communicating symbolically.As a historian, I am always amazed at the sophistry of well-educated establishments that hide from reality through the use of convoluted thinking and clever language.In my experience, dictators and revolutionary movements mean exactly what they say. In this case, the Iranians would like to destroy both America and Israel.Thankfully, President Trump understands this reality better than many so-called experts.The president did exactly the right thing Friday when he announced that he would renew sanctions on the Iranian regime and decline to certify the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (also known as the Iran Deal) negotiated by President Obama.President Trump has previously referred to the deal as “an embarrassment to the United States,” and called it “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.”Since he was a candidate, the President understood that America is today with the Iranian dictatorship where it was in 1994 with the North Korean dictatorship. We now know that during 23 years of talking, posturing, and diplomatic maneuvering, the North Koreans simply kept building their nuclear weapon and missile programs.As the president said Friday "History has shown that the longer we ignore a threat, the more dangerous that threat becomes."The president saw that we are today faced with the same choice with Iran that we had in North Korea in 1994. He decided to show the courage to tell the truth and act on it.This will be a big surprise to Iran – and North Korea. Having been conditioned by eight years of President Obama to assume that America will always posture and then cave, neither of these rogue nations knows how to deal with a super power that is serious.The weaknesses of the Obama agreement with Iran are simply symptoms of the weakness and self-delusion behind the entire Obama team approach to the Iranian dictatorship and its revolutionary terrorist strategies.Iran has proved that appeasement and negotiation fail time and again.Starting in 1979, when Ayatollah Khomeini established a religious dictatorship that exported terror and saw itself at war with America (\'the Great Satan") and Israel ("the Little Satan"), American policy became increasingly hostile to the regime.During the 1979-1981 Iranian hostage crisis, which was itself a total violation of international law, the Jimmy Carter Administration attempted a rational negotiating strategy. It was completely rejected by the mullahs.During the Reagan administration in 1983, truck bombs driven by Iranian-sponsored operatives killed 241 U.S. service personnel (220 marine and 21 other personnel) and 58 French paratroopers in Lebanon, and the United States quietly helped the Iraqis with intelligence and military equipment in their war with Iran.From 1987 to 1988 the United States provided naval support to help Kuwaiti tankers get through the straits of Hormuz. In that process, the Iranians tried to mine the Persian Gulf, and an American warship shot down an Iranian airliner it thought was on a dangerous course.Throughout the period of 1979 to 2008, the United States had a consistent policy of containing the Iranian dictatorship. It was clear that Iranians killed 19 Americans with a bomb at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. Iran was consistently labeled the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world by every administration (including Obama’s).President George W. Bush identified the Iranian dictatorship, along with Iraq and North Korea, as part of an "Axis of Evil." During our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan the Iranians worked hard to establish their own zones of influence.However, When President Obama came into office, nearly 30 years of hostility was replaced by a new vision of developing a relationship with the Iranian dictatorship. This is the delusional fantasy that has allowed Iran to dominate much of the Middle East, especially after Iraq was weakened by war. It also emboldened Iran.Even after President Trump’s historic and amazing United Nations speech when he condemned the JCPOA and said Iran is a "reckless regime – one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room," the Iranians responded by building more missiles.Consider this report by Reuters titled "Defying Trump, Iran says will boost missile capabilities”:“Iran will strengthen its missile capabilities and not seek any country’s permission, President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday rejecting demands from U.S. President Donald Trump.“Rouhani spoke at a military parade where an Iranian news agency said one of the weapons on display was a new ballistic missile with range of 1,200 miles, capable of carrying several warheads. …“In a speech broadcast on state television, Rouhani said: ‘We will increase our military power as a deterrent. We will strengthen our missile capabilities ... We will not seek permission from anyone to defend our country.’”For those who wonder how big the Iranian missile program is, AP reported that, “Brigadier General Hossein Salami of the Revolutionary Guard boasted that ‘the rate of our missile production is so high that we are faced with the problem of space’ to keep them in.”President Trump also realizes his administration must not consider the JCPOA in isolation.The failure of the JCPOA is simply one component of a disastrous Obama policy which has enabled Iran to break out and begin to develop a hegemonic position across Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon (with a dangerous extension to Gaza).For instance, Iranians have been desperate to build a land corridor to connect with Lebanon since the Reagan Administration was dueling with the Iranian-sponsored terrorists there. Obama\'s myopic policy of focusing only on the JCPOA gave Iran the opportunity it needed to gain that corridor.As a result, we are currently faced with preparations for war on a scale the Middle East has not seen since the Yom Kippur War in 1973.Hezbollah, the Iranian front group in South Lebanon, has more than 100,000 missiles that can be fired into Israel. As though that isn\'t enough of a threat, the Iranians plan to build missile factories in Syria and Lebanon. In addition, they are talking about developing an Iranian port in Lebanon.The weakness and confusion America has shown in Syria has created a Russian-Iranian-Assad-Hezbollah alliance that will push the threat to Israel to a totally new and dangerous level.Flush with money from Obama (including an airplane full of cash flown in like a drug cartel run), Iran has funded a proxy war in Yemen against the Saudis. More Iranian money has been sent to prop up Hamas after the various Sunni funders began to cut them off.On every front, Iran is a dangerous nation seeking to build up its capacity to wage war, project power, and intimidate its neighbors.Meanwhile, the JCPOA is another absurdity that illustrates how weak the Obama team was and how eager its members were to get an Iranian agreement to "something."Congress should move forward with initiatives to strengthen it.Under the current agreement, the Iranians have reserved the right to keep their military installations secret. Thus, international inspectors can look for violations anywhere except on military facilities. This means the inspections can have no validity, because inspectors will never know what they are not allowed to see.Finally, the United Nations agreement limiting Iranian missile development is being blatantly and publicly violated. That strikes at the very heart of the Corker-Cardin requirement that Iran must be fully implementing the related agreements. Iran\'s failed launch of a missile in January (which was based on North Korean designs) and its faked launch in September, are a blatant violations of the agreement.The terms of the Corker-Cardin “Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act” (INARA/ PL 114-17) require the president to certify Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA every 90 days.Full compliance under this law requires the United States to certify that: (1) Iran is fully implementing the JCPOA and all related agreements; (2) Iran has not committed (or if committed, has cured) a material breach; (3) Iran has taken no action to significantly advance its nuclear weapons program; and (4) that continued suspension of nuclear-related sanctions is both appropriate and vital to our national security interests.It is impossible to argue that criterion four has been met when Iran\'s behavior in its totality is taken into account. This is exactly the logic the president followed on Friday.How can you take President Trump\'s strong, clear denunciation of the dictatorship and argue that continued suspension of sanctions on Iran is both appropriate and vital to our national interest? It’s impossible.Unlike President Obama, whose posture was all talk and no action, President Trump has begun to establish a pattern of taking real actions, creating real pressures, and insisting on real results.President Trump’s decision to decertify is a clear and forceful articulation of the comprehensive Trump policy toward Iran.However, he didn’t come to this decision alone. The President spent months working with his Cabinet to make this decision. Confronting the totality of the Iranian threat, while remaining in the JCPOA with an eye toward improving it, substantially reflects the influence of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. In helping shape a new Iran policy that better provides for America’s security interests, Tillerson has proved to be an able advisor to the president, and has de-bunked media myths about a Trump-Tillerson rift in the process.The administration should continue to oppose Iran\'s aggression in the region and seek to eliminate the fundamental flaws of the nuclear deal (starting with the sunset clauses).As United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley made clear in her recent speech at the American Enterprise Institute, certification and the US continuation of the JCPOA are two separate decisions. Decertification leaves the President with continued flexibility and a number of options. In fact, decertification will increase the Administration\'s leverage to fix the nuclear deal by clarifying that the US will not be satisfied to remain indefinitely in an agreement that is not in our national security interests.Conversely, signing recertification would have undermined every strong signal we have sent about the Iranian dictatorship. They would interpret it as America flinching and pulling back. It would have made the President’s powerful indictment of Iran and North Korea at the United Nations seem hollow.President Trump’s decisive refusal to recertify the JCPOA has drawn a line and communicated clearly that the rollback of Iranian influence has begun. It was a brave and historically necessary step.Newt Gingrich is a Fox News contributor. A Republican, he was speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 1999.

His latest book is "Understanding Trump."', '', 'Confederate Flags With Cotton Found on American University Campus - The New York TimesTen Confederate flag posters with cotton attached to them were discovered on the campus of American University on Tuesday evening, according to a statement posted by the school.The posters, with imagery that evoked slavery, were found the same evening that the school introduced its Anti-Racist Research and Policy Center. The university’s vice president of campus life, Fanta Aw, drew a link between that presentation, delivered by the center’s founding director, Ibram Kendi, and the fliers.“AU is committed to the vision of the center and Dr. Kendi’s work and we will not be deterred by this cowardly attempt at intimidation,” she said in a statement, adding that the university and campus police had opened an investigation.The university’s president, Sylvia M. Burwell, said Wednesday that video images had captured a suspect hanging the posters on bulletin boards in at least four campus buildings.The suspect captured on video is a white male, the university police said, describing him as approximately 40 years old and about 5’10. An image from the video shows him in a construction worker’s hat and vest, wearing white gloves and carrying what appears to be a tool case.“We must stand together strongly against this act, which was intended to frighten and divide our community,” Ms. Burwell said.The posters included images of the Confederate battle flag, as well as the words “Huzzah for Dixie” and “I wish I was in the land of cotton,” a lyric from the song “Dixie,” something of an unofficial anthem for the Confederacy.They appeared to be posted on bulletin boards for specific programs, including boards dedicated to the Center for Israel Studies and to American Studies month, as well as one outside the university’s center for diversity and inclusion. Ms. Burwell said that the posters were found in four separate buildings on the university’s Washington campus.Dr. Kendi, a historian and author who joined the university this year, released a separate statement in which he tried to comfort students, “especially students of color and Jewish students, who may be feeling yet another rush of fear from tonight’s posters.”“I want you to know that you are a model of triumph,” he wrote. “And when you triumph you become a threat to people who would rather you fail.”He continued, “If they can’t keep you down by discrimination, then they have attempted to keep you down by terror, by instilling fear in you, in me.”This is at least the second time this year that racist symbols were discovered on the school’s campus. In May, bananas were found hanging from nooses on campus the same day that a student, Taylor Dumpson, became the first black woman elected student body president. The F.B.I. said at the time that it was helping the university investigate.Ms. Dumpson and other student government leaders released a statement Tuesday, calling the Confederate posters “horrifying.”“The significance of this occurring as our country continues to struggle with its history of white supremacy also cannot be ignored,” they said, expressing their support for the investigation “to bring whoever committed this act to justice.”A public conversation about what happened will be held at the university Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Burwell said.“I ask you to join me in standing together and show that we will not be intimidated,” she said. “AU will respond strongly to attempts designed to harm and create fear. Instead, we will recommit to creating a community that does not stand by. When one of us is attacked, all of us are attacked.”', 'Celebrations across northern Iraq as people voted on Kurdish independence, perhaps paving the way for the creation of a new country; Benjamin Hall reports from Irbil, IraqERBIL, Iraq – ISIS is still dangerous in parts of Iraq – and in Kiruk, they’re just across from the Kurdish frontlines. But on Tuesday, Kurdish soldiers are preparing to defend against a very different threat – Baghdad. One day after the referendum, which saw an over 70 percent turnout, and around 3.3 million people vote in a resounding yes, soldiers manning those lines, told Fox News proudly that this frontline was the new Kurdish border.“Be assured we will stay in these trenches – whether it’s the militias, or ISIS or the Iraqi army who come – this is our border. We will never leave,” said Mofaq Borhan Ibrahim, a first lieutenant in the Peshmerga forces.IRAQI KURDS CELEBRATE ON THE STREETS AFTER CASTING VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCEBut on Tuesday, the governor of disputed, oil-rich Kirkuk, Dr.Najmaldin Karim,as well as other Kurdish politicians, tried to downplay that.But every soldier I spoke to believes it is. To them, this is their land – they’ve fought for it and many have died for it. And now two U.S. allies are sitting on a tinderbox that could erupt into a full blown conflict.WHAT’S NEXT AFTER IRAQI KURDS VOTE ON INDEPENDENCETurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country is considering all options, ranging from military intervention to economic sanctions against Iraq\'s Kurdish region.He added that the landlocked Iraqi Kurdish region would not be able to survive without Turkey\'s support.The Turkish leader said no country other than Israel supports the Iraqi Kurdish referendum on independence, which he described as "invalid" and "fraudulent" and said attempts by Kurds to form an independent state are doomed to fail.“We are not looking for war,” Karim said. “But the Peshmerga will defend the city under any circumstances”', 'Now Is the Time to Talk About Guns - The New York TimesThis article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox.If you are heartbroken about the latest mass shooting and tired of how frequent such shootings have become, don’t let anyone intimidate you from talking about gun safety now. It’s the right time to do so, and it will remain the right time until we’ve made progress in dealing with this problem. It’s entirely possible to do so.Here are five pieces I recommend in the wake of the Las Vegas horror. I’m still trying to fathom the toll — at least 59 dead and 527 wounded.1. “There is a right way to ‘politicize’ mass shootings, and a wrong way to politicize them,” writes Greg Sargent of The Plum Line. The wrong way is to focus on the shooter’s ideology (and Sargent wrote his piece before almost anything was known about this shooter).The right way is to start “intense arguments over how to prevent” future shootings, Sargent writes. He also urges people to be clear about whether they’re trying to prevent overall gun deaths or mass shootings, which represent just a tiny fraction of gun deaths.2. My colleague Nick Kristof: “in every other sphere, we at least use safety regulations to try — however imperfectly — to reduce death and injury.” Kristof makes eight specific suggestions that he thinks have the potential to reduce gun deaths by nearly one-third.“Since 1970, more Americans have died from guns (including suicides, murders and accidents) than the sum total of all the Americans who died in all the wars in American history, back to the American Revolution,” he writes.The Upshot also has a chart ranking potential regulations by their predicted effectiveness.3. “More guns mean more gun deaths. Period,” writes Vox’s German Lopez. Just look at the charts he cites comparing the number of guns and gun deaths in the United States and elsewhere — or the chart comparing various states within this country. If you prefer this information in video form, here you go.4. New York Magazine’s Lisa Miller wrote last year about an “experiment in radical empathy,” in which Americans on different sides of the gun debate sat down to talk with each other. In some ways, the experiment worked; in others, it did not. But Miller’s piece raises some ideas about how to make progress.5. One person who has changed his mind: Caleb Keeter, a country guitarist who performed at the Las Vegas venue hours before the shooting. “I’ve been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life. Until the events of last night,” he wrote on Twitter. “Enough is enough.”In The Times: Nevada is “an open-carry state with a Wild West past of loose gun laws and regulations,” writes Brittany Bronson, who works on the Las Vegas Strip.Steve Israel, a former Democratic congressman from New York, argues that partisanship and public apathy mean that nothing about America’s gun policies will change.And the Editorial Board offers a calendar cataloging every mass shooting since the Orlando nightclub massacre.', '                                    Rescue officials have deployed dogs to help them find bodies stuck in the rubble after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked Mexico on Tuesday, Sept. 19, 2017.

Pixar’s “Coco” won best animated film, and the Jane Goodall biopic “Jane” landed best documentary.Another stop on the seasonal circuit, the National Board of Review prizes are loosely predictive of Academy Award nominees and winners, and yet another indicator of where the winds are blowing. Last year, board winners Casey Affleck and Kenneth Lonergan went on to nab Oscars; the board also named ”O.J.: Made in America” best documentary and “The Salesman” best foreign-language film, foreshadowing those Oscar wins as well.The NBR Awards Gala will be held Jan. 9 at Cipriani 42nd Street.Here is the full list of winners:Best Film: “The Post”Best Director: Greta Gerwig, “Lady Bird”Best Actor: Tom Hanks, “The Post”Best Actress: Meryl Streep, “The Post”Best Supporting Actor: Willem Dafoe, “The Florida Project”Best Supporting Actress: Laurie Metcalf, “Lady Bird”Best Original Screenplay: Paul Thomas Anderson, “Phantom Thread”Best Adapted Screenplay: Scott Neustadter and Michael H.

Class differences, she said, play a bigger role in making outsiders feel alienated in the United Kingdom than in the United States, but “the result is the same.”Over the past year or so in the United States, one accusation of sexual harassment and gender bias in one high-profile company has barely died down before another pops up. Susan Fowler, an Uber employee, wrote a blog post in February about harassment and retaliation that landed like dynamite; after investigations and more revelations, Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, left the company.At Google, a software engineer was fired after writing a memo that argued that biological differences — such as women experiencing higher levels of anxiety and less tolerance for stress — explained why there were fewer women in top engineering and leadership position at the company. And at the end of September, Dave McClue, the founder of the company 500 Start-ups, said he was stepping down after The New York Times reported he had made an advance to a woman who was applying for a job at his firm.One of the biggest cases involved Ellen Pao, who sued her venture capital firm alleging gender discrimination and lost the case in 2015. She is back in the news with a book, “Reset,” about her experiences.And, of course, there is the inevitable backlash. James Altizer, 52, an engineer at the chip maker Nvidia, declared in a recent Times article that “feminists in Silicon Valley had formed a cabal whose goal was to subjugate men.” He called the firing of some male employees in tech companies “a witch hunt,” and said there were a growing number of men across Silicon Valley and elsewhere who felt as he did.While American companies are primarily the ones in the spotlight, they have a global reach, not just because of their size, but because of the ways their actions resonate around the world. And even if gender issues elsewhere don’t make headlines, women on both sides of the Atlantic point to similar problems — although political and cultural disparities create different challenges and opportunities.For example, while being a working mother, especially in high-powered technology fields, can be difficult, the paid maternity leaves and state-subsidized child care available in many European countries make life simpler.Karoli Hindriks, 34, of Estonia, started her first company when she was 16. At 19, she spoke before the European Parliament about young entrepreneurs. And she didn’t consider herself a feminist.“I thought, if you’re good enough, you’ll get the position,” she said. Then, she was propositioned by a possible investor. Writing about the episode in her blog, she described it as “the most humiliating situation imaginable.” She also said that when she was applying for an accelerator program for the company she currently heads,  Jobbatical, she was told she should leave the fact that she had a child off the application. (Jobbatical matches global companies and job-seekers in technology, business and creative fields.)“I was very full of myself when younger,” she said. “It has been eye-opening.”But one thing making her life easier is “that the state is supporting family so strongly,” Ms. Hindriks said. “We have 18 months’ paid paternity and maternity leave. Preschool costs nothing. Taking care of a child is not an issue.”Geraldine Le Meur, 45, moved from Paris to San Francisco a decade ago to be, as she put it, “in the center of the jet engine. It was and is the place to be when you are in the digital and tech space.”One the biggest cultural differences she found is how surprised people were that, as a mother of three, she opted to work full-time.“It was almost shocking to people that I continue working rather than stay at home with the boys,” said Ms. Le Meur, who started the Refiners, a San Francisco-based seed fund program to help foreign tech start-ups go global. “It wouldn’t be the same in France; it wouldn’t be that surprising.” And she also attributes the differing attitudes to state-subsidized day care and to an earlier starting age for school – 3 years old rather than 5 in the United States.“You know that the people taking care of your babies while you work are professionals,” she said. “I see friends here who have little kids who are super-conflicted. If they’re financially well-off, it doesn’t seem right not to take care of the kids yourself. My kids are the best part of my life, but not the only part.”Shira Kaplan, 34, who moved with her husband from Israel to Zurich for his job, found that the message about combining motherhood and work was very different in Switzerland than in her native Israel. She served in the elite cybersecurity intelligence unit in the Israeli military, but when she became pregnant with her first child while working at a private Swiss bank, she said she was constantly asked: “ ‘Are you coming back? Are you coming back 100 percent?’ In the end, they restructured my team while I was on maternity leave and it was a very strong signal.”She then started and now runs Cyverse, a firm that brings Israeli cybersecurity expertise to Europe. Yet, even as the industry is increasingly eager to show diversity by bringing on women — “we’re the new hot thing” — she still feels different, not just about being a woman, but a young woman, she said.In Israel, perhaps because military service is mandatory for women and men, there is a greater sense of equality, she said, and there are more women entrepreneurs in technology. In Switzerland, walking into a technology conference, “almost everyone one around you is a gray-haired male in a suit,” she said. “It’s difficult, because when doing business with someone, you look for something in common, and we’re asymmetrical — ‘I’m young, they’re old, I’m a woman, they’re male, I’m short they’re tall.’ ”Ms. Imafidon, 28, agreed. “I’m young, a person of color, a woman and I talk like a person from East London — you could discriminate against me for a number of reasons.”She said she hasn’t experienced much gender bias, probably because, she said, she is very confident and not especially perceptive about what other people think of her. At 20 she was one of the youngest people ever to be awarded a master’s degree in mathematics and computer science by the University of Oxford, and in 2013 the British Computer Society, a professional organization, named her its young information technology professional of the year.But she is worried about the small number of young women entering the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, collectively known as STEM, and the messages they’re getting about women in technology.Her concern led her to start  Stemettes, which offers workshops, classes and summer programs designed to expose all girls and young women to science, technology and engineering. For example, at a recent event, 60 girls ages 5 through 19 showed up to build their own apps.The different educational systems in the United States and Britain mean that each has its own strengths and weaknesses when teaching STEM, she said; British schools, unlike schools in the United States, have a national curriculum; STEM teaching in the United States, on the other hand, “might be more patchy, but it can also be more creative.”Vanessa Evers, a professor of computer science at the University of Twente in the Netherlands who was a visiting scholar at Stanford University and who worked for Boston Consulting Group in London, said the United States offers more women role models in technology and science than her country does. “In America, it is easier to find support,” said Prof. Evers, who specializes in human-computer interactions. “I had women mentors who were willing to allow me to be there to observe and come along to important meetings. I learned so much just from being there. It’s not so common here — there’s more of a class system, a sense that ‘you don’t crash the party.’”She feels, she said, a “basic condescension” as a woman in tech. “I feel I have to convince them that I know the technology, and they’re surprised when I do.”Prof. Evers has had her share of inappropriate remarks and experiences, she said. One time, a more senior male colleague was interested in whether she shaved her armpits and pulled at her shirt to take a look.“Two years ago, I would never have talked about it; it’s not easy to do when you’re still in the running for senior positions,” she said. But over the past few years, she has been more outspoken.“I wasn’t willing to show what I saw as my weak side before,” she said. “I want to display a persona at work that is super capable, but that is selfish.”After all, as she and others said, it’s not just about filling the pipeline by encouraging women to enter STEM fields, but making sure that women who already in it are treated well and promoted.Jean Bennington Sweeney, the chief sustainability officer and vice president of corporate social responsibility for 3M, is now based in Minnesota at the company headquarters. But she meets often with European counterparts and used to be based in Australia and Taiwan.“What I see in Europe and the U.S. is lots of encouragement for girls in STEM. It’s not where it needs to be, but I do see more encouragement in schools and even in families,” she said. Through mentoring and tutoring, she does her part to try to get more young women to enter the STEM field.In Asia, in general, “while things are improving, the bosses are still older men and may be less willing to accept” young women as engineers, Ms. Sweeney said. “It’s more like it was 20 to 30 years ago in the U.S.” And it is women with more financial means, she said, who can more easily break through the gender barrier.In Singapore, more and more women are running successful tech companies or start-ups, said Jacqueline Poh, chief executive of the Government Technology Agency of Singapore, adding that “a significant proportion” of top executives in the country’s tech companies are women. Government initiatives have also focused on teaching coding and computer skills to students at all levels.Nonetheless, she said, “I strongly believe that female representation in tech could definitely be higher. I think the general resistance could stem from preconceived notions that a career in tech would only revolve around programming.”Ms. Sweeney said all women in all countries also have to move away from the idea that they “have to be super smart to be in science and engineering. It’s not just for the best and the brightest,” she said. “Boys and men assume that if they are 30 to 40 percent qualified, they’ll go for it. Girls and women feel they need to be 80 percent qualified to attempt it. We have to get past the idea that you need to be exceptional, not just good. Believe me, the men aren’t all exceptional.”', 'Colin Farrell and the Art of the Small Comeback - The New York TimesLONDON — Thirteen years ago, after receiving the worst critical thrashing of his life for the film “Alexander,” the Irish actor Colin Farrell came up with what he felt was a brilliant plan to cope with the humiliation.“Where can I wear a ski mask and not actually be put against the wall by a bunch of SWAT cops?” he recalls asking himself.The answer: Lake Tahoe, where Mr. Farrell spent the next few days masked and drunk, and fighting the urge to apologize to potential moviegoers for wasting their money and time. No anecdote fully captures a person’s complexities, but this one helps explain the widespread fondness for Mr. Farrell. A sensitive scoundrel is hard to resist, especially a movie star with the wherewithal to admit that a public excoriation was, in the end, a good thing.“I was due a kick in the arse. I really, really was,” Mr. Farrell, 41, said during a recent interview here. “Because I was annoying. I had so much, so quick. I was so cocksure.”Mr. Farrell has undergone a metamorphosis since then, and continues to shape shift. A decade ago, he was playing the generic action hero, or trying to, but the big movie star suit was not a good fit — for his films, or for him. He drew middling reviews and cemented a reputation as a badly behaved bed hopper with an insatiable appetite for alcohol and drugs. After finally flaming out, he entered rehab the moment his last big film, the 2006 “Miami Vice,” wrapped.But rather than lick his wounds or hold out to come back big, Mr. Farrell came back soulful and small, turning in performances in the 2008 indie “In Bruges” and the low-budget “Crazy Heart” that drew accolades. Lest anyone get too comfortable, Mr. Farrell has veered sharply left again, into rigorous art house territory, starring in the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos’s “The Lobster,” from 2015, and now “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” which opened Oct 20. One is about people who get forcibly changed into animals if they don’t find a romantic partner. The other is about a husband and father who might have to kill a family member after apparently being put under an evil spell. Not exactly the type of fare one would expect from a guy who played Sonny Crockett.But with the two films, Mr. Farrell put in the most deadpan performances of his career and landed some of his best reviews. This career arc, and the reaction to it, has surprised even him. During production of “The Lobster,” which earned him a Golden Globe nomination, he remembers telling his co-star Rachel Weisz that he hadn’t a clue what he was doing.“I said, ‘It’s the most boring performance that will ever be put on film. Ever.’ It was just so dull,” Mr. Farrell said. He acknowledged that his very appearance in Mr. Lanthimos’s work has a strong measure of who-woulda-thunk-it. But, he said, given the sheer oddness of both stories, “it’s actually very unusual for anyone to do.”Mr. Farrell met to chat in the cocktail lounge of his hotel near Piccadilly Circus, where he has been staying while filming Disney’s live-action “Dumbo,” directed by Tim Burton. He is slim and, at 5-foot-10, taller than expected, with features that remain boyish and eyebrows ever swarthy. Lively and engaged, he is a warm Irish wit and could charm a nun out of her habit. He is also disarmingly open. Mr. Farrell freely recounted his adventures with wine, women, drugs and porn early in his career, and even now, with double-digit years of sobriety, he’ll go on about inadvertent overzealous manscaping and the terrors of first-time sober sex.In London, he was fighting fatigue. He has spent most of the past year on film sets, and was aching to be back home in Los Angeles with his sons, aged 14 and 8.“I say this as someone who is really aware of how fortunate I am. The world’s smallest violin should not play for me,” he said. “I’m just ready to step away from all of it. I really just want to go on a hike and see my boys and go on a road trip.”Before “Dumbo,” which he said he liked working on very much — “there’s fire eaters and guys walking on balls and trapeze artists and Tim Burton running around with a stick. It’s genius” – Mr. Farrell was in Chicago filming “Widows” with Steve McQueen, and before that working on “Roman J. Israel, Esq.,” with Denzel Washington. And before that was “The Beguiled,” with Sofia Coppola, and “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” which was shot last summer in Cincinnati and, of Mr. Farrell’s recent films, has perhaps affected him the most.Written by Mr. Lanthimos with Efthymis Filippou, the film is far darker than “The Lobster,” and suffused with an increasingly claustrophobic dread. Mr. Farrell adopted a monotone for the part similar to that of his “Lobster” role, but the characters’ similarity ends there.David, his “Lobster” character, was doughy, inward, guileless and desperately lonely, all of which felt especially poignant coming from a live wire like Mr. Farrell, who said he felt great liberation in being so contained. “There was no attempt and no desire, as written, to be in any way cool, any way interesting, any way suave,” he said. But Steven, the heart surgeon he played in “Killing,” is cunning and arrogant, and by the end of the production, Mr. Farrell said, he felt very depressed.He was drawn to the part by the same tug that drew him to “The Lobster,” finding brilliance in the twisted worlds Mr. Lanthimos creates. And in Mr. Farrell, Mr. Lanthimos said he found a true creative partner.“It’s a gift to have that kind of relationship, it’s easier to go further and explore other things,” Mr. Lanthimos said. “This was a challenge, something more different and complex and dark, and I knew he had the understanding and tone.”For all his work on big films, Mr. Farrell has long preferred smaller films anyway and the specific stories they can tell. When Martin McDonagh approached him to play a hit man for “In Bruges,” basically throwing him a lifeline, he almost turned down the part. He’d been in a string of bad movies and was still feeling the lingering burn of his Alexander the Great movie. (Among the sharper barbs: “He seems like a moody sad sack that I wouldn’t follow to the grocery store much less into battle.”) He worried his name might scare people away.Mr. McDonagh persuaded him anyway. “The character needed to be lovable and appealing even though he’s done something horrific and unforgivable, and it’s easy to love Colin, and to believe that sense of guilt he showed so well,” Mr. McDonagh wrote by email. “Also, I don’t think he ever really didn’t want to do the part for a second!”For Mr. Farrell, it was a shaky time. He was scant months out of rehab, having finally caved to his family’s pressures to get straight. Asked what hastened his bottoming out, Mr. Farrell quipped, “Just existing.” But really, he added, it was the intensity of sudden fame, which came fast after Joel Schumacher cast him in “Tigerland” (2000) and then “Phone Booth” (2002).“Getting all these platitudes and things being said about you, and all these gifts, it wasn’t in my DNA to believe any of this stuff,” he said. “You try and match the hype, but I never believed it.”Mr. Farrell is from Castleknock, a relatively well-to-do Dublin suburb, and studied at the Gaiety School of Acting in Dublin before landing a role in 1998 on the BBC soap “Ballykissangel.” He took the Irish national commandment of not getting ahead of yourself to Hollywood, “foolishly and understandably,” he now says, equating personal change with betraying his roots.“I remember making a promise to myself, ‘Don’t change, don’t change, remember where you come from,’” he said. “But change is inevitable. You don’t change, you get sickness, your life will fall apart on the inside.”His antics filled gossip pages, but he swears many of them were lost to blackouts. I asked about the time he kissed a reporter on camera on the red carpet, and his eyes widened. “Did I? Who? Which one?” he asked. “I swear to God, I lost so much time.” A little while later, a button on my blouse popped, and as I quickly refastened it, he steadfastly held my gaze, and then pointed to his eyes. “I kept right here, the whole time,” he teased. “Back in the day I would’ve leaned in for a kiss, obviously.”The exchange was light and playful, and the interview took place before The New York Times published its exposé on the producer Harvey Weinstein, whose reported sexual misconduct Mr. Farrell would later denounce as “atrocious.” In our chat, though, Mr. Farrell did address the latitude given to stars.“The one thing that fame asks you to do, I have learned, is to police yourself,” he said. “You get away with murder, you get away with mistreating people, you won’t be called out on things you really should be called out with, you really do.”He was glad that those days were behind him, he said, not least because sobriety has made him a much better dad. His first son, James Padraig, was born in 2003 (James’s mother is the model Kim Bordenave), and initially Mr. Farrell figured he’d be his son’s friend. “’Cause that’s what a 6-month-old grub needs,” he cracked, “a 27-year-old drunk, high friend.” He had his second son, Henry, with his former girlfriend the actress Alicja Bachleda-Curus. Mr. Farrell shares custody of his sons, and says he can’t think of a decision he has made in the last dozen or so years without thinking about how it would impact them.Now his life centers on the boys, his home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, yoga (“I said I love it, I didn’t say I’m doing it”), and saunas (“very purifying”).“He was a wild guy, and now I think he’s channeled all of that into his family, and his work,” said the director Dan Gilroy, who said he cast Mr. Farrell in “Roman Israel” in part because he knew he could hold his own with Denzel Washington.Mr. Farrell said he planned to take a long break, and he was open to what’s next, be it action heroes, even though he loathes guns (“Hate ’em!”) or, in the vein of Mr. Lanthimos’s films, more unsexy roles, even if he might be somewhat alone in characterizing them that way.“I still think he was sexy” in those movies, Mr. McDonagh wrote in his email. “He couldn’t really get rid of that without chopping his head off.”', 'Balfour Declaration of Support for Jewish Homeland Still Divisive at 100 - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — It was the moment of conception of what would become the State of Israel — or it was the original sin in which Israel was conceived.The Balfour Declaration, the pivotal, 67-word assurance by the British foreign secretary that promised support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people,” turned 100 on Thursday, meeting with tributes in Jerusalem and London, and tear gas in Bethlehem.Demonstrators marched in nearly every major West Bank city. In Ramallah, thousands of flag-waving Palestinian Authority employees, Fatah youth guard members and schoolchildren, streamed to the mausoleum of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and then to Al-Manarah Square, chanting “Balfour falls” and “We will not give up our right to exist.”In Bethlehem, where protesters on Wednesday burned an effigy of Arthur James Balfour, the declaration’s author, and then beat it with their shoes, demonstrators on Thursday were met for the second straight day with tear gas canisters and rubber bullets fired by Israeli soldiers.Dueling academic conferences at the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities in central Jerusalem and at the Palestinian National Theater in East Jerusalem offered sharply different takes on the document’s meaning, genesis and historical consequences. The former emphasized World War I-era geopolitics and international law, and the latter keyed on imperialism and racism.As much as the Balfour Declaration became a cornerstone of the creation of Israel three decades later, it also earned the undying enmity of Palestine’s Arab population — which it referred to obliquely as “the existing non-Jewish communities of Palestine.”At the British Consulate in East Jerusalem, a group of teenage Palestinian schoolgirls delivered hundreds of letters to Prime Minister Theresa May as part of a campaign, led by the Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, to get Britain to “make it right” and recognize a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 borders.Mr. Abbas has been demanding lately that Britain apologize for the Balfour Declaration. No apology is expected, though the artist-satirist Banksy arranged for a look-alike of Queen Elizabeth II to offer one, along with cake, on Wednesday in Bethlehem.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was to ring in the occasion at a dinner on Thursday in London with Mrs. May, arranged by Baron Jacob Rothschild, whose great-uncle was the recipient of Balfour’s famous letter.For a 100-year-old artifact, the declaration remains very much a live issue between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as between the Israeli left and right. Politicians, pundits and academics are wielding it to score points both historical and contemporary.A right-wing commentator, Shimon Riklin, wrote on Twitter this week that if the Palestinian national movement truly wanted a state along the 1967 borders, “it would not be challenging the Balfour Declaration.”“They want it all,” he said. “Get used to it.”Yousef Jabareen, an Arab member of Knesset, noted that the Balfour Declaration’s reference to “civil and religious rights” of Arabs had stopped short of granting them national or political rights.“One hundred years later, I see a similar attitude,” he said in an interview. “The dominant political discourse in this government guarantees self-determination only for Jews, and what is left for Palestinians is some kind of civil and religious rights.”Another Arab member of Knesset, Zouheir Bahlool, said he would boycott the parliamentary ceremony marking the declaration’s anniversary, and threatened to leave his left-of-center party, the Zionist Union.In an interview late Wednesday, Mr. Bahlool spoke of the Balfour Declaration as if it were a fresh wound. “This declaration virtually buried the existence of the Palestinian people, which I am a part of,” he said. The document, he said, promoted self-determination for the Jewish people “while completely ignoring the fact that there were Palestinians here.”But then, a century is not so very long in the Holy Land.The fundamental problems the Balfour Declaration raised — as “one nation solemnly promised to a second nation the country of a third,” in the author Arthur Koestler’s memorable formulation — have not been resolved in the intervening years but rather compounded and complicated.It is going too far to say the Balfour Declaration alone paved the way for the creation of Israel, but it is not an exaggeration to say that without it Israel probably could not have come to be, said Martin Kramer, a history professor at Shalem College in Jerusalem and author of an exhaustive retelling of the document’s genesis and aftermath in Mosaic magazine.“What Palestinians do when they focus on the Balfour Declaration as the root cause is to absolve themselves of all they did after,” he said. “They could have tried to reach an agreement with the Zionists. But they wanted zero immigration of Jews. That put them in an untenable situation.”Dated Nov. 2, 1917, the letter was delivered to the leaders of Britain’s Jewish community at the height of World War I, when Britain was driving the Ottomans from Palestine and seeking Jewish support in the United States to spur the American war effort. It did not gain the force of international law until 1920, when the remains of the Ottoman Empire were divided into mandates by the League of Nations, and the British inserted the Balfour Declaration into the text for their mandate for Palestine.The Arabs of Palestine were overmatched in the diplomatic realm, offering only feeble attempts at rolling back the declaration, said Mahmoud Yazbak, a history professor at the University of Haifa. “They thought that by sending a letter to the prime minister or the queen, it would be enough,” he said, but they failed to grasp that Britain’s allies had also endorsed its position on supporting the Zionists.Even as the document’s centennial has triggered a new cacophony of political debate, it has also generated fresh scholarship that is sure to inspire even more debate.One of the more intriguing findings to emerge recently focuses on Sephardic Jews native to Palestine, some of whom found the declaration a needless provocation. The historians Hillel Cohen and Yuval Evri say many Sephardic Jews enjoyed close ties to the Arabs and correctly feared how they would respond to the Zionist project.One Sephardic Jewish leader, Hayyim Ben-Kiki, railed against the Zionist movement, with its European foundations, as an unwelcome imposition on an Eastern culture by Westerners who had “treated Arabs prejudicially and dismissed them.” Another, Yosef Castel, argued to Chaim Weizmann, the Zionist leader, that a young Arab movement was on the rise, that it would “never give up their demands for the Balfour Declaration to be annulled,” and that the document should be rewritten to assure the Arabs that Palestine should be developed as their own national home, too, alongside the Jews.“They believed they understood the Middle East much better than the Jews who came from Russia or Poland,” Mr. Cohen said in an interview, “so why separate ourselves to establish a Jewish, Western state?”That early plea from Jews in Palestine for a binational state, however, elicited not so much as a response from Weizmann, Mr. Cohen said. Still, he said, its existence raises a haunting question: “How might Jewish-Arab relations have developed differently?”', 'Pumping New Life into Israel’s Labor Party, From the Right - The New York TimesHAIFA, Israel — He was a nobody from Israel’s center-right just a few months ago, a onetime minor minister under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who was best known, if at all, for having quit the government in a huff.Then Avi Gabbay shocked the country’s political class in July by winning the leadership of Labor Party, the once mighty, but long moribund, champion of the Israeli left.Now, suddenly, Mr. Gabbay is everywhere: kibitzing on talk shows, fulminating on Facebook, drawing crowds on college campuses and even in right-wing backwaters where Labor politicians have long feared to tread. Even more improbably, he is forcing rivals to address whether they would serve alongside him if he were elected prime minister.If he accomplishes nothing else, Mr. Gabbay, 50, has quickly pulled off what seemed to be next to impossible: Giving hopeless, powerless and feckless Israeli liberals permission to at least imagine a post-Netanyahu restoration, to daydream again about being given a fresh chance to lead.A poll by an Israeli TV station, immediately after the Labor leadership contest in July, found that if elections were held then, Likud would take 29 seats in the Knesset and the Zionist Union, which includes Labor, would take 24 seats — eight more than the centrist Yesh Atid party led by Yair Lapid.But he has done it, in large part, by irritating those same liberals. Whether by design or by accident, Mr. Gabbay keeps popping off in ways that appeal to the right, not to the left. He spurned the idea of a coalition with Arab parties in the Knesset, saying they represented the constituents of the Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas, not Israeli Arabs. Mr. Gabbay welcomed a beefing up of religious content in public schools. He pooh-poohed the evacuation of West Bank settlements for the sake of peace with the Palestinians.And he dusted off an old Netanyahu insult about how “the left has forgotten what it means to be Jewish.”Mr. Gabbay now insists he was merely making a point about how to woo the more traditional Israelis who want to feel that they share the same values, not just policy views, with their leaders. “I respect everybody, whether they believe or don’t believe,” he said while campaigning last month in Haifa. “But I believe that we have to talk about our Jewish identity. That’s the main thing that unites us all.”The remark was a dog whistle for the right-of-center voters that Mr. Gabbay hopes to peel away from Mr. Netanyahu, said Yehuda Ben-Meir, a veteran of right-wing governments who now tracks public opinion for the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.“The left went crazy,” Mr. Ben-Meir said, “but the right paid attention.”Mr. Gabbay seems pleased by the attention he is getting, critical or not, though he welcomes it nonchalantly, as if it were a matter of simple math.Indeed, there is a directness to him, from the coolheaded way he fields questions from voters — listening to them all, to gauge the room, before patiently answering each — to how he decided to run in the first place.His unlikely path began in the executive suite at Bezeq, Israel’s state-owned telecommunications company, where his father had been a technician. Named its chief executive in 2007, Mr. Gabbay led the company through six years of deregulation, privatization and profit, firing a whole layer of managers so gently, according to one account, that they left his office smiling.After trying to buy El Al, the national airline, Mr. Gabbay, by now a multimillionaire, helped found the center-right Kulanu party in 2015 and then, when it joined Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition, became environmental minister.He had some successes, but he got no help from Mr. Netanyahu in cutting regulation, he complained, and was the lone vote in the cabinet against a big natural gas deal, which he said would cost consumers far too much.All the while, he said, he watched Mr. Netanyahu sowing division and hatred at his Sunday cabinet meetings. “Every week it’s like something against somebody,” Mr. Gabbay said in an interview. “It’s against the left, it’s against the media, against Arabs, and against, against, against.”His final straw was Mr. Netanyahu’s appointment of Avigdor Lieberman, a hard-line nationalist with few relevant qualifications, as defense minister.“You have to know something about” defense, Mr. Gabbay said, adding: “It’s not like being a minister of environmental protection.”So in May 2016, Mr. Gabbay quit.After retreating to Mykonos in Greece, toting biographies of the former prime ministers David Ben-Gurion and Menachem Begin, Mr. Gabbay said he decided to run for prime minister himself to change the political culture in Israel, something that he says can only be achieved from the very top.He chose Labor as his vehicle like a motorhead snapping up a wreck to restore: Its poll ratings were at record lows, and it was projected to win only eight of 120 Knesset seats. “People told me, ‘You are crazy,’” he said. “‘You are going to join this corpse? Seriously?’”They may not have appreciated his endurance. A veteran of eight marathons, with a tattoo of a runner under his suit, he barely caught his breath after the primary before beginning his campaign for prime minister, even though an election could be a year or two away.To Mr. Gabbay, the biggest problem with Mr. Netanyahu, and what will make it difficult to topple him, is his exploitation of identity politics, all too easy in Israel’s fractured society. “The mission of a prime minister is to be a prime minister of all the people in the country — not your camp, your side,” he said.That said, Mr. Gabbay, a son of Moroccan immigrants who spent his early years in a transit camp, can hope for support from other Mizrahi Jews, whose resentments have been a powerful force in the past. “I am coming from the people, I am not from the elite,” he said. His wife is a teacher; a brother drives a taxi. He would doubtless be the first prime minister who once waited tables in the Knesset cafeteria.A self-declared social democrat, he assails dog-eat-dog capitalism and pledges to repair the safety net and solve the country’s critical shortage of affordable housing. “We have to change Israel from a country where people just survive,” he said, “to one where people actually live.”He promises to tackle corruption, and wants to give preferential treatment to military veterans, and not press ultrareligious men into service. “I am coming from a position of ‘in favor of,’ not ‘against,’” he said, comparing himself with rivals who “are against the Arabs and Haredim. I am in favor of my kids.”The distinction, he added, was not lost on the Orthodox: “They like it very much.”While he supports a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Gabbay refuses to say what he’d give up for peace, only discussing what he wants to get — a demurral that is likely to be tested in the coming week in meetings in the United States, including a high-profile turn at the Saban Forum in Washington.Many Israelis find it hard to distinguish between Mr. Gabbay’s positions and those of Mr. Lapid, a former television host and minister who is again second to Mr. Netanyahu in more recent polls. Dahlia Scheindlin, a pollster for Labor in 2015, said politicians with greater skills than Mr. Gabbay had tried that before, but found too few center-right voters to chase. Labor, so identified with the left, she said, “practically doesn’t exist in their eyes.”But between them, Mr. Gabbay and Mr. Lapid could possibly steal enough support from the right to deny it an automatic majority. And Mr. Gabbay, while insisting he would win, also concedes he would be willing to serve under Mr. Lapid.For younger Laborites, who barely remember the party’s most recent victory, in 1999, the excitement surrounding Labor is intoxicating.“He’s not like the old left wing,” said Oren Idel, 23, a student at the Technion university in Haifa. “He’s a new Labor. I think he will bring a lot of voters back to us. He gives me a strong feeling that he’s someone we can trust.”', 'Jared Kushner on Stage: Hearing His Voice, at Last, if Little Else - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — The man who would bring peace to the Middle East strode onto the stage and peered out at a room full of people who have tried and failed.Tall and thin, confident and calm, Jared Kushner, rookie negotiator, made his debut in front of the world of veteran diplomatic hagglers on Sunday with a polite, deferential and purposefully bland appearance at a Middle East conference that was designed to pay respect but little more.For half an hour, Mr. Kushner answered questions on stage at the Saban Forum, the premier gathering of American and Middle Eastern luminaries each winter, but gave away no hint of the “ultimate deal” he and his father-in-law, President Trump, are developing for the long-benighted region. Many of those still nursing scars from their own tortured peace efforts came, if for no other reason, just to hear his voice, since he has been so removed from the public.“You see a lot of reasons why this deal could go south very quickly, and there’s a ton of distractions that come up,” Mr. Kushner acknowledged to those who knew that better than anyone. And yet, he said, “I am optimistic that there is a lot of hope for bringing a conclusion.”Mr. Kushner, who for good or ill looks younger than his 36 years, made a point of praising past negotiators, saying he was building on their efforts, without offering a particularly compelling argument for why the outcome now would be any different. In effect, he said, Mr. Trump had defied the odds by winning last year’s election, so no one should assume he cannot defy these odds as well.“The president has a very long career of accomplishing things that a lot of people say were impossible,” he said. “We do think it’s achievable.”But Mr. Kushner’s predecessors and other veterans of the region were not exactly bowled over. Some privately expressed anger, saying that he had insulted them with a substance-free performance, while others offered indulgent assessments noting that at least he had committed no gaffes.Mr. Kushner’s appearance at the Saban Forum, hosted by the Brookings Institution, came just days before the president is poised to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, a move that could disrupt the very peace initiative the White House is drafting between Israel and the Palestinians.By law, the president has until Monday to decide whether to sign an order keeping the United States Embassy in Tel Aviv or move it to Jerusalem, as he has repeatedly promised to do. Like other presidents before him, Mr. Trump has held off on relocating the embassy because both sides claim Jerusalem as their capital and such a move would be seen as prejudging a final peace agreement.Advisers have said Mr. Trump is poised to sign another waiver delaying the move for six more months but would balance that in a speech on Wednesday by recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. The consensus among the professionals in the room on Sunday, even those who agree on the substance, was that would be a beginner’s mistake.Robert Wexler, the president of the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace and a former Democratic congressman from Florida, said Mr. Kushner and his team had earned respect for their serious efforts and for making peace a priority. “They deserve credit for that,” he said, “which makes it more bewildering why they would seemingly put all that in jeopardy by a premature announcement.”Mr. Kushner was questioned on stage by Haim Saban, the Israeli-American entertainment mogul and prominent Democratic campaign contributor who sponsors the event. But in the course of 30 minutes, the president’s son-in-law determinedly stayed away from anything concrete.“It’s the art of saying nothing,” said former Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, who came close but failed to reach a deal with Yasir Arafat at Camp David in 2000 under the auspices of President Bill Clinton. But Mr. Barak said it would be inopportune for Mr. Kushner to get into details yet. “I don’t blame him.”Shalom Lipner, a former adviser to seven Israeli prime ministers, including the current one, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Mr. Kushner had provided little to judge. “He came across as confident,” Mr. Lipner said. “He showed a grasp, an engagement on the issues. But the test itself will be what an actual plan looks like. That will be more telling.”Mr. Kushner’s talk came just two days after Michael T. Flynn, the president’s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador during the postelection transition. Court papers indicated that he was directed to talk with the ambassador by a senior transition official who has been identified as Mr. Kushner.Mr. Kushner was not quizzed about either development, but at one point when asked about the challenges of life at the top of the political stage, he professed not to be bothered by the slings and arrows that come with it. “We try not to be distracted by the day to day,” he said, referring to himself and his wife, Ivanka Trump. “We don’t pay a lot of attention.”Mr. Saban noted at the start of their talk that the court documents filed on Friday cited Mr. Kushner’s role during the presidential transition in lobbying against a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, contradicting the position of President Barack Obama while he was still in office.The intervention was highly controversial, given that Mr. Trump had not yet been inaugurated and was effectively working against the foreign policy of the incumbent president. Some have even suggested that it could violate the Logan Act, an 18th-century law that bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States and foreign governments.But the law has never been successfully prosecuted in modern times, and the special counsel in the Russia investigation seems more interested in whether anyone lied to investigators about the episode.Either way, Mr. Saban cheered Mr. Kushner on for defending Israel. “As far as I know, nothing illegal there, but I think that this crowd and myself want to thank you for making that effort,” Mr. Saban said. “So thank you very much.”Not everyone in the crowd actually agreed. But as he learns to keep his cards close to the vest, Mr. Kushner the negotiator nodded his thanks and had nothing more to say on the matter.', 'What Michael Flynn’s Guilty Plea Means in Mueller’s Russia Inquiry - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, was charged and pleaded guilty on Friday to making false statements. Mr. Flynn said he had agreed to cooperate with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, in his broader investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.Here are excerpts from court documents and what they mean:Mr. Mueller is charging Mr. Flynn with a single count of lying to the F.B.I. during a Jan. 24 interview, under a plea agreement in which he could serve up to six months in prison and pay a fine of $500 to $9,500. What is most notable here is all the other offenses from which Mr. Flynn escaped charges. Those other potential charges were the leverage that Mr. Mueller successfully used to pressure Mr. Flynn to flip and cooperate in exchange for leniency.It had been clear for months that Mr. Flynn faced serious legal jeopardy on a range of issues, including work that his lobbying firm performed for Turkey without registering as agents of a foreign power. Earlier this year, Mr. Flynn belatedly filed a Foreign Agents Registration Act disclosure with the Justice Department. But even though Mr. Mueller has obtained an indictment against Paul Manafort Jr., Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, in part for violating that same law, he did not charge Mr. Flynn under it.Moreover, a court filing mentions that Mr. Flynn made several false statements in his belated foreign-agent registration, such as “omitting that officials from the Republic of Turkey provided supervision and direction over the Turkey project.” But Mr. Flynn faced no separate charges based on those lies. Each potential false statement charge could have carried up to five years in prison.Notably, the filings do not mention other conduct by Mr. Flynn that has also attracted legal scrutiny. For example, he is also said to have left contacts with Russian officials off his application for a security clearance and again failed to disclose them in response to questions by officials processing that application, which could have resulted in separate false statement charges. Since the plea agreement only immunizes the conduct it mentions from further prosecution, it is not clear why such other issues were omitted.Mr. Flynn has now admitted that he lied when he told the F.B.I. that he had not discussed sanctions with Sergey I. Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, during the transition period. In fact, as Mr. Flynn has now acknowledged, after outgoing President Barack Obama signed an executive order on Dec. 28 imposing the sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its election interference, Mr. Flynn — at the request of an unnamed transition official — asked Mr. Kislyak for Russia to consider reacting with restraint.Their conversations about sanctions have been well documented, and helped catalyze the chain of events that led to Mr. Mueller’s appointment. On Dec. 30, for example, after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia announced that his country would not retaliate at that time for the sanctions, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter: “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) — I always knew he was very smart!” On Jan. 15, Vice President-elect Mike Pence publicly denied that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak.But soon after the F.B.I. interview in which Mr. Flynn falsely said the same thing, Sally Q. Yates, an Obama-era holdover serving as acting attorney general, warned the Trump White House that Russia could blackmail Mr. Flynn over having lied. Mr. Trump soon fired Ms. Yates over an unrelated matter, but did not act against Mr. Flynn until The Washington Post reported nearly two weeks later that intelligence officials knew that Mr. Flynn and the Russian ambassador had talked about sanctions, leaving Mr. Kislyak with the impression that the Trump administration would revisit the issue after taking office. Mr. Trump then fired Mr. Flynn, ostensibly for having misled Mr. Pence.Mr. Trump later pressured James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to go easy on Mr. Flynn, according to Mr. Comey, before eventually firing him over his handling of the Russia investigation — a step that led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller as special counsel.Mr. Flynn has also admitted lying to the F.B.I. about asking Russia and several other countries for help in thwarting an Obama administration foreign policy decision to permit the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution condemning Israel for building settlements in Palestinian territory. Russia nevertheless declined to delay or veto the measure, which the Security Council passed despite lobbying by Israel and the objections from the Trump transition team.Some commentators have raised the question of whether such efforts by Mr. Flynn and the Trump transition team to lobby foreign governments in ways that conflicted with the official policy of the United States under the Obama administration before they took power were a violation of the Logan Act. That is a 1799 law that bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States and foreign governments. But this statute has raised constitutional concerns and is generally considered a dead letter, meaning it remains on the books but is defunct.In trying to figure out what happened with Russia and the Trump campaign, Mr. Mueller appears to be following a strategy of starting at the fringes and moving inward, pressuring people to cooperate. Mr. Flynn may, of course, have already given information to Mr. Mueller’s team that is not mentioned in these court filings. But one question raised by the documents is who the unnamed people are with whom he spoke about these matters — and what those people told federal investigators.For example, Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and close adviser, reportedly took the lead for the transition team on the United Nations Security Council resolution about Israel. Earlier this month, Mr. Mueller’s investigators interviewed Mr. Kushner about Mr. Flynn’s interactions with the Russian ambassador.', 'Congressional Democrats Left Out of White House Hanukkah Party - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — The latkes were fried and the kosher lamb chops were prepared on Thursday, just as in past years, for the first White House Hanukkah party of the Trump era. But there was one prominent break with tradition: President Trump did not invite Democratic lawmakers.Mr. Trump, who prizes loyalty and seldom forgets a slight, left Democratic members of Congress off his Hanukkah list this year, according to congressional aides tracking the invites. He also did not invite Reform Jewish leaders who have been critical of him or progressive Jewish activists who have differed with him publicly on policy issues.The move injected a partisan tinge into a normally bipartisan celebration at the White House, where on Thursday Mr. Trump spoke to a crowd standing amid Christmas trees.“I know for a fact there are a lot of happy people in this room,” Mr. Trump said to raucous whoops and applause, adding simply, “Jerusalem.”He wished those assembled a Happy Hanukkah, then said, “I think this one will go down as especially special.”Mr. Trump’s young grandchildren, who are Jewish, lit a menorah to mark the occasion.This year’s Hanukkah party was all the more joyous for attendees because it came the day after Mr. Trump delighted many Jews, particularly those politically allied with him, by declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel and recommitting himself to moving the American Embassy there.“People are in a celebratory mood and just kvelling over this incredible, historic moment,” said Morton Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America, who attended the reception as well as a “Hanukkah Nightcap” party afterward at the Trump International Hotel. That affair was hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition, the organization funded by the casino magnate and Republican superdonor Sheldon Adelson, and America First Action, a political action committee staffed by Trump allies.Representatives Lee Zeldin of New York and David Kustoff of Tennessee, the two Jewish Republicans in Congress, were attending the party, their offices said. But Jewish Democrats left off the invite list — many of whom have been harsh critics of Mr. Trump — were not in a festive mood.“It’s deeply unfortunate that the White House Hanukkah Party — a bipartisan event bringing together Jewish and non-Jewish leaders alike to celebrate the Festival of Lights since 2001 — has turned into a partisan affair under this administration,” Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York said in a statement.This year, officials slashed the size of the annual reception, inviting around 300 guests to one soiree instead of hosting 1,700 over two parties as in the past.Among those who did not make the cut were Rabbi Rick Jacobs, the president of the Union for Reform Judaism, who in August criticized Mr. Trump for his handling of the neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Va. On Wednesday, Rabbi Jacobs said the president should not have made his declaration about Jerusalem, arguing that it could undermine the chances of achieving peace between Israelis and Palestinians.The White House chalked up the limited guest list to a new approach from the president.“I am not aware of the political affiliation of any of the guests, but I do know that this year was meant to be more personal than political,” said Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, the first lady, whose office oversees White House party planning. She declined to elaborate.But for some invitees, the message was clear.“He did not invite people who have been hostile to him,” Mr. Klein said in an interview. He should know. After being invited to the 2009 White House Hanukkah party during President Barack Obama’s first year in office, Mr. Klein was later cut from the guest list after condemning the former president in scathing terms. (Last year, Mr. Klein referred to Mr. Obama as a “Jew-hating anti-Semite.”)Officials from J Street, a progressive pro-Israel group that strongly backed Mr. Obama and the nuclear deal he forged with Iran — which was detested by many conservative Jews — were excluded.Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said Mr. Trump’s proclamation on Jerusalem was a “consensus issue in the Jewish community.” He said it would add to an ebullient mood at the Hanukkah party, which is to mark an eight-night festival beginning Tuesday night that celebrates the Jews liberating their temple from oppressors.Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, mingled at length with guests, attendees said, and both he and Mr. Trump were showered with compliments about the Jerusalem speech.“It was very festive and appropriate,” said Nathan J. Diament, the policy director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, who brought his 12-year-old son, Josh. “People were telling them, ‘Thank you,’ and, ‘Congratulations.’The attendance of a Supreme Court justice, Stephen G. Breyer, nominated in 1994 by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, was the only hint of bipartisanship at the gathering, Mr. Diament said.At the party at the Trump International Hotel, in a small room adjoining the presidential ballroom, guests gathered to eat fish roe, latkes, egg salad and salmon. Attendees mingled with an assorted band of Republican representatives, including Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, Lee Zeldin of New York and Don Bacon of Nebraska.Other boldfaced names in the Trump orbit, including David A. Clarke Jr., a former sheriff of Milwaukee County, and Jill Kelley, the Tampa socialite, mingled near the bar. Several guests clutched copies of the book “Let Trump Be Trump,” by Corey Lewandowski, the president’s first campaign manager, which he had been signing earlier in the lobby.Duvi Honig, the founder of the Orthodox Jewish Chamber of Commerce, a group that works to encourage business opportunities and shape public policy, was also in attendance. Of the earlier reception, he said he believed the White House had focused on inviting allies and “new kids on the block” versus people who had been invited every year in the past.“The president’s making a nice statement recognizing how he’s judging success,” said Mr. Honig, who recently returned from a trip to Israel with the former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci. “He’s an investor. He sees where the return is.”Mr. Honig, who took photographs with Mr. Pence and Mr. Adelson, said he was impressed with Mr. Trump’s “calm, confident” demeanor at the White House.“He wasn’t bragging about Jerusalem,” Mr. Honig said. “He said it was the right thing to do. He showed America that we can lead and make a controversial decision.”', 'Michael Flynn’s Guilty Plea: 10 Key Takeaways - The New York TimesThis essay has been updated to reflect news developments.Michael Flynn’s plea on Friday to a single count of lying to the F.B.I. is a seismic event in the special counsel investigation.For starters, it portends the likelihood of impeachable charges being brought against the president of the United States. Mr. Flynn, a former national security adviser, acknowledged that he was cooperating with the investigation. His testimony could bring into the light a scandal of historic proportions in which the not-yet-installed Trump administration, including Donald Trump personally, sought to subvert American foreign policy before taking office.The repercussions of the plea will be months in the making, but it’s not an exaggeration to say that the events to which Mr. Flynn has agreed to testify will take their place in the history books alongside the Watergate and Iran-contra scandals.We’re in new — and highly inflammatory — territory. Here are 10 immediate takeaways from today’s news.Both sides did not assess their risks and decide to hedge them with a compromise. Rather, as we’ve known for weeks, the special counsel, Robert Mueller, believed he had sufficient evidence to indict Mr. Flynn on a long list of criminal charges, including money laundering, tax offense and false statements. Mr. Mueller’s team, as is standard prosecutorial practice, presented Mr. Flynn with that list and helped him understand that his life as he knew it had ended.Mr. Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, has been indicted, but this is a plea, and Mr. Flynn’s cooperation — the real goal of bringing criminal charges — has been secured. This puts Mr. Flynn in the same camp as George Papadopoulos, the campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to making false statements to the F.B.I. on Oct. 5 and is also cooperating with the investigation. Unlike Mr. Papadopoulos, though, Mr. Flynn was a top adviser who was at the center of communication with Russia as well as the potential obstruction of justice by President Trump in seeking to shut down the Flynn investigation itself. Mr. Flynn was considered as a running mate and reportedly stayed quite close to the president even after being forced out of the administration in February.Mr. Flynn’s plea on Friday concerned just one crime. The other charges that prosecutors threatened him with continue to hang over him. Mr. Flynn will not receive credit for his cooperation until after it has ended, at which point Mr. Mueller may — if Mr. Flynn has held up his end of the bargain — move to dismiss the other charges. In the interim, Mr. Flynn has to do anything Mr. Mueller’s team requests.He is admitting that last December, before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, he asked the Russian ambassador at the time, Sergey Kislyak, to refrain from reacting aggressively to sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia. Russia reportedly agreed and Mr. Kislyak told Mr. Flynn later that it had chosen to moderate its response to the sanctions to make nice with the Trump team.If Mr. Flynn testifies to this — ABC’s Brian Ross is reporting that he will — it presents another impeachable offense along with the possible obstruction of justice. Even more, it brings the whole matter well outside the purview of the criminal courts into the province of a political scandal, indicating abuses of power arguably well beyond those in the Watergate and Iran-contra affairs.He is admitting that last Dec. 22, he asked Mr. Kislyak to delay or defeat a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israel for its settlement policy, which the Obama administration had decided to let pass. The possible involvement or knowledge of Israel in the case will be one of many questions that congressional investigators will pursue.In the end, Mr. Flynn’s lies are secondary to the demonstration that the Trump administration was actively undermining American foreign policy before it took office. This will most likely prove the most abiding scandalous fact of the Mueller investigation. And it’s one that nobody on either side of the aisle could possibly defend.Most immediately vulnerable? Jared Kushner. Mr. Flynn was present at a Dec. 1, 2016, Trump Tower meeting where Mr. Kushner is said to have proposed to Mr. Kislyak setting up a back channel for the transition team to communicate with Moscow.Those and related details are now front and center in the investigation. Criminal liability aside, Friday’s news — including a report that Mr. Kushner was the one who directed Mr. Flynn to contact Russia — helps cement Mr. Kushner’s reputation as a callow and arrogant freelancer, authorized by the president to act way over his head, and possibly impairing some of the most delicate and important issues of foreign policy. (A possible winner, on the other hand, is the younger Mike Flynn, about whose criminal liability his father was extremely concerned. Look to see how Mr. Mueller now chooses to treat the younger Mr. Flynn, who is being investigated over his work for his father’s lobbying business.)The basis for the possible obstruction charge against the president has been his efforts to get the F.B.I. director, James Comey, to shut down the Flynn investigation during a Feb. 14 meeting in the Oval Office, coupled with his multiple lies on the subject. Obstruction is plainly an impeachable offense: It’s the offense for which Richard Nixon was threatened with impeachment.For months, it has seemed the possible culminating charge of the Mueller investigation, a straightforward and readily understandable high crime or misdemeanor. Such a charge, per Department of Justice policy, would not be brought in the criminal courts but would rather form the basis of a report to Congress potentially recommending impeachment. If Mr. Mueller brings that charge, it will be on the strength of Mr. Flynn’s testimony.There had been a prospect that the obstruction of justice charge, if it did come, would be dismissed by die-hard Trump supporters as subject to conflicting interpretations of Mr. Trump’s state of mind, and therefore not deserving of impeachment or removal. No longer. Now Mr. Trump and his circle will stand accused by a former member of the administration with plainly unconstitutional meddling in the most sensitive of foreign policy issues. If the Congress and country believe Michael Flynn’s account, it is hard to see what even the staunchest Trump defenders can say in defense. That means that as Mr. Trump and the administration look out at the new landscape featuring a guilty Michael Flynn, it’s kill or be killed.', 'Did Trump Kill Off a Two-State Solution? He Says No, Palestinians Say Yes - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump, in formally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Wednesday, declared that the United States still supported a two-state solution to settle the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, provided it was “agreed to by both sides.”For the first time in his 26 years as a peacemaker, the chief negotiator for the Palestinians did not agree.Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization and a steadfast advocate for a Palestinian state, said in an interview on Thursday that Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel “have managed to destroy that hope.” He embraced a radical shift in the P.L.O.’s goals — to a single state, but with Palestinians enjoying the same civil rights as Israelis, including the vote.“They’ve left us with no option,” he said. “This is the reality. We live here. Our struggle should focus on one thing: equal rights.”Mr. Erekat’s change of heart is unlikely to change Palestinian policy. The dream of a Palestinian state is too deeply ingrained in a generation of its leaders for the Palestinian Authority to abandon it now. Israel would be unlikely to accede to equal rights, because granting a vote to millions of Palestinians would eventually lead to the end of Israel as a Jewish state.But the fact that Mr. Erekat is speaking openly about it attests to the turmoil caused in the Middle East by Mr. Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem. More so than the protests that erupted in the West Bank, which injured dozens of people but were less intense than expected, the comments of senior Palestinians like Mr. Erekat captured the profound sense of despair.Administration officials strenuously reject the argument that Mr. Trump has foreclosed a two-state solution. He recommitted himself to brokering what he has called the “ultimate deal” between the two sides, they said. He studiously avoided taking a position on the eventual borders or sovereignty of Jerusalem. And he called for status quo in the administration of the Jewish and Muslim holy sites in the Old City of Jerusalem.“We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians,” Mr. Trump said.Beyond the president’s words, there were other signs he is serious about his intentions. On the same day that he signed his name with a John Hancock-like flourish to a proclamation recognizing Jerusalem as the capital, he quietly signed another document that will delay the move of the American Embassy to the city for at least six months — and probably much longer.White House officials insist that Mr. Trump’s decision was driven by practical and logistical, not political, considerations. The State Department, they said, cannot open a functioning embassy in Jerusalem on the timetable stipulated under a 1995 law that requires the president to sign a national-security waiver every six months to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv.But putting off the move avoids a tangible symbol of America’s new policy and spares the White House a series of decisions — like where in the city to place the embassy — that would begin to define the geography of Mr. Trump’s deliberately general statement about Jerusalem.“Avoiding a move of the embassy is a way of avoiding geographic definition,” said Martin S. Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel. “Avoiding any geographic definition of their recognition of Jerusalem looks like their effort to keep the peace process alive.”Legal experts said there was nothing in the 1995 law that would prevent the Trump administration from simply hanging a sign outside the existing American consulate in Jerusalem and calling it the embassy. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States hastily set up embassies in temporary quarters in the capitals of newly independent republics.“I would be surprised if the State Department interpreted the Jerusalem Embassy Act as requiring it to break ground on a new embassy facility or take other such steps,” said Scott R. Anderson, a David M. Rubenstein fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.“The plain language of the statute only requires that the secretary of state determine and report to Congress that the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem has officially opened,” he said.Other former Middle East diplomats said the decision to delay the embassy move was far less important than the symbolic weight of Mr. Trump’s statement on Jerusalem.“This was trying to be too clever by half,” said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a Princeton professor and former American ambassador to Israel and Egypt. “If they think that anybody is going to be fooled into thinking this makes their diplomacy credible, they’re kidding themselves.”Likewise, some longtime Middle East observers said Mr. Erekat’s talk of a one-state solution reflected anger rather than a watershed change in the Palestinian position. Given Israel’s probable rejection of equal rights, American and Israeli supporters of a two-state solution said that option, for all intents and purposes, remained the only game in town.“I don’t want to minimize the hurt the Palestinians feel,” said David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “But there was a duality to Trump’s message that has gotten lost.”Mr. Trump, he said, was not closing the door to negotiations on borders and sovereignty. “Both parts should be heard,” he said. While he questioned the timing of the move, he said the Palestinians could return to the table when tempers cool.“Right now their anger is such that they probably can’t hear this,” Mr. Makovsky said. “But if he presents a plan in the first quarter, are you not going to want to hear what it is? The Palestinians still think Trump’s enough of a bulldozer that if he gave something to the Israelis on a Wednesday, he’s capable of giving something to the Palestinians on a Thursday.”In his interview, Mr. Erekat lumped in Mr. Trump’s move on Jerusalem with the administration’s threat to close the P.L.O.’s mission in Washington and other threats to cut funding to the Palestinians.“These people,” he said of Mr. Trump and his Middle East team, “are more Israeli than Israel.”Mr. Erekat said he planned to push within the Palestinian National Council, the P.L.O.’s parliament, for a shift in strategy. The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, hinted at such a move in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September.But even if Mr. Erekat were able to persuade Mr. Abbas to give up the two-state dream, it would be a wrenching change for a generation of Palestinian leaders who made the difficult journey to coming to terms with their diminished territory after the Arab-Israeli War of 1967.“It’s hard to see how you can go down that route without at some stage divesting yourself of a semblance of a self-governing authority,” said Daniel Levy, the London-based president of the U.S./Middle East Project. “You’ve got to call time on the Palestinian Authority, which never became a state.”Instead, Mr. Levy said he believed that the peace process, and the Palestinians, were in a “transitional period,” in which the two-state solution had failed for now. But he added, “what people have done can be undone.”', 'Congressional Democrats Left Out of White House Hanukkah Party - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — The latkes were fried and the kosher lamb chops were prepared on Thursday, just as in past years, for the first White House Hanukkah party of the Trump era. But there was one prominent break with tradition: President Trump did not invite Democratic lawmakers.Mr. Trump, who prizes loyalty and seldom forgets a slight, left Democratic members of Congress off his Hanukkah list this year, according to congressional aides tracking the invites. He also did not invite Reform Jewish leaders who have been critical of him or progressive Jewish activists who have differed with him publicly on policy issues.The move injected a partisan tinge into a normally bipartisan celebration at the White House, where on Thursday Mr. Trump spoke to a crowd standing amid Christmas trees.“I know for a fact there are a lot of happy people in this room,” Mr. Trump said to raucous whoops and applause, adding simply, “Jerusalem.”He wished those assembled a Happy Hanukkah, then said, “I think this one will go down as especially special.”Mr. Trump’s young grandchildren, who are Jewish, lit a menorah to mark the occasion.This year’s Hanukkah party was all the more joyous for attendees because it came the day after Mr. Trump delighted many Jews, particularly those politically allied with him, by declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel and recommitting himself to moving the American Embassy there.“People are in a celebratory mood and just kvelling over this incredible, historic moment,” said Morton Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America, who attended the reception as well as a “Hanukkah Nightcap” party afterward at the Trump International Hotel. That affair was hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition, the organization funded by the casino magnate and Republican superdonor Sheldon Adelson, and America First Action, a political action committee staffed by Trump allies.Representatives Lee Zeldin of New York and David Kustoff of Tennessee, the two Jewish Republicans in Congress, were attending the party, their offices said. But Jewish Democrats left off the invite list — many of whom have been harsh critics of Mr. Trump — were not in a festive mood.“It’s deeply unfortunate that the White House Hanukkah Party — a bipartisan event bringing together Jewish and non-Jewish leaders alike to celebrate the Festival of Lights since 2001 — has turned into a partisan affair under this administration,” Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York said in a statement.This year, officials slashed the size of the annual reception, inviting around 300 guests to one soiree instead of hosting 1,700 over two parties as in the past.Among those who did not make the cut were Rabbi Rick Jacobs, the president of the Union for Reform Judaism, who in August criticized Mr. Trump for his handling of the neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Va. On Wednesday, Rabbi Jacobs said the president should not have made his declaration about Jerusalem, arguing that it could undermine the chances of achieving peace between Israelis and Palestinians.The White House chalked up the limited guest list to a new approach from the president.“I am not aware of the political affiliation of any of the guests, but I do know that this year was meant to be more personal than political,” said Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, the first lady, whose office oversees White House party planning. She declined to elaborate.But for some invitees, the message was clear.“He did not invite people who have been hostile to him,” Mr. Klein said in an interview. He should know. After being invited to the 2009 White House Hanukkah party during President Barack Obama’s first year in office, Mr. Klein was later cut from the guest list after condemning the former president in scathing terms. (Last year, Mr. Klein referred to Mr. Obama as a “Jew-hating anti-Semite.”)Officials from J Street, a progressive pro-Israel group that strongly backed Mr. Obama and the nuclear deal he forged with Iran — which was detested by many conservative Jews — were excluded.Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said Mr. Trump’s proclamation on Jerusalem was a “consensus issue in the Jewish community.” He said it would add to an ebullient mood at the Hanukkah party, which is to mark an eight-night festival beginning Tuesday night that celebrates the Jews liberating their temple from oppressors.Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, mingled at length with guests, attendees said, and both he and Mr. Trump were showered with compliments about the Jerusalem speech.“It was very festive and appropriate,” said Nathan J. Diament, the policy director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, who brought his 12-year-old son, Josh. “People were telling them, ‘Thank you,’ and, ‘Congratulations.’The attendance of a Supreme Court justice, Stephen G. Breyer, nominated in 1994 by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, was the only hint of bipartisanship at the gathering, Mr. Diament said.At the party at the Trump International Hotel, in a small room adjoining the presidential ballroom, guests gathered to eat fish roe, latkes, egg salad and salmon. Attendees mingled with an assorted band of Republican representatives, including Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, Lee Zeldin of New York and Don Bacon of Nebraska.Other boldfaced names in the Trump orbit, including David A. Clarke Jr., a former sheriff of Milwaukee County, and Jill Kelley, the Tampa socialite, mingled near the bar. Several guests clutched copies of the book “Let Trump Be Trump,” by Corey Lewandowski, the president’s first campaign manager, which he had been signing earlier in the lobby.Duvi Honig, the founder of the Orthodox Jewish Chamber of Commerce, a group that works to encourage business opportunities and shape public policy, was also in attendance. Of the earlier reception, he said he believed the White House had focused on inviting allies and “new kids on the block” versus people who had been invited every year in the past.“The president’s making a nice statement recognizing how he’s judging success,” said Mr. Honig, who recently returned from a trip to Israel with the former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci. “He’s an investor. He sees where the return is.”Mr. Honig, who took photographs with Mr. Pence and Mr. Adelson, said he was impressed with Mr. Trump’s “calm, confident” demeanor at the White House.“He wasn’t bragging about Jerusalem,” Mr. Honig said. “He said it was the right thing to do. He showed America that we can lead and make a controversial decision.”', '                                                                                                                 (Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Denies Yemen Rebels Fired Missile at Abu Dhabi Nuclear Plant - The New York TimesDEAD SEA, Jordan — Yemen’s Houthi rebels said on Sunday that they had fired a cruise missile at a $20 billion nuclear power plant under construction in Abu Dhabi, but the United Arab Emirates’ state-run news agency immediately denied the claim.A statement on the Houthi website said the missile took aim at the “strategic” Barakah nuclear reactor on Saturday, “successfully hitting its target.” The launch was in retaliation for the closing of sea and airports, it said, without offering evidence or providing further details.The statement quoted a Houthi leader who warned against continuing the blockade, “affirming Yemenis’ right to take sensitive steps.”On Twitter, the state agency WAM denied the Houthi rebels had launched a missile toward the United Arab Emirates. In another post on Twitter, WAM said, “U.A.E. possesses an air defense system capable of dealing with any threat of any kind and the project of Barakah reactor is immune.”It is the second time this year that the Iran-aligned Houthis have said they fired a missile toward the United Arab Emirates since the Gulf States, led by Saudi Arabia, began an air campaign against the rebels who had toppled the Gulf-allied president of Yemen, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, in 2015.A few months ago, the Houthis said they had “successfully” test-fired a missile toward Abu Dhabi.The Saudi coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, accuses Iran of trying to expand its influence into Arab countries, including Yemen, which shares a long border with Saudi Arabia, by aligning with the Houthis.The coalition has targeted the Houthi rebels with deadly airstrikes. The Houthis, in turn, have launched dozens of ballistic missiles toward Saudi territories, inflicting little damage but causing anxiety among Gulf monarchs, who have suspected cooperation between the rebels and Iran and Hezbollah.The rebels’ claim of an attack on a nuclear power plant also comes days after Israel said it had destroyed an Iranian base near the Syrian city of al-Qiswa, southwest of Damascus, on Friday.It is unclear if there were any casualties, since the base had not been completed. There has been no official Iranian reaction. Israel also has not commented on the reports. But it previously acknowledged carrying out repeated air and missile strikes in Syria since the beginning of the war six years ago, to stop arms deliveries to Hezbollah.On Sunday, an Iranian analyst, Hamidreza Taraghi, who has close ties to Iran’s leaders, denied the country had links to the missile attack claimed by the Yemen rebels.“We have nothing to do with this,” Mr. Taraghi said. “The Houthis are very capable of hitting targets without our assistance.”But Iran’s regional rival, Saudi Arabia, and its allies insist that Iran has provided the Houthis with such weaponry and say that the rebels are taking commands from Tehran.The Yemen rebels’ claim about striking a target in Abu Dhabi comes amid heavy fighting in Yemen’s capital, Sana, between the Shiite Houthi rebels and some of their former allies, who are led by former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.Mr. Saleh, who stepped down in 2011 after a mass uprising against his 33 years in office, has formed an alliance with the Houthis. Since then, fractures have emerged between the former leader and the rebels, exacerbating the crisis.In a televised speech on Saturday, Mr. Saleh blamed the Houthis’ “idiocy” for the war in Yemen and declared that he was ready to turn a “new page” in ties with the coalition if it stopped the attacks on his country.“I call upon the brothers in neighboring states and the alliance to stop their aggression, lift the siege, open the airports and allow food aid and the saving of the wounded, and we will turn a new page by virtue of our neighborliness,” Mr. Saleh said.In a statement carried by the Saudi-owned news outlet Al-Hadath, the coalition appeared to welcome Mr. Saleh’s remarks, saying it was “confident of the will of the leaders and sons” of Mr. Saleh’s political party to return to the fold.Such a move by Mr. Saleh could pave the way to end the war, which has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophes, unleashing signs of famine and outbreaks of cholera.The apparent shift came as Mr. Saleh’s supporters battled Houthi fighters for a fourth day in the capital. A senior security officer at the Ministry of Interior in Sana said that about 80 people have died and at least 140 more have been injured since fighting broke out.The nuclear power plant, in Abu Dhabi’s far western desert, is being built by the Korea Electric Power Corporation near the border with Saudi Arabia and is scheduled to begin operating next year, the United Arab Emirates energy minister has said, according to The Associated Press.', 'Secretary of state says President Trump\'s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel \'aligns U.S. presence with reality\'; Rich Edson reports from the State Department.BRUSSELS – It\'s a go-to catchphrase when U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is called on to explain his boss on the world stage: "America first is not America alone." Yet as President Donald Trump declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel, Tillerson on Wednesday stood all by himself.The onslaught came from all sides as Tillerson, at NATO headquarters in Brussels, got an earful from many a U.S. ally on Trump\'s Jerusalem move. So far, not a single country — other than Israel, of course — has thrown its support behind the declaration. Even Tillerson\'s own State Department has conceded the announcement could sow unrest throughout the Middle East.Turkey\'s top diplomat, Mevlut Cavusoglu, was unsparing in criticism that was far harsher than any the U.S. is accustomed to from a NATO ally."The whole world is against this," Cavusoglu told reporters as he awaited Tillerson\'s arrival for their meeting. He said he\'d already told Trump\'s chief diplomat that it was a "grave mistake." Cavusoglu said he planned to "tell him again."That time-tested "special relationship" with Britain? Not so special as to prevent Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson from putting Tillerson on the spot. After the two shook hands, Johnson used the occasion to suggest it was time for Trump\'s Mideast peace team to put up or shut up."Clearly this is a decision that makes it more important than ever that the long-awaited American proposals on the Middle East peace process are now brought forward, and I would say that that should happen as a matter of priority," Johnson said as Tillerson stood uneasily a few feet away.Trump, in a speech Wednesday, recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state and said he\'d start the process of moving the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv. The Palestinians and essentially every country see that as undermining future Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that would include Jerusalem\'s fate — just as the Trump administration purports to be working to broker the ever-elusive deal.Asked about Trump\'s decision, Tillerson urged critics to "listen carefully to the entirety of the speech." While the decision directly affects his department, Tillerson acknowledged his role was relatively minimal. He said Trump\'s Mideast peace team, led by the president\'s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, had shared the decision with him so he could "give them guidance on areas that I thought would be challenging to address.""They\'ve done the hard work to try to address those," Tillerson said, insisting there remains "a very good opportunity for peace to be achieved, and the president has a team that is devoted to that entirely."Tillerson has tried throughout his tenure to soften the president\'s isolationist-tinged foreign policy by explaining that the U.S. still seeks to lead and build strong partnerships with likeminded nations. He also has echoed Trump in describing how the U.S. feels burden-sharing has gotten out of balance in recent years.There are few signs America\'s foreign partners are buying it. At EU and NATO meetings this week, Tillerson got earful after earful about Trump\'s hampering of the Iran nuclear deal, withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and stated disdain for the United Nations, to name just a few examples.___Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP', 'Trevor Noah Slams Donald Trump for Jerusalem Decision - The New York TimesWelcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com.Trevor Noah reacted with alarm to President Trump’s decision on Wednesday to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel — a move that reverses seven decades of U.S. policy and threatens to further destabilize the Middle East.Mr. Noah couldn’t help taking a moment to point out that Mr. Trump had been slurring his words toward the end of his speech recognizing Jerusalem. He wondered if Mr. Trump might have been wearing dentures that came loose — and may have started a new hashtag.Other late-night hosts eagerly took the bait, too. (The slurring was pretty bad.)After a two-week break, Samantha Bee returned to the air on Wednesday with this week’s edition of “Full Frontal.” She spent most of the show addressing the latest allegations of sexual harassment against men in positions of power, focusing in particular on members of the media.Stephen Colbert reacted to the news that Time Magazine had named all “the silence breakers” who spoke out about sexual assault as its person of the year.John Cena has an uncanny knack for Mad Libs.Ms. Bee looked into the escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea, and asked an expert whether we should be worried about the prospect of war.James Franco will appear on “The Tonight Show,” presumably to talk about his new movie, the farcical “The Disaster Artist.”Our chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott, picked the top movies of the year. There was a lot of overlap: “Get Out,” “The Florida Project,” “Faces Places,” “Lady Bird,” “A Quiet Passion” and “Phantom Thread” all made both lists.', '', '', '', "Father Jonathan Morris reacts on 'The Story.'Pope Francis has suggested he wants to make a change to The Lord's Prayer, widely known among the faithful as the“Our Father.”Specifically, the Catholic leader said in an interview Wednesday he would prefer to adjust the phrase “lead us not into temptation,” saying that it too strongly suggested that God leads people to sin.“That is not a good translation,” the pope said, according toReuters.The phrase “do not let us fall into temptation,” which the Catholic Church in France has previously decided to use, would be a more appropriate alternative, Francis said.He added that the phrase used by the French, or similar wording, should then be implemented around the globe.The prayer originated from Jesus’s language of Aramaic. It was then translated to ancient Greek, and later to Latin.The pope earlier this week weighed in on President Trump's announcement that the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and would aim to move its embassy there from Tel Aviv.Francis said he was “profoundly concerned” and appealed that “everyone respects the status quo of the city.”The Associated Press contributed to this report.", 'SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico – Last week Puerto Ricans hunkered down as Hurricane Maria raked the length of the island, killing at least 16 people, wrecking the electricity grid and grinding up homes, businesses, roads and farms.After the storm passed, islanders set about digging out from the mud and debris slung by worst storm to hit the island in nearly a decade. They went in search of basic necessities: water, food, gas for a generator, a cellphone signal or a Wi-Fi hotspot to connect with relatives.All of that remains in very short supply a week later, and now many are wondering how long it will take for life to return to normal in the U.S. territory of 3.4 million.Here are the stories of some of those who lived through the storm and are struggling in its aftermath:___OFFERING WHAT YOU CANDays after the storm hit Sept. 20, Rosa Maria Almonte\'s cafe in San Juan was still without power and all the other businesses nearby were boarded up. But she still managed to serve up hot meals for people left with little in Maria\'s wake.There was no running water or electricity, but over a gas stove, her daughter cooked up rice, beans and pork chops.Almonte has run El Buen Cafe for 21 years and has seen tough times before. But the severity of the damage from Maria, and the prospect of a recovery taking weeks or months, had her wondering whether there is any point in staying."I don\'t know if I can keep going," the 73-year-old said Friday after mopping up water that seeped into the shop. The awning lay in a heap on the counter."What am I doing here?" she wondered.___ON THEIR OWNIn the northern town of Montebello, Maribel Valentin Espino and her husband said they have not seen anyone from the Puerto Rican government, much less the Federal Emergency Management Agency, since the storm tore through.She, her husband and her teenage son relied on help from relatives to find shelter when the hurricane hit. After it passed, neighbors formed volunteer brigades to cut away fallen trees and clear mountain roads after the storm. Now friends and a local cattle ranch are providing water to help them survive in the tropical heat."People say FEMA is going to help us," Valentin said Tuesday. "We\'re waiting."In Montebello, nestled in what used to be lushly forested mountains near the northern coastal municipality of Manati, Maria stripped the trees bare and scattered them like matchsticks."It seemed like a monster," Valentin recalled.The community remains isolated.___SEARCHING FOR A CONNECTIONRicardo Castellanos makes twice-daily visits to two free Wi-Fi hotspots in San Juan — among the rare places these days where Puerto Ricans can still get online and in touch with relatives across the island and overseas.Castellanos is trying to reach his two daughters in the central town of Gurabo, and he has also sent a few pictures to friends of Maria\'s devastation.Communication has become a resource nearly as precious as power and water. Some Puerto Ricans are pulling over on the side of highways in search of a stronger cell signal. Others — both on the island and elsewhere — have called a local radio station to provide names, numbers and addresses of loved ones they have yet to hear from.There is also some anger over what some say has been a lack of communication from cellphone providers about which towers are working."They\'re not giving us any information," said Castellanos, a business consultant. "We\'re in a state of emergency."___MAKING THE MOST OF A BAD SITUATIONPuerto Rico\'s economy has ground nearly to a complete halt. There are long lines at the handful of banks that have opens and limited number of ATMs that have cash. Many people are unable to work or run businesses because there\'s no electricity, or diesel to fuel generators. Stores are almost always unable to process credit or bank cards and accept only cash.But as with any crisis, there are some who weather it better than others.Elpidio Fernandez, who sells coconut and passion fruit ice cream from a pushcart in San Juan, has a supplier with a generator and says business is booming. He has made up to $500 on some days since the storm."Business has multiplied by a thousand," said Fernandez, 78, quickly adding: "Even though I\'m doing well, I don\'t feel good because I know other people are suffering."Christian Mendoza said the car wash where he works is closed so he has been selling bottled water — even though it\'s not refrigerated."The water (was) hot, and it still went like you wouldn\'t believe," he said.___STAY, OR GO?With the economy in ruins, homes in tatters and food, water and other basics in short supply, many Puerto Ricans are thinking of leaving. But others can\'t imagine life elsewhere.Israel Molina, the 68-year-old owner of Israel Mini Market in San Juan, said he has had the shop for 26 years. He bought it and rebuilt it after Hurricane Hugo hit in 1989.Parts of the roof have been ripped away, but Molina wants to stay."I\'m from here. I believe we have to step up to the task. If everyone leaves, what are we going to do? With all the pros and the cons, I will stay here," he said Friday.After a pause, he added: "I might have a different response tomorrow."Nearby, hair salon co-owner Diana Jaquez assessed the damage with help from her husband as their children played."I haven\'t decided yet," she said when asked whether she would remain.___Associated Press writers Danica Coto in San Juan and Ben Fox in Montebello contributed to this report.', 'TEL ES-SAKAN, Gaza Strip – Palestinian and French archaeologists began excavating Gaza\'s earliest archaeological site nearly 20 years ago, unearthing what they believe is a rare 4,500-year-old Bronze Age settlement.But over protests that grew recently, Gaza\'s Hamas rulers have systematically destroyed the work since seizing power a decade ago, allowing the flattening of this hill on the southern tip of Gaza City to make way for construction projects, and later military bases. In its newest project, Hamas-supported bulldozers are flattening the last remnants of excavation."There is a clear destruction of a very important archaeological site," said Palestinian archaeology and history professor Mouin Sadeq, who led three excavations at the site along with French archaeologist Pierre de Miroschedji after its accidental discovery in 1998. "I don\'t know why the destruction of the site was approved."Tel Es-Sakan (hill of ash) was the largest Canaanite city between Palestine and Egypt, according to Sadeq. It was named after the great amount of ash found during the excavations, which suggests the settlement was burnt either naturally or in a war.Archaeologists found the 10-hectare (25-acre) hill to be hiding a fortified settlement built centuries before pharaonic rule in Egypt, and 1,000 years before the pyramids. But the excavations stopped in 2002 due to security concerns.When calls on Hamas to stop the recent flattening intensified last month, the nearest available expert to gain access to Gaza was Jean-Baptiste Humbert, a Jerusalem-based archaeologist at the Ecole Biblique and who had excavated other sites in Gaza."Today the complete southern facade of the Tel is erased," said Humbert. In previous years, faces and ramparts on other sides were also destroyed. "Now it is destroyed all around," he said.It\'s among the earliest sites indicating the emergence of the "urban society" concept in the Near East, when communities were transforming from farming villages around 4,000 BC, and it was on trade routes between Egypt and the Levant, according to Humbert.Humbert shared an aerial photo from 2000 showing patterns of walls from atop the mound. The area "was the first city of Palestine to have a city wall," he said. Now, "the field work you see in the photo is totally destroyed."Gaza is home to numerous ancient treasures, but politics have long complicated archaeological work.The French excavations stopped in 2002 because of a Palestinian uprising in which protesters violently clashed with Israeli troops around the nearby Netzarim settlement. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. But Hamas, shunned by the West as a terrorist group, won elections and eventually drove out the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. The excavations never resumed.Unlike more extreme Islamic groups, Hamas has not deliberately destroyed antiquities for ideological reasons.But with little open space in Gaza, a fast-growing population and an economy stifled by Israeli and Egyptian blockades, Hamas officials say they have no choice but to develop the area, making archaeology a low priority.But the group has also seized ancient sites to build military training camps, including the 3,000-year-old Anthedon Harbor, parts of which were bulldozed in 2013.In 2009 and 2012, the expansion of universities destroyed the western and northern facades of Tel El-Sakan. People displaced during three wars between Hamas and Israel set up temporary dwellings on the eastern side.The southern front remained, but Hamas says it needs the land to compensate some of its senior employees, who have only received partial salaries from the cash-strapped group.When the bulldozer work started in early August, the Hamas-run Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities appealed for help. Humbert rushed to Gaza, and with the help of colleagues from Gaza\'s Islamic University, he succeeded in stopping the work for two weeks while the ministry and Hamas\' Land Authority worked to settle the dispute.Jamal Abu Rida, the ministry\'s director of antiquities, said Tel Es-Sakan is a protected archaeological site, but that his ministry could not stop the more powerful Land Authority from destroying another 1.2 hectares (three acres).The work resumed last week. Bulldozers loaded a truck with soil that contained fragments of jars. When the workers saw Associated Press cameras, they quickly left the scene.Abu Rida said they recovered an early Bronze Age jar from the site during the most recent leveling. Fadel al-Outul a Gaza archaeologist, salvaged fragments that he used to reassemble two thirds of another jar. He also found a flint knife blade.Junaid Sorosh-Wali, an official with the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, inspected the damage at the site Tuesday after the bulldozers left.What happened was "disastrous for the archaeology and cultural heritage in Palestine," he said. He said UNESCO had raised concerns with "the relevant authorities."Amateur videos showed ramparts crumbling under the bulldozer\'s treads. The rampart of the southern facade was also uncovered and is slated for destruction.Dozens of ancient sites have been found in Gaza, and excavations have revealed temples, monasteries, palaces, churches and mosques and mosaics. But most of the sites have been lost to urban sprawl and looting. UNESCO is struggling to preserve some of remaining ones.In 2016, the remains of a Byzantine church were discovered in Gaza, but authorities are believed to have destroyed them. And in 2014, a rare Apollo statue went missing and is believed to be held by a militant group.At St. Hilarion monastery in the central Gaza Strip, which spans from the late Roman Empire to the Islamic Umayyad period, a breach in the fence suggested looters were trying to get in. Private construction is taking place next door. Someone recently dumped brick debris in the site from over the fence.The birthplace one of the 4th century founders of Christian monasticism still has the clear remnants of a baptism hall, a church and an atrium.Sorosh-Wali, the UNESCO official, said it is among around a dozen locations in the West Bank and Gaza that the Palestinian Authority wants to be listed as a UNESCO "world heritage" sites.', 'In Jerusalem, Looking for Peace in Backgammon and Music - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — The Old City walls echoed with the clack-clack of a backgammon tournament as Israelis and Palestinians from all walks of life tried their luck with a roll of the dice.As the moon rose over the ancient stones on another night, 2,000 people, most of them Israelis but including scores of Palestinians, squeezed onto benches at an outdoor pop concert in Arabic and Hebrew.Part of the annual Mekudeshet festival, the concert was called “Kulna”— Arabic for “all of us,” and close to the Hebrew “Kulanu” of the same meaning — and was billed as “a night without borders” and a glimpse of “the Middle East of our dreams.”Just weeks earlier, the Old City and its environs seemed on the verge of explosion, the focus of mass Muslim prayers, protests and bloody clashes prompted by the latest crisis over the Aqsa Mosque compound.A deadly wave of Palestinian stabbings, shootings and car-ramming attacks that broke out two years ago is still fresh in many residents’ minds, and the 50th anniversary celebrations of Israel’s capture of East Jerusalem from Jordan in the June 1967 war only accentuated the city’s deep political, religious and social divisions.Still, after years of impasse in the peace process, a growing number of Israelis and Palestinians seem to be searching for creative ways to bypass politics, reaching across the divide to find professional peers, new resources and receptive audiences. And a number of recent events have sought to provide a common language for Israelis and Palestinians here.On Sunday, thousands of supporters of Women Wage Peace, a Jewish-Arab movement established after the Gaza war of 2014, converged, first in a reconciliation tent in the desert near Jericho in the West Bank, and then at a rally in Jerusalem. And a website, 0202, named for Jerusalem’s 02 telephone area code, translates local news into Hebrew and Arabic.Riman Barakat, an East Jerusalem-born Palestinian peace activist, is involved in both the Mekudeshet festival and Women Wage Peace. “You may think I’m naïve,” she told a group of Israelis on a recent tour of the seam between East and West Jerusalem, “but there can’t be any other way for me.”Given the history, organizing anything in this city is a complicated, risky business, particularly if it involves both Israelis from the predominantly Jewish west side and Palestinians from the east, which Israel annexed in a move that was never internationally recognized.“We understand it’s a risk, and that’s the inspiration,” said Karen Brunwasser, the deputy director of Mekudeshet, adding, “It’s all about showing people, even Jerusalemites, what they have not yet seen.”The festival producers were in the midst of selling tickets when Israel unilaterally placed metal detectors around the Aqsa Mosque compound, a contested and volatile holy site, after a shooting attack that killed two police officers.“People were phoning the box office saying they wanted to book, but is it safe?” Ms. Brunwasser said. “These are the liabilities of living in and producing a festival in Jerusalem. But when it works it’s the most extraordinary thing.”The Kulna concert brought together an eclectic cast of artists. The king of Palestinian rap from the Shuafat refugee camp in northeast Jerusalem teamed up with a Tel Aviv poet of Yemeni descent known as the angry voice of Israel’s Mizrahim, or Jews who hail from North Africa and the Middle East.An Armenian from Jerusalem’s Old City sang duets with a soulful Arab Israeli singer, and Jews sang in Hebrew and Arabic. An after-party at a club in West Jerusalem featured Palestinian hip-hop artists from East Jerusalem and, in what was probably a first, fellow rappers from Ramallah, Jericho and Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.One factor contributing to the new collaboration is the so-called Mizrahi awakening of a younger generation connecting with its Arab cultural roots.The after-party was organized by the Jerusalem disc jockey Ram Spinoza, a.k.a. DJ Ramzy, whose grandmother came from Syria, and who specializes in contemporary Middle Eastern music. Mr. Spinoza, who served in the Israeli Air Force, regularly holds his signature “Monolingua” parties in West Jerusalem’s alternative music venues, letting the music do the talking.“I stopped hoping for a peace agreement,” Mr. Spinoza said in an interview, “so I do it my own way — I live the peace.” Of the more traditional methods of fostering coexistence in the city, he added: “Dialogue groups are not the best fun. This is fun.”Mr. Spinoza often hosts Palestinian rappers like the duo Muzi Raps, from the Old City, and Raed Bassem Jabid, from the Palestinian neighborhood of At-Tur on the Mount of Olives. “If you’re looking for peace,” Mr. Jabid said, “you’ll find the peace.”Even in peacetime, though, attempts to escape politics can be viewed as political. Many Palestinians, for instance, reject what they call cultural normalization with the Israelis.The Jerusalem-Armenian musician, Apo Sahagian, whose  guitar was recently held by the Israeli airport authorities for extra security screening, appeared to be grappling with those sensitivities.On the day of the Kulna concert, a post appeared on the Facebook page of Apo & the Apostles, Mr. Sahagian’s band, denying rumors that it was scheduled to perform in Jerusalem. The band, most of whose members come from Bethlehem, in the West Bank, declined to comment and the post appears to have been taken down.The backgammon tournament did break down a few barriers. The idea came about when a group of Israeli and Palestinian activists took a break from a tense brainstorming session and looked for an activity that would let people engage with one another. They ended up playing backgammon.Karem Jubran, a Palestinian from the Shuafat camp, said his friends came to the tournament for “the love of the game.”A youth from the camp, Abdullah Jubran, 16, said he had taught himself to play by watching YouTube and hoped to win the 25,000 shekel (almost $7,000) prize. He was knocked out of the competition early, though a friend of his father reached the finals.Hundreds of players faced off across rows of tables in qualifying rounds in the Armenian and Jewish quarters of the Old City and on the grassy verge outside the Damascus Gate to the Muslim quarter, the scene of numerous attacks in the past two years.Zaki Djemal, an Israeli of Syrian descent and a founder of the tournament, acknowledged that many of the Israeli players assigned to the Damascus Gate area were frightened and asked to be moved.But Mr. Djemal said he was not nervous. “It’s a state of mind,” he said.', 'A top DHS official also warns terrorists want to pull off another 9/11; Catherine Herridge goes in-depth for \'Special Report.\'WASHINGTON – Islamic State militants are capable of orchestrating and carrying out an attack against the United States, possibly downing an airplane, even after being evicted from their self-declared Syrian capital of Raqqa, the CIA director said Thursday.Mike Pompeo said the U.S. is threatened by other militant groups as well."IS\' capability to conduct an external operation remains," Pompeo said. "But I wouldn\'t put them in a singular bucket. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has for a long time had this mission statement, which includes the taking down of a commercial airliner bound for a western country. Certainly, among those would be the United States."Speaking a day after President Donald Trump\'s acting homeland security chief invoked the possibility of another 9/11-style attack, Pompeo said America\'s enemies around the world "are intent upon using commercial aviation as their vector to present a threat to the West." However, he also worried about a terrorist capability "we just don\'t see."The typically blunt threat assessment came during a wide-ranging discussion at a Washington think tank, in which Pompeo also underscored President Donald Trump\'s intent to counteract North Korea. He said Pyongyang is only months away from perfecting its nuclear weapons capabilities."They are closer now than they were five years ago, and I expect they will be closer in five months than they are today, absent a global effort to push back against them," Pompeo said. "From a U.S. policy perspective, we ought to behave as if we are on the cusp of them achieving that objective."On another nuclear concern, Iran, Pompeo stressed that Trump wants to ensure the U.S. foe has no pathway to developing the bomb. To that effect, he said, the Iran nuclear deal President Barack Obama and America\'s allies negotiated with Iran was insufficient.The notion that the agreement would "curtail Iranian adventurism or their terror threat or their malignant behavior has now ... two years on, proven to be fundamentally false," said Pompeo, a former Republican congressman from Kansas who keenly opposed to the seven-nation accord when it was reached.He said the Iran deal put the United States in a better place with respect to inspections of Iranian facilities. But from an intelligence perspective, he said, even more "intrusive inspection" is needed."The Iranians have on multiple occasions been capable of presenting a continued threat, through covert efforts to develop their nuclear program along multiple dimensions ... the missile dimension, the weaponization effort, the nuclear component itself," he said.Trump has provided the CIA with the authority it needs to track Iran\'s compliance with the deal, he said.Pompeo also said it\'s an "open secret" that Iran has links to al-Qaida."There have been relationships, there are connections. There have been times the Iranians have worked alongside al-Qaida," Pompeo said. "There have been connections where, at the very least, they have cuts deals so as not to come after each other."Pompeo and Trump\'s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, who also spoke at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies event, both said the U.S. must counter Iran\'s aggression in the region. They noted Iran\'s support for the Lebanon\'s Hezbollah militants, who threaten Israel; backing of Shia militias in Iraq and Syria; cyber activities; ballistic missile efforts; and a long history of proliferation ties with North Korea.Pompeo said Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard Corps controls as much as 20 percent of the Iranian economy. McMaster said the United States needs to raise the cloak on the IRGC\'s financial network and urge companies worldwide not to do business with it."Don\'t enrich the IRGC," McMaster said. "Don\'t enable their murderous campaign. Don\'t enable their threat to our friends in the region, especially Israel, but also Saudi Arabia and others."Pompeo also discussed Pakistan\'s help in getting an American woman, her Canadian husband and three children released last week from the Haqqani militant network. The couple had been held for five years inside Pakistan, he said.', 'Iranian state television claimed footage showed the launch of a new type of medium-range ballistic missile; U.S. officials say footage is from failed launch in late JanuaryEXCLUSIVE:Iranian state television released video footage Friday claiming to show the launch of a new type of medium-range ballistic missile, a few hours after it was displayed during a military parade in Tehran.But it turns out Iran never fired a ballistic missile, sources say.The video released by the Iranians was more than seven months old – dating back to a failed launch in late January, which resulted in the missile exploding shortly after liftoff, according to two U.S. officials.President Trump had originally responded to the reported launch in a late-Saturday tweet, saying, “Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel. They are also working with North Korea. Not much of an agreement we have!”This was after Trump, speaking before world leaders at the United Nations, called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” to the United States. “We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program,” he said.Trump later told reporters he had made up his mind about the deal, but wouldn\'t say whether he would pull the United States out of the nuclear accord with Iran.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, speaking at the U.N. one day after Trump, maintained his country’s missile program was “solely defensive” in nature.“We never threaten anyone, but we do not tolerate threats from anyone,” he said. Rouhani returned to Tehran two days later to preside over the missile parade featuring the new medium-range design and said his country would build as many missiles as necessary to defend itself. Afterward, the footage was aired, with Iranian media claiming a successful test launch – though it apparently showed the failed January launch.Video: #Iran successfully test-fires new ballistic missileDetails: https://t.co/eKHi0jXnED pic.twitter.com/30XkB8ddbPAt the time, Iran was attempting to launch its new Khorramshahr medium-range ballistic missile for the first time.It flew 600 miles before exploding, in a failed test of a reentry vehicle, officials said at the time.The failed late January launch was first reported by Fox News and prompted the White House to put Iran “on notice” days later.Iran’s new medium-range missile is based on a North Korean design—Pyongyang’s BM-25 Musudan ballistic missile, which has a maximum range of nearly 2,500 miles, putting U.S. forces in the Middle East and Israel within reach if its problems are fixed.“The very first missiles we saw in Iran were simply copies of North Korean missiles,” said Jeffrey Lewis, a missile proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. “Over the years, we\'ve seen photographs of North Korean and Iranian officials in each other\'s countries, and we\'ve seen all kinds of common hardware.” Last weekend, a senior Iranian general said the missile had a range of less than 2,000 miles."The Khoramshahr missile has a range of 2,000 kilometers [1,250 miles]and can carry multiple warheads," Iran’s official IRNA news agency quoted Revolutionary Guards aerospace chief General Amir Ali Hajizadeh as saying.“I am not sure why the Iranians are lying about the range,” one U.S. official said. “I think they don’t want to piss the Europeans off.”The official and others declined to be identified because they were not authorized to disclose sensitive information to the press.Experts say Iran possesses the largest arsenal of ballistic missiles in the Middle East, with more than 1,000 short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Tehran has conducted over 20 missile tests since 2015.According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Iran is “supplying proxies such as Hezbollah and Syria’s al-Assad regime with a steady supply of missiles and rockets” and “likely supplying Houthi rebel groups with short-range missiles in the ongoing conflict in Yemen.”U.N. resolution 2231 -- put in place days after the Iran nuclear deal was signed -- calls on the Islamic Republic not to conduct ballistic missile tests, but does not forbid them from doing so, after Russia and China insisted on the watered-down language in order to pass the resolution.Iran is "called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology," according to the text of the resolution.Iran claims the tests are legitimate because they are defensive in nature.

It will serve the Iranians.”Iran, he pointed out, is complying with the terms of the agreement. It will “continue to harvest” the economic benefits of the deal. But if Mr. Trump disavowed it, that would give the Iranians a pretext for resuming their drive toward a nuclear “breakout” capability, particularly in the latter years of the agreement, when the economic benefits are outweighed by Iran’s desire to join the club of nuclear states.The lessons of a broken deal will not be lost on North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, Mr. Barak said. “They will say it makes no sense negotiating with the Americans if they can pull out of a deal that has been signed, unilaterally, after a relatively short time.”An unconstrained North Korea could impel Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons, he said. In the Middle East, Iran’s renewed drive for a bomb would pressure neighbors like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey to do likewise.“Think what happens in the next generation if Iran turns nuclear,” he said. “It’s become almost inevitable that we are entering a totally different international landscape.”As Mr. Trump’s expected decision draws closer, other prominent Israelis are urging him not to decline to certify the agreement. Uzi Arad, a former top Mossad official who served as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser, traveled to Washington last week to lobby Republicans on Capitol Hill to preserve the agreement.On Tuesday, Condoleezza Rice, who served as President George W. Bush’s secretary of state, added her voice to those urging Mr. Trump not to disavow the deal, which was negotiated by the Obama administration. “The United States wants to be seen as living up to the obligations that it’s undertaken from president to president to president,” she said on Fox News.Mr. Barak’s advocacy for the deal is particularly significant because, as Israel’s defense minister from 2007 to 2013, he led the preparations for a possible military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities. He warned then that if the Israelis did not act at some point, Iran’s effort to produce a bomb would no longer be vulnerable to any military action.He and Mr. Netanyahu were closely aligned in that view, but they faced resistance from the chiefs of Israel’s intelligence agencies, who argued that a military strike could have catastrophic consequences and that they were exaggerating the imminence of the Iranian threat.President Barack Obama implored Mr. Netanyahu to give American efforts at pressure and diplomacy time to work, which he did grudgingly. But the prime minister never liked the resulting agreement. He lobbied against it in the United States Congress and encouraged Mr. Trump to try to renegotiate its terms. (Israel is not part of the deal.)“Change it, or cancel it,” Mr. Netanyahu said at the United Nations last month. “Fix it, or nix it.”Under the action being contemplated by the White House, Mr. Trump would essentially kick the agreement to Congress, which would have to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran — a step that would almost certainly blow up the deal — or use the threat of renewed sanctions to try to force the Iranians to renegotiate parts of the agreement.“Like many Israelis,” Mr. Barak said, “I think the Iran deal is a bad deal. But it is a done deal.”With the agreement in place, he said, “Iran is far from being an existential threat to Israel.” But he added, “It carries all the potential of turning into an existential threat in the longer-term” — a scenario made more, not less likely, by walking away from the deal, he said.While refusing to certify the agreement would be politically satisfying for Mr. Trump, Mr. Barak said, it would also not help the United States in its campaign to curb Iran’s ballistic missile program, its support for terrorist organizations, or its cyberwarfare operations.For Mr. Barak, the implications for North Korea are just as far-reaching. The United States, he said, had no military option to destroy the North’s nuclear facilities because of the massive retaliation that the North Korean leader would inflict on South Korea. That leaves only a strategy of negotiations, backed by sanctions, to coerce the North to curb its behavior.“Kim Jong-un is extreme,” Mr. Barak said. “But he is totally predictable and almost transparent — simple to understand. He just doesn’t want to experience what happened to Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein. Basically, there is no way he will give up his nuclear intentions.”Mr. Barak, now 75 and a nonresident senior fellow at the Belfer Center at Harvard, said the bellicose threats between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump raised the risks of a miscalculation that could lead to war.“No one personally remembers the Cuban crisis or the Berlin crisis,” he said. “People at the leadership level don’t have the fingertip feel for how easily the world situation can cascade.”', 'Trump Unlikely to Name Top Two Fed Officials at Same Time, Mnuchin Says - The New York TimesABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — President Trump, who has several spots to fill at the Federal Reserve, is expected to nominate its next chairman this coming week but is unlikely to simultaneously tap a vice chairman at the same time, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday, eliminating one potential twist in a selection process being closely watched on Wall Street.Speaking to reporters aboard a military aircraft during a weeklong Middle East trip, Mr. Mnuchin did not drop any hints as to who Mr. Trump might pick but said that he had been discussing the Fed decision with Mr. Trump while he was traveling and that the focus was on naming the next chairman.“I think for the moment we’re focused on the Fed chair decision. That’s really the focus at the moment,” Mr. Mnuchin said. He added that market reaction to the pick was not a “primary consideration” in whom Mr. Trump plans to choose to lead the Fed.Mr. Trump has turned the Fed pick into a very public display and has on several occasions named those he is considering. The roster appears to have narrowed to Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor who has voted in favor of every Fed policy decision since 2012 and John B. Taylor, a Stanford economist who has been critical of the central bank. However, Mr. Trump has also said he remains a fan of the Fed’s current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, whose term expires next year.While he would not comment on any of the candidates on Mr. Trump’s shortlist, Mr. Mnuchin said he did have a positive rapport with Ms. Yellen.“I do have a good relationship with Yellen,” said Mr. Mnuchin, who was careful not to tip his hand. “I expect whoever is appointed by the president as Fed chair, I would expect to have a very good relationship with.”Mr. Mnuchin is in the midst of a four-country swing to discuss efforts to combat terrorist financing. He held meetings with business leaders and government officials in Saudi Arabia and Israel and on Saturday was en route to the United Arab Emirates, which he will visit before finishing his trip in Qatar on Monday.The possibility of more sanctions on Iran has been an important topic of discussion with his counterparts in the Middle East, said Mr. Mnuchin, who criticized the Iranians for violating various United Nations resolutions and creating problems in the region. Earlier this week, Mr. Mnuchin commemorated the establishment of a new center in Saudi Arabia targeting terrorist financing that is a collaborative effort between the United States and several Gulf nations.The Treasury’s lack of action on new Russia sanctions mandated by Congress has irked some Senate Republicans. Mr. Mnuchin said in the interview that he had been in touch this past week with Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, to discuss the status of those sanctions. The Trump administration missed a deadline imposed by Congress to start the process, but Mr. Mnuchin denied that the administration was dragging its feet.“We expect that to come out in the near future,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “It’s a lot of specific details to go through, but there’s no specific delay per say.”The Middle East trip comes at a hectic time for the Trump administration’s domestic agenda. Not only is the Fed decision expected this coming week, but Republicans in the House of Representatives are due to release tax legislation on Wednesday.Mr. Mnuchin said he had been having daily telephone calls with his Treasury colleagues and with lawmakers in the House and Senate as they put the finishing touches on a tax bill. Despite the fact that they have been working on a plan since January, Mr. Mnuchin said there were still “active discussions” taking place over various provisions. Those include finding a way to prevent a new 25 percent tax rate for “pass through” businesses from becoming a loophole that would allow wealthy individuals to lower their tax bills. And he said it was too soon to say if Republicans would fully repeal the state and local tax deduction, which allows homeowners to deduct property and state and local income taxes from their federal tax bill.“We’ve been having a lot of discussions on the SALT issue,” Mr. Mnuchin said, using the acronym for the deduction, “and what the impact of that is in several states that are a big part of the economy.”Mr. Mnuchin said on Saturday that he remained optimistic that the tax cuts could be passed and signed by the president by December.“If we could do it quicker, that would be great,” he said.Mr. Mnuchin also said it was difficult to define which American families should be defined as middle class or rich — a key question lawmakers face as they set income levels for new tax brackets. He said that relative wealth varies with states’ and cities’ cost of living but that his priority is for people around the national median income level to get tax cuts.In Saudi Arabia and Israel, where Mr. Trump is popular, Mr. Mnuchin drew a warm welcome.Mr. Mnuchin, his wife, Louise Linton, and a Treasury delegation toured the Old City of Jerusalem for more than an hour on Friday. Several onlookers who recognized him approached to shake hands, offer praise and pose for photographs.Surrounded by a phalanx of Secret Service agents, Mr. Mnuchin and his group meandered though the stone pathways of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish quarters. They also visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and the Western Wall, where Mr. Mnuchin prayed and inscribed the guest book at one of the most holy sites in Judaism.After his prayer, Mr. Mnuchin expressed hope for strength, peace and prosperity.', 'Hezbollah Urges ‘Patience and Calm’ Amid Lebanon’s Political Crisis - The New York TimesBEIRUT, Lebanon — Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, called on Sunday for “patience and calm” in Lebanon, seeking to reassure a country thrown into uncertainty a day after the surprise resignation of the prime minister, Saad Hariri.Fears for Lebanon’s stability were running high after Mr. Hariri declared his resignation in a speech televised from Riyadh, the Saudi capital, attacking Saudi Arabia’s regional rival Iran and its ally Hezbollah. The Shiite militia and political party is the strongest faction in Lebanon.The move was widely seen as having been orchestrated by Mr. Hariri’s patrons, the Saudis, to isolate Hezbollah by collapsing Lebanon’s national unity government, which included both it and Mr. Hariri’s Sunni faction. Saudi Arabia has been taking increasingly aggressive steps to curb Iran’s growing dominance in the region.Lebanon has long been a flash point for regional tensions, and there are fears that if it becomes the latest stage for the escalating rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran — as war-torn Syria has been in recent years — the tiny Mediterranean country could face economic collapse or even violence.On Sunday, Bahrain urged its citizens to leave Lebanon for their safety, and the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, issued a statement expressing concern about Mr. Hariri’s resignation and calling on all sides to safeguard Lebanon’s state institutions and its “security and stability.”Mr. Nasrallah called the resignation “very destabilizing” and rejected Mr. Hariri’s accusations of Iranian interference in Lebanon. He also pointed out the irony of his making them from Saudi Arabia, and said, “We, Hezbollah, did not wish for this.”But he urged people not to engage in street protests or “sectarian tensions,” and “not to fear and worry,” adding, “Civil peace in Lebanon is the most precious.”Mr. Nasrallah said he expected Mr. Hariri to return to Lebanon on Thursday — “if he is allowed to come back” — and talk with President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, who has yet to accept the resignation.“It was definitely a Saudi decision that was imposed on him,” said Mr. Nasrallah. “It was not his will to step down.”A satirical website, “Free Saad Hariri,” has already appeared, with a time counter showing how long it had been since he resigned. It was reminiscent of a billboard Mr. Hariri maintains in Beirut to count the days waiting for justice after the 2005 assassination of his father, Rafik Hariri, a former prime minister.Sami Nader, an economist at St. Joseph University in Beirut, said Mr. Nasrallah appeared to be “trying to de-escalate the situation and contain it” because the resignation, which leaves Hezbollah without a Sunni governing partner, could strip it of “legal and political cover.”It could also make the Lebanese government more vulnerable to sanctions against the group, which is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States.Mr. Nasrallah also sought to tamp down fears that the prime minister’s resignation exposed Lebanon to a new war with Israel, where high-ranking officials have lately argued that Hezbollah and the Lebanese government are one and the same. If Israel wanted to wage a war, he said, it would do so regardless of whether Mr. Hariri was in government or not.Mr. Hariri had warned of a plot against his life, and Saudi news outlets said one had been foiled last week. But the Lebanese Army and internal security forces said they knew of no such attempt.The unity government was meant to contain rifts in Lebanon exacerbated by the war in Syria, where Iran and Saudi Arabia and their respective Lebanese partners have supported opposite sides. It has produced some results after years of political deadlock: a new electoral law, budget talks, a tax law and even a decision on the contentious issue of appointing an ambassador to Damascus.But while Mr. Hariri has made many concessions to Hezbollah — tolerating its growing involvement in Syria and its adoption of state functions like negotiating hostage releases and fighting militants on the borders — Hezbollah has not made as many concessions to him, angering his base. That meant Mr. Hariri could have faced challenges in elections planned for May.Now, it remains unclear if those elections will take place, or what the next steps are in the governance crisis. The two most likely Sunni politicians — under Lebanon’s sect-based power-sharing system, the prime minister must be Sunni — former prime ministers Najib Mikati and Fouad Siniora, have said they are not interested.If Mr. Aoun and the Parliament decide on an openly pro-Hezbollah figure, the country could face new isolation. It is unlikely they could settle on an openly anti-Hezbollah political figure.Mr. Hariri, perhaps seeking to dispel rumors he was under arrest in Saudi Arabia, posted on Twitter for the first time since his resignation speech, posing with the new Saudi ambassador to Lebanon.Lebanese supporters and opponents of Mr. Hariri’s faction said the country would soldier on with or without him.“Hariri? What does that have to do with us? Everyone in this area is against him anyway,” said Mohammad Shabban, the owner of a shawarma shop. “Saudi tells him what to do. They say go-go, he goes-goes; they say come come, he comes.”', 'Alia Shawkat on Growing Up and Gaining Control - The New York TimesLittle Dory Sief, the amateur sleuth of TBS’s “Search Party,” is all grown up now, and so are the mysteries surrounding her.“The first season was Nancy Drew, about searching for something and finding yourself through it,” said Alia Shawkat, who plays Dory. “And now it’s more like Hitchcock, where she’s doubting everything she sees or feels and doesn’t know who to trust because everything she thought was real isn’t.” (The show returns on Sunday, Nov. 19.)In Season 1, Dory — a doormat of a personal assistant on a quest for meaning — took her Brooklyn brat pack on a wildly convoluted hunt for Chantal (Clare McNulty), a college classmate who had disappeared and was presumed dead. Among the finale’s revelations: Chantal was alive in Montreal, oblivious to the chaos her absence had caused. And Keith (Ron Livingston), the private detective Dory hooked up with in the belief that he was working for Chantal’s family, had met his bloody demise. Or had he?Charmingly forthright and smokey-voiced, Ms. Shawkat, 28, spoke about Dory’s future, her roles in “Transparent” and “Arrested Development,” and sexual harassment in Hollywood. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.Now that she has located Chantal, where should we expect to find Dory?The most interesting shows are when you watch an evolution of the character. Dory started off very lost. Her kindness was misinterpreted for weakness. Then she discovered something that she was good at, that she cared about because she thought it was helping other people. She’s been so blindly self-obsessed that she didn’t realize she’d alienated those closest to her. So, in the second season, she’s unveiling that she’s not what she thought she was.“Search Party” has been called one of the most realistic portrayals of millennials on TV. Millennials definitely think that they’re doing something for somebody else, when it’s actually just a selfish act. The show’s main characters are kind of despicable people, and at the end, Dory realizes that she’s actually the worst off. And I think they’re relatable because the creators Charles Rogers and Sarah-Violet Bliss write as if they’re people they’ve known for a long time, where you know their worst qualities but still really care about them.In Season 4 of “Transparent,” you play a sex addict in a three-way with Sarah and Len. You’ve said you like being naked onscreen.Honestly, I don’t think it’s going to get any better physically. I’m at my peak. But yeah, if it’s right for the story, then it completely makes sense to me. In the work I’ve done, I’ve communicated what I want it to be and set up safe environments. There’s so much power in a naked woman’s body. And that’s how you reclaim being naked in front of someone — because it’s not about how people are going to look at me, it’s about how I feel in my body.The season also takes the Pfefferman family to Israel, and Ali visits Ramallah in the West Bank.Weirdly, art very much mimicked life with that show. I come from an Arab family; my father is Muslim, and so I have grown up always pro-Palestine. Right before reading the script for “Transparent,” I decided to visit Palestine, and I stayed in Ramallah. It was a lot of young, amazing, vibrant artists actively talking about the situation but then laughing in the next breath. When I got back and we read these scripts, I was like, “This is insane.” Jill [Soloway, the show’s creator] gives so much to Jewish faith, but she made such a beautiful point without demonizing Israel.A fifth season of “Arrested Development” will come out on Netflix next year. You originated the role of Maeby Fünke half a lifetime ago.Maeby is in many disguises this time around. And the whole family is back together a lot more, which has been fun. Michael Cera and I talk all the time about how we’re literally standing on the exact same sets, in the same position, as when we were 14.You’ve acted since you were 8. What do you make of the allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein and the subsequent ripple effect?It’s not just a ripple effect, it’s an earthquake. It’s a restructuring so powerful and raw and upsetting. It feels like a personal war. I’ve looked back at times I thought I had under control, where I now go, “I should have said something instead of laughing it off.” Now I don’t feel nervous to call somebody out and say, “That’s inappropriate.” Especially in the comedy world, a lot of inappropriate things fly. And I was always the funny girl in the group, but still the girl, and never considered as funny or able to keep up. And I don’t care about the opinion of some guy, like Woody Allen’s let’s not make this a witch hunt. You say that as like, “Let’s be chill.” And I’m like, “[Expletive] be chill.”', '                                    Pixar\'s \'Coco\' dominated \'Justice League\' at the Thanksgiving box office.

According to studio estimates Sunday, it grossed $49 million from Friday to Sunday. Centered on the Mexican holiday Dia de Los Muertos (Day of the Dead), "Coco" has already set box office records in Mexico, where it has made $53.4 million in three weeks.After a disappointing debut last weekend, the much-maligned DC Comics superhero team-up film "Justice League" slid to second with $40.7 million. In the five-day holiday frame, it earned about $60 million. "Justice League" is faring better overseas, where it has made more than $300 million.The two top spots told a familiar tale: Quality is trumping mediocrity at the box office, where Rotten Tomato ratings bear considerable weight and where word-of-mouth spreads lightning quick. "Coco" is Pixar\'s sixth release to land an A-plus CinemaScore from audiences. The film\'s Rotten Tomatoes rating, 96 percent fresh, is more than double that of "Justice League" (41 percent)."In a world where moviegoing and quality seem to be connected, having a brand that has as consistently as Pixar has delivered on very high expectations definitely makes our work a little easier," said Dave Hollis, distribution chief for the Walt Disney Co., which owns Pixar. "Consumers have really come to expect high quality. This is once again Pixar doing what they do best."The success of "Coco" came just as reports of sexual misconduct were published regarding Pixar co-founder and Disney Animation Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter. On Tuesday, Lasseter announced that he was taking "a six-month sabbatical." He acknowledged "missteps" and "unwanted hugs" with employees. Disney has said it supports Lasseter\'s leave of absence.Lasseter has been foundational to the rise of Pixar and the revitalization of Disney Animation. "Coco" is the latest in a long line of hits he\'s overseen.After some early blunders (Disney tried to trademark "Dia de Los Muertos," sparking a backlash), the studio strove to capture Mexican culture authentically in "Coco," enlisting cultural consultants for their feedback. The film, directed by Lee Unkrich and co-directed by Adrian Molina, is one of the largest U.S. productions ever to feature a largely all-Latino cast.That makes "Coco" an anomaly in the Pixar canon but also in Hollywood. Hispanics made up 23 percent of frequent moviegoers last year, but they\'re seldom catered to. Disney didn\'t share ethnic demographics for "Coco" ticket buyers but said signs pointed to a high turnout among Latinos."Telling great stories that represent the audience is a part of what makes a film successful, especially when you get it right," said Hollis.Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore, called the film\'s result a positive story in "a week that was pretty challenging for Pixar.""The future may lie in content like this, where you\'re telling stories about real human beings and about diversity," said Dergarabedian. "The Hispanic audience is key to the success of any given box office year, given the frequency and passion for moviegoing."Still, the most profitable movie currently at the box office might be the Lionsgate family release "Wonder," directed by Stephen Chbosky. Starring Jacob Tremblay and Julia Roberts, the film — which carries a production budget of $20 million — has made $69.4 million. It slid just 19 percent in its second week, with $22.3 million in ticket sales.A number of specialty releases with Oscar ambitions also hit theaters over the weekend. Of them, Sony Pictures Classics\' "Call Me By Your Name" came out with the best per-screen average: $101,219 in four theaters. Not since "La La Land" has a film so packed theaters in specialty release. The movie, starring Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer, is about a young man\'s coming of age in 1980s Northern Italy."Darkest Hour," with Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill, debuted with $176,000 on four screens. The expanding releases of Greta Gerwig\'s "Lady Bird" ($4 million on 791 screens) and Martin McDonaugh\'s "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri" ($4.4 million on 614 screens) also drew crowded theaters.Less successful was the national rollout of "Roman J. Israel, Esq." with Denzel Washington. Though it bested the other releases with $4.5 million on 1,665 screens, it\'s an atypical downturn for one of the movies\' most consistently bankable stars. Not since Washington\'s 2002 directorial debut, "Antwone Fisher," has a film starring Washington performed as weakly nationwide.Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore.

He was 84.His daughter Abigail Gillman confirmed the death and said he had been treated for cancer.Rabbi Gillman, a professor of Jewish philosophy at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan for 46 years and dean of its rabbinical school for 10, began publishing his writings in the 1980s. At the time, the centrist Conservative movement was struggling with identity and appeal, wondering if its adherents were merely stopping over on their way to becoming barely observant Jews whose allegiance was largely ethnic rather than religious.It was a movement, he said, in a comment sometimes attributed to others, that consisted of “an Orthodox faculty teaching Conservative rabbis to minister to Reform Jews.”His ideas helped two generations of rabbis as well as teachers and scholars define their enigmatic ideas about God and faith. They also shaped the movement’s approach to Jewish law and beliefs.Rabbi Gillman’s breakthrough for thinking about divinity began with his notion of a “second naïveté.” Children conceive of God as perhaps a giant bearded figure in the sky, and Rabbi Gillman wanted his listeners to find ways “to rediscover that innocent sense of awe and wonder,” but in ways that made sense to them as adults, said Rabbi Julie Schonfeld, chief executive of the Rabbinical Assembly, the movement’s rabbinic arm.The path toward understanding God in more personal terms can be found in biblical stories, or “myths,” Rabbi Gillman wrote. In Genesis, for example, Abraham argues with a wrathful but undecided God about how many righteous inhabitants it would take to save the wicked populace of Sodom and Gomorrah from divine annihilation.“Consider the image of God portrayed in this story,” Rabbi Gillman wrote. “God deliberates, is conflicted, has feelings, invites consultation, is willing to change the divine plan, is open to negotiation and needs to be true to previous commitments. Above all, God has an intense relationship with an individual human being.”That was an existentialist conception that many rabbinical students could grapple with. Whether the Bible stories were historically factual, he said, was less important than the values they conveyed.Rabbi Ira Stone, the rabbi emeritus at Temple Beth Zion-Beth Israel in Philadelphia, said in an interview that “students came to the seminary because they were searching for religious meaning, and Neil was the one who took that challenge seriously.”Rabbi Gillman’s book “Sacred Fragments: Recovering Theology for the Modern Jew” (1990) won the National Jewish Book Award for Jewish thought.In the 1970s, when the Conservative movement began debating whether to expand women’s roles, he clashed with more traditionalist colleagues and championed a broader vision, including ordination to the rabbinate. The seminary faculty approved women’s ordination in 1983 and ordained its first female rabbi two years later.He also argued for the ordination of gay, bisexual and lesbian rabbis, which the movement approved in 2006. Same-sex marriage ceremonies were approved in 2012, with the caveat that the marriages do not carry the status of kiddushin, which consecrates a marriage between a bridegroom and a bride “according to the laws of Moses and Israel.”Rabbi Gillman, a genial man recognizable by his goatee and tufts of white hair, often puffed or chomped on a pipe as he threw ideas around with students in an office crammed with towers of books. Those ideas also reached beyond rabbinical circles to lay people through frequent talks he gave at synagogues — Reform and Reconstructionist as well as Conservative — on so-called scholar-in-residence weekends.In his book “The Death of Death: Resurrection and Immortality in Jewish Thought” (1997), Rabbi Gillman chronicled the evolution of Jewish ideas on death and the afterlife. He pointed out that in daily prayers God is praised for reviving the dead and that in the song that concludes the Passover Seder, “Chad Gadya,” the Angel of Death is killed by God. Therefore, he said, resurrection, including bodily resurrection, is a concept Jews should be wrestling with.“Not that he believed in literal resurrection,” Rabbi Stone said. “What he believed was that the myth contained profound truth. The body was as holy as the soul. And a philosophy that focused on human beings as disembodied beings ultimately was false. The body is sacred, is a temple. Human beings exist body and soul.”Neil Gillman was born on Sept. 11, 1933, in Quebec City, which at the time had a community of roughly 120 Jewish families with no yeshiva and no kosher butcher. His father, Ernest, an immigrant from Russia, took over his father-in-law’s clothing factory, and his mother, Rebecca, was the bookkeeper. Young Neil was greatly influenced by his immigrant grandmother, Devorah Gardner, and her commitment to keeping Jewish customs.He majored in philosophy and French literature at McGill University in Montreal and there heard Will Herberg, a sociologist of religion, speak about Jewish philosophy.“It was a life-changing encounter,” Abigail Gillman said.Rabbi Gillman decided to pursue the subject but was advised to first ground himself in Jewish texts. At the Jewish Theological Seminary, he was influenced by the towering intellectuals Mordecai Kaplan and Abraham Joshua Heschel.He was ordained in 1960 and soon teaching seminary students. Simultaneously, he studied secular philosophy at nearby Columbia University, receiving his doctorate in 1975.In addition to his daughter Abigail, Rabbi Gillman is survived by his wife, Sarah Fisher Gillman; another daughter, Deborah Gillman; a sister, Betsy Friedman; and five grandchildren.', 'Paperback Row - The New York TimesSix new paperbacks to check out this week.THE ANGEL: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel, by Uri Bar-Joseph.

President Trump has made attacking terrorist financing a priority in his first year in office, and the Treasury has been increasingly working with Persian Gulf countries to freeze the assets of people who are plotting attacks.The Terrorist Financing Targeting Center was established in May during Mr. Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia. Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are also members of the group, and have agreed to share information about the financing of terrorism.“Our enemies have felt the effects of being blocked from the world financial system,” Mr. Mnuchin said in a speech at the Future Investment Initiative summit in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. “They are finding it harder to raise, move and distribute money.”The United States has in recent months imposed sanctions to stem North Korea’s financing and development of weapons of mass destruction and earlier this month targeted Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Mr. Mnuchin said he is also focused on targeting fund-raising efforts that prop up the Taliban in Afghanistan and Hezbollah in Lebanon.Among the individuals sanctioned on Wednesday were Abu Sulayman al-Adani, the head of the Islamic State’s Yemen affiliate, Nashwan al-Wali al-Yafi’I, the group’s chief financial officer, and Khalid al-Marfadi, a militant who helped coordinate joint operations between the Islamic State and Al Qaeda in Yemen.This week Mr. Mnuchin is also traveling to Israel, where he will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, before heading to the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.Despite the commitment for more coordination between the countries, Mr. Mnuchin’s trip comes at a particularly complicated time for the region. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut ties with Qatar and imposed a travel blockade on the country over allegations that it supports terrorism. Since then the administration has been attempting to ease tension between the countries.The Treasury secretary traveled to the region with a delegation that included Sigal Mandelker, the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, and Dina Powell, the administration’s deputy national security adviser. Mr. Mnuchin traveled on a Boeing 737 military plane and was accompanied by his wife, Louise Linton.A former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood film producer, Mr. Mnuchin has acknowledged that targeting terrorists is a new world for him. However, he has said that he spends about half of his time dealing with national security issues and in June suggested that he would like more funding to build up the department’s terrorism and financial crimes unit.Mr. Mnuchin’s first trip to the region also comes at a frenzied time for his domestic agenda. He has been advising Mr. Trump as he weighs his choices for the next chairman of the Federal Reserve and a decision is expected to come within days.Meanwhile, the Republicans in the House are expected to unveil legislation to overhaul the tax code as early as next week. Mr. Mnuchin is the administration’s point person for selling the plan.International investors have been keeping a close eye on the machinations over the tax bill in the United States, and on Wednesday Mr. Mnuchin said that a coming mix of tax cuts and deregulation would soon make America’s economy more competitive.“It has been over 30 years since we have had comprehensive tax reform in our country,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “This has hurt our workers, made our businesses uncompetitive, and left trillions of dollars of American business profits offshore.”He added: “We are working to change this.”', "Crew embark on the first of a trio of October spacewalks to perform maintenance on the International Space Station.MIAMI – As every homeowner on earth knows all too well, every now and then you have to make repairs.And that’s exactly what’s going on in space during the next two weeks, 250 miles up above us.There are three scheduled spacewalks that are all about International Space Station maintenance.On Thursday, two American astronauts, Commander Randy Breznik and Flight Engineer Mark Vande Hei, exited the air-lock, climbing out into microgravity as the Space Station passed above the eastern Mediterranean Sea.In this frame from NASA TV, Astronauts Mark Vande Hei, left, and Randy Bresnik work on the International Space Station on Thursday, Oct. 5, 2017.

LOUIS – A 19-year-old Iranian woman banned from competing in the name of her country after attending an international competition without an Islamic headscarf has taken her game to St. Louis University. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Dorsa Derakhshani is now at a freshman at the Missouri school, which has a new but highly ranked chess team of top international players. The biology major decided to accept a full scholarship to play for the university this spring, in the wake of the controversy.Issues arose when Derakhshani wore a simple headband during a February competition in Gibraltar. She was competing under the oversight of the Iranian Chess Federation, an affiliation that allowed her to enter several championship-cycle tournaments. Iranian law requires women to wear head scarves in public, but she didn\'t think it would be a problem."I don\'t know why some people have enough free time to worry about what I wear," Derakhshani said.She was 18 when she moved to Barcelona, Spain, and recruited by a chess club. She declined to be on Iran\'s national team sponsored by the government because she didn\'t want to be controlled by the rules of the team, including wearing a head scarf even while outside Iran.But days after the Gibraltar tournament, the head of the Iranian Chess Federation said Derakhshani and her 14-year-old brother could no longer play in the country or under Iran\'s name. He cited Derakhshani\'s refusal to wear a head scarf and said her brother had played against an Israeli player. Iran doesn\'t recognize Israel and has a policy of not competing against Israeli athletes.Derakhshani said her brother was paired by a computer and didn\'t know the player\'s nationality before the match."It was just cruel," she said. "He was just a kid. He didn\'t know what to do."Her arrival in St. Louis comes as the city becomes a major player in the chess community. The Chess Club and Scholastic Center of St. Louis, founded by Republican millionaire activist Rex Sinquefield, hosts several national competitions.Derakhshani said she wants to become a grandmaster, the top designation for a chess player.', 'Jewish Philanthropists Create a Prize for Christian Missionaries - The New York TimesChristian missionary hospitals in Africa, which provide much of the continent’s medical care but are often desperately short of both cash and doctors, are now competing for a major award: a $500,000 prize created specifically for them by a Jewish businessman-philanthropist and his wife, a rabbi.The L’Chaim Prize for Outstanding Christian Medical Missionary Service was founded last year by Mark and Erica Gerson.L’chaim is typically translated as “to life.” But it “really means ‘to lives’ — it’s plural,” argued Mr. Gerson. “There’s no such thing as a Jewish life lived alone.”“The Torah tells us 36 times to ‘love the stranger,’” he added, “and who is more of a stranger than the African poor? These moral superheroes sacrifice everything to serve them.”Last year’s initial award went to Dr. Jason Fader, a surgeon at Kibuye Hope Hospital in rural Burundi. Dr. Fader, an American, is one of only 14 surgeons in Burundi and the only one based outside the capital, Bujumbura.The tiny country is one of the world’s poorest and suffers from the same ethnic divisions and political violence that led to the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda.The money, according to the African Mission Healthcare Foundation, which oversees the award, is paying for a new surgical building and refurbished laboratory, where local medical students will be trained in surgery, and also for operations and prosthetics to help 350 people walk again.This year’s prize will go to Dr. Russell E. White, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Tenwek Hospital in western Kenya.Thousands of Kenyans have heart valves scarred by rheumatic heart disease, which hardly exists in wealthy countries with ready access to antibiotics but is common in poor nations. The valve damage, which can be debilitating or fatal, typically emerges years after a child’s routine strep throat has gone untreated.The money will be used to train cardiac surgeons to repair valves and to treat esophageal cancer and complications of tuberculosis, as well as other common local ailments. It will also pay for ultrasound screening in schools and for antibiotics for students whose strep infections have not yet damaged their hearts.Mr. Gerson began raising money in 2002 when a college friend, Dr. Jon Fielder, worked in a missionary hospital in Kenya and described an overwhelming dilemma: “Faith-based” institutions provide 20 to 50 percent of all medical care in Africa — estimates vary — but the American and European congregations that once supported mission hospitals have shrunk.The doctors who staff these facilities struggle to buy modern equipment, but every day they spend away raising money means dozens of patients go unseen.With the money he makes through the Gerson Lehrman Group, which pairs experts and investors seeking advice, Mr. Gerson also supports United Hatzalah in Israel, a network of 3,500 motorcyle-riding volunteer paramedics who whip through traffic faster than ambulances can.The new award, he hopes, “will galvanize attention around what these superheroes do.”', 'The Mugabe Pick Shouldn’t Hurt the World Health Organization - The New York TimesIt is astonishing that Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, picked Robert Mugabe as a “good-will ambassador.” After the inevitable outcry that followed, Dr. Tedros rescinded the nomination, but the question endures: Could the director general of a major United Nations agency, an Ethiopian who has held a variety of high-level posts in his country and abroad and is well respected in the field of public health, not have read reports on the damage the tyrant of Zimbabwe has done to his own country’s health system?The position of United Nations good-will ambassador is not a salaried one, but appointments to the post are a way to enlist prominent personalities in support of various U.N. programs. Michael Bloomberg, for example, is a global ambassador for noncommunicable diseases.Still, the incident is certain to add to the chorus of criticism from some conservative quarters of the United States that has accompanied the United Nations since its founding, especially coming on the heels of the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco). Much of that has focused on the perception that the United Nations is controlled by a majority that is inimical to American interests and values and obsessed with trashing Israel, and more broadly on the notion that the United States should stay away from all multilateral organizations.That attitude, which is sadly prevalent in President Trump’s view of the world, is particularly unwarranted for the W.H.O., whose global health mission is one the United States should support, especially in preventing the spread of global threats like Ebola. The W.H.O. did come under criticism for its tardiness in recognizing the danger of that outbreak, but not on political or ideological grounds.The real question, however, is not whether multinational forums take actions that are often infuriating — they do — but whether the way to combat this is to pull out.', '                                    The fossilized remains of two teeth that were discovered last year could lead to a rewriting of human history.

It actually looks like a new excellent tooth; however, it’s no longer white. It’s shining like amber,” Herbert Lutz, head of the excavation team and deputy museum director at the Mainz Natural History Museum, told USA Today.Lutz said that the discovery is groundbreaking for its potential to alter our understanding of how humans developed and migrated in prehistoric times.“I don’t want to over-dramatize it, but I would hypothesize that we shall have to start rewriting the history of mankind after today,” Mainz MayorMichael Ebling told reporters during a press conference this week announcing the discovery, reports the Times of Israel.THE FASCINATING SEX LIFE OF JONATHAN, THE 186-YEAR-OLD TORTOISEAccording to researchers, our current understanding is that hominins, our extinct human ancestors, left Africa about 120,000 years ago. The discovered remains are significantly older.“We have comparable finds only in East Africa…but they are only 2, 3, 4 or 5 million years old, and Eppelsheim is almost 10,” said Matz. “So the question is: What has happened? We don’t know where this great ape came from. We do not have comparable finds from southern Europe.”Although the scientist made the discovery in September 2016, they were so confused by what they’d found they waited until this month to release a report about it.As of now, it is not known where the teeth fit in humankind’s family tree. However, Lutz and his team of researchers are only just beginning to fully examine their unique find.“It’s a complete mystery where this individual came from, and why nobody’s ever found a tooth like this somewhere before,"Lutz said in an interview with ResearchGate, where the report was published.', 'Mrs. May’s Tribulations - The New York TimesThese are not easy times for Theresa May. The Brexit negotiations are at a crucial point where the British prime minister needs to be tough, but hardly a day goes by without new revelations of sleaze or ministers’ doing their own thing. The defense secretary quit after allegations of sexual misconduct, and Mrs. May’s most trusted lieutenant may follow; another minister quit after unauthorized meetings in Israel; the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was lambasted after making a statement that could mean more prison time for a Briton imprisoned in Iran.Even in normal times the scandals would have rocked the government, but the brutally complex and consequential task of extricating Britain from the European Union, prompted by an ill-conceived referendum almost 17 months ago, has all but paralyzed the government already. Mrs. May is compelled to keep both “Remainers” and “Leavers” in her cabinet and so has only a limited ability to crack the whip over her ministers.Meanwhile the European Union has warned that unless there is an agreement within two weeks on how much Britain will pay to clear its commitments on leaving the bloc, there will not be enough time to work on trade matters to have a draft ready for a union summit meeting in December. At the same time, Mrs. May faces stiff battles in her Parliament this week over a key bill transferring European Union laws to Britain. The uncertainty has spooked business leaders from both sides of the English Channel.The political mess in Mrs. May’s government, compounded by her failed gamble on a snap election in June, has made the going far tougher and the uncertainties far greater. At this juncture, these must include the possibility of a new government.If there is an upside, it is that what’s happening in Britain is at its core a democratic debate — furious, bitter and divisive, to be sure — over the fundamental conflict of national identity and supranational organizations in a confusing and rapidly changing world. That same debate is shaking up politics across Western democracies, not least the United States. Nobody knows how it will end, but it is democracy, and there is no reason yet to fear that the center cannot hold.', 'John Huddy reportsThe Trump administration has quietly reversed its decision to close the PLO office in Washington over a courts issue, amid concerns the move would jeopardize President Trump’s larger, ambitious effort to achieve Middle East peace.Last week, U.S. officials said the Palestine Liberation Organization mission in the nation’s capital must close, in accordance with a U.S. law related to the Palestinians having tried to get the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israelis.Then officials abruptly reversed course late Friday, as many Americans were enjoying a long Thanksgiving Day weekend.State Department spokesman Edgar Vasquez said the U.S. had instead "advised the PLO Office to limit its activities to those related to achieving a lasting, comprehensive peace between the Israelis and Palestinians."He also said the restrictions will be lifted after 90 days if the U.S. determines the Israelis and Palestinians are engaged in serious peace talks.After U.S. officials announced plans last week to close the mission, the Palestinians said the Trump administration was using “extortion” tactics, in an apparent attempt to force peace talks with Israel.Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki told Palestine Radio that his people won\'t cave to "extortion" and that they await further communication from the administration.“The ball is now in the American court," he said.And Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat called the administration\'s decision "very unfortunate and unacceptable."Erekat also accused the administration of bowing to pressure from the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And he said the Palestinians are "trying to cooperate to achieve the ultimate deal."A State Department official said at the time that the administration is not severing relations with the PLO or the Palestinian Authority and that the closing of the mission should not be interpreted as the administration backing away from trying to reach a peace agreement.Netanyahu\'s office said at the time that the closure was a "matter of U.S. law."Trump has made brokering a long-sought Middle East peace a top priority, with senior White House adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner taking the lead.The president has also sought to strengthen relations with Netanyahu, with whom former President Barack Obama had a weak relationship.Still, Trump has also apparently tried to improve ties with Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the PLO and the Palestinian National Authority.The president talked to Abbas in September at a United Nation’s meeting in New York.Abbas reportedly in September called for ICC to investigate and prosecute Israelis.The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'An Iranian Wrestler Throws His Match to Avoid an Israeli - The New York TimesTEHRAN — The Iranian wrestler was cruising through the match, looking like a sure bet to defeat his Russian opponent. But suddenly, as if suffering an injury, he fell to the mat and was thrown around the ring like a rag doll by the surprised Russian. Finally, the match ended and the referee pronounced the Russian the winner.But the Iranian wrestler was not injured. As Iranian news outlets reported on Tuesday, he said his real problem was that his coach had told him to throw the match to avoid facing an Israeli opponent in the next round of the tournament.In Iran’s hard-line ideology, Israel is not recognized as a state, and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, often refers to the country as “a cancerous tumor.” Iranian athletes are forbidden to compete with Israelis in any sport, and, if necessary, are told to forfeit their matches or to feign sickness.The wrestler, Alireza Karimi-Machiani, 23, can be seen in blue in the video below, taking on Alikhan Zhabrailov, a Russian, on Saturday at the U23 World Senior Wrestling Championship in Poland. (Begin video at 5:50.)Mr. Karimi-Machiani is easily defeating his opponent but after a couple of minutes his coach shouts, “Alireza, lose.” The Iranian wrestler shakes his head and continues, until his coach once again shouts at him. At that point, he throws in the towel, metaphorically speaking, and not for the first time — he did the same thing in 2013.“I was told that the Israeli wrestler defeated his American rival, and that I must lose to avoid facing an Israeli opponent,” Mr. Karimi-Machiani said in an interview with the Iranian Students News Agency. “I have trained hard for months to win a gold medal, and it was easy for me to win.”“I do accept that Israel is an oppressor and commits crimes,” the wrestler said. “But would it not be oppression if our authorities undermine my hard work again?”The day after the match, he posted a video on Instagram of him walking along rainy streets in Poland, listening to a depressing song that starts with the sentence, “Silence is the last stronghold; you cannot take away our right.”“I don’t know what to say to calm you,” an Instagram user, Saeed Parvazi, wrote in the comments. “Politics is separated from sports, damn those who break the hearts of our athletes and people with such policies.”The video stirred up a storm, so on Monday Iran’s Wrestling Federation published a statement praising Mr. Karimi-Machiani’s decision to lose. The statement called him a “hero” who “sacrificed his rights to support the oppressed people of Palestine for the second time.”On Twitter, an Iranian Shiite Muslim cleric, Javad Jalali,  defended the decision, saying that “we will not step onto the mat against Israel until the army of Islam triumphantly steps onto the Holy Land of Palestine.”In August, two Iranian soccer players, stars of the national team then on the roster of a Greek club, Panionios, were suspended for playing a game against an Israeli club, Maccabi Tel Aviv. One of the players, Masoud Shojaei, the national team’s captain, was dishonorably discharged, and the other, Ehsan Haji Safi, was allowed to continue to play for the national team after posting an apology on Instagram.“The dear people of our country have rightly been offended by an event that should not have happened,” he wrote.', '‘I Am Alive’: Survivors of Iran Earthquake Mourn as Government Scrambles to Help - The New York TimesKUIK-E HASAN, Iran — In Kuik-e Hasan, a village of 800 people in the foothills of the Zagros mountains, Moadel Yari, 35, stood biting his lip as he recited the names of his lost relatives: “Amin, Hajar, Toba, Hajin, Abdellah, Boshra, Ozve, Somron.”Iranians living near the border with Iraq are accustomed to earthquakes. They live in a region traversed by fault lines, and the destruction that comes when the ground shakes is not something new. And still, no one in this region was ready for the heavy destruction and loss of life that occurred when the ground shook on Sunday night.There are more than 530 dead, a huge loss in itself, but coming to terms with so much death — and the damage to so many structures, in a region of small villages and towns, all at the same time — was that much harder. This earthquake in northwestern Iran was deadlier than the one that devastated Mexico City in September. Tremors were felt as far away as Turkey, Israel, Lebanon and Pakistan.A lone Shiite cleric, wearing a backpack, sandals and his traditional turban, wandered through the flattened village of Kuik-e Hasan on Tuesday. The cleric, Asgar Zarei, had come from the holy city of Qum with other volunteers to help out, but found himself lost in the destruction. “I’m trying to talk to people about God, give them peace of mind — that is all I can do,” he said. “And pray. One can always pray.”For the Iranian government, which is in a constant struggle to demonstrate that it can, and will, care for its citizens at times of crisis, the earthquake was a test of resources and capabilities. Citizens around Iran watched riveting news feeds on television and social media as survivors used backhoes and their hands to dig through debris in the search for survivors. But for the people in this region the struggle was more elemental — many are living in tents, huddled against the biting cold.The government knew it was being watched. The country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the quake “a divine test for officials and Iranians,” one that will determine “if they can carry out their duties.” President Hassan Rouhani visited the region and stopped in the worst-hit city, Sarpol-e Zahab, promising more help and low-interest loans to developers to rebuild collapsed apartment complexes.The president called the disaster “painful for all Iranians.”After receiving permission from the government to visit the disaster zone, I flew about 265 miles west from Tehran to the regional airport, in the city of Kermanshah. It was then a two-hour drive with an Iranian photographer, Arash Khamooshi, through rugged mountains to the city of Sarpol-e Zahab and the villages surrounding it.After two checkpoints, one manned by police officers in riot gear — protection against bandits, the government said — we hit the main road. It was the only clear path through a town largely in ruins.On the left, a truck blocked the entrance to a shop, cracked open like an eggshell. On the right was a series of apartment buildings; its balconies had fallen off. A mix of locals in busted-up cars, some with their windows broken from rubble, drove up and down. Soldiers from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in pickup trucks, and people bringing water, blankets and orange-flavored cakes from other cities, were also driving in.“I came for a funeral,” said Kamran Moradi, from nearby Qasr-e Shirin, the last city before the border with Iraq. “I have never seen anything like this,” he said.This is a region that is accustomed to tragedy. Its people have tasted the worst life can throw at them, many having survived eight years of war with neighboring Iraq. But they trusted. They thought they could rely on home always being there.“I have seen everything,” said Mohammad Nazari, a veteran of the 1980-88 war.He said he was slow to grasp the significance of the tremors on Sunday night in his hometown, the village of Zarrin Jub.Just after 9 p.m., Mr. Nazari had been focused on his favorite television show. The first tremor felt oddly familiar, he said, but not all that menacing: Jackie, a black guard dog, had already been barking for an hour. He thought the tremor his dog had noticed was one of the small jolts people regularly experience in earthquake-prone Iran.He went back inside to watch TV.Not long after, the walls started shaking. He ran for the hallway, slamming into the walls. Sakine, his wife, ran behind him. “In those seconds you only think of yourself, of surviving,” Mr. Nazari said.In the chaotic minutes following the quake, he was first overwhelmed with joy. “I am alive,” he recalled thinking over and over again. “Alive.”Around the country, people began to rally, to gather goods to distribute to those in need. While the government said it did not need outside assistance, Iranians pulled together. In Tehran, volunteers started online campaigns to gather food and blankets for the victims of the earthquake. “We want to make sure these people get the help they need,” said Pouria Gorji, a factory manager who supports Mr. Rouhani. “Our group is bringing 1,500 tents and 3,000 blankets. The government is overwhelmed.”“Let’s be honest, we don’t have proper crisis management, but we always send a lot of people to help,” said Nader Karimi Joni, a journalist. “We should start preparing for better ways to deal with such terrible events.”An official of the Red Cresent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Sarpol-e Zahab said that 10,000 family-size tents had been brought in, but that distributing them had turned into a scrimmage. Iranians without tents or any other form of shelter accused low-level officials and looters of hoarding tents with plans to sell them later for a profit.Mr. Nazari and several neighbors complained about their representative in Parliament, Farhad Tajari, who grew up in a village nearby. “Where is he?” Mr. Nazari asked. “Why is he not here? We voted for him and need him now.”Some were already preparing for the night. They had parked their cars on a flat space of land. “We sleep in our cars, the remains of our houses are too dangerous and instable with all the aftershocks,” Mr. Nazari said.In Kuik-e Hasan, where Mr. Yari recited the names of his loved ones, relatives arrived from Tehran with a car full of blankets and food. His grandmother sat on a carpet in front of what had been her house, surrounded by cans and plastic bottles. “We still haven’t gotten a tent,” Mr. Yari said.Others in his village were also frustrated, hoping the government would move faster.“They can start with tents,” said Shahram Moradi, a 35-year-old shoe repairman.Down the road a group of women sat on a carpet. They had neatly stacked up the bottles of water people had brought them, but feared the coming night. “Our 10-year-old boy Arman is still here under the rubble,” an older woman said, through her grief. “Tonight, we will sleep next to him.”In Zarrin Jub, mourners sat in rows of yellow and green plastic chairs laid out in a field of wheat stalks. Several of them cried, not just for the man whose life they were commemorating, but from the loss of their homes, their neighbors, their village.“He was a great and selfless guy,” said Zahra Eskandari, reflecting on her cousin, Cyrus Piri, who had been buried soon after his body was recovered from the rubble of his home. “He helped people whenever he could.”Before the quake, Mr. Piri was the man called on to help bury the dead. He would show up at his neighbors’ funerals to sing for free, using his rich bass voice to extol the virtues of revered Shiite figures.There was no one to sing at his funeral.', 'A bombshell CIA document has been released and reveals the intelligence agency investigated up through 1955 the possibility that Hitler survived and escaped to South America.A newly declassified CIA document reveals that the intelligence agency investigated the possibility that Adolf Hitler was alive in South America as late as 1955 — nearly a decade after World War II ended. (Credit: Central Intelligence Agency)The document, which appears on theCIA\'s website, highlights a former SS soldier who told spies he had regularly met with Hilter in Colombia. "CITROEN [a CIA source] claimed to have contacted HITLER about once a month in Colombia on his trip from Maracaibo to that country as/an employee of the KNSM (Royal Dutch) Shipping Co. in Maracaibo," the document reads.It goes on to say that the CIA source indicated to CI MELODY-3’s [CIA informant] he had taken a picture with Hitler, but "did not show the photograph."HITLER MAY HAVE COME CLOSE TO BUILDING AN ATOMIC BOMB, GERMAN TREASURE HUNTER FINDS(Credit: Central Intelligence Agency)The document, three pages in length, suggests that Hitler may have worked as a shipping company employee, prior to potentially fleeing to Argentina. On the second page is a picture of the informant, Phillip Citroen, with a person he claims is Hitler in the mid-1950s.“CIMELODY-3’s friend states that during the later part of September 1955, a Phillip Citroen, former German SS trooper, stated to him confidentially that Adolph Hitler (sic) is still alive," the documents state.(Credit: Central Intelligence Agency)Hitler committed suicide by taking a cyanide capsule and shooting himself. His wife Eva Braun killed herself by swallowing a cyanide pill. His body was later discovered by Soviet soldiers and buried in an unmarked spot. A German court declared Hitler dead, but not until 1956, more than a decade after the war ended.Despite the findings of the German court, rumors have abounded for years that Hitler survived and fled to South America. The discovery of Holocaust planner Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele — the doctor who carried out sick experiments on Auschwitz inmates — in Argentina and Brazil respectively has only added fuel to the rumors, according to a report innews.com.au, which is part of 21st Century Fox.Eichmann was eventually captured and hanged by Israel for his crimes in 1961, but Mengele managed to avoid capture. He ultimately died, having drowned while swimming off the coast of Brazil in 1979.JFK\'S DIARY REVEALS FASCINATION WITH HITLER, COMPARED TO \'LEGEND\'The file was put together by CIA Caracas bureau chief David Brixnor and wired to Washington in 1955, alongside the aforementioned picture of Citroen and the person who was allegedly Hitler.Follow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter@Chris_Ciaccia', 'The Self-Destruction of American Democracy - The New York TimesPresident Trump has single-handedly done more to undermine the basic tenets of American democracy than any foreign agent or foreign propaganda campaign could.“Trump is a political weapon of mass self-destruction for American democracy — for its norms, for its morality, for sheer human decency,” Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at Brookings, wrote by email:For the moment, let’s put aside the conclusion of “Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections,” the F.B.I., C.I.A. and N.S.A. joint report that was released in January, which said that:This determination, disputed by Trump and others, pales in comparison to the ruinous record of Trump’s 10 months in office.First and foremost, Trump has gravely damaged the premises and procedures that undergird American democracy.Partisan polarization, which helped give rise to Trump in the first place, is getting worse as discord intensifies with every slur and insult Trump hurls.On Oct. 5, the Pew Research Center reported that partisan conflict on fundamental political valuesIn the introduction to their forthcoming book, “How Democracies Die,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, political scientists at Harvard, write:Their attempt at reassurance is not comforting:In an email, Levitsky argued that “it is important that we understand that the U.S. has largely been doing these things to itself,” before adding, “obviously we should investigate Russian meddling to the fullest, but to blame Putin for the mess we are in today would be ridiculous. We Americans created this mess.”Along similar lines, Ryan Enos, who is also a political scientist at Harvard, suggested that the question of Russian involvement in the election is a secondary issue:In addition, Enos noted,Trump has not only taken a hammer to the code of behavior underpinning democracy at home, he has simultaneously diminished the international stature of the United States — and arguably accelerated the rise of this country’s major competitor, China.Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T. and a co-author of “Why Nations Fail,” argued in an email that he believesTrump’s chaotic approach to foreign affairs has, in turn, served to strengthen both Russia and China, in the view of several experts.Arthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, emailed:The net result?“We now have reduced leverage in many international settings.”A Pew survey of adults in 37 foreign nations released in June provides the clearest evidence of Trump’s effect on America’s international stature. It found thatAs the accompanying chart shows, confidence in Obama was higher than confidence in Trump in 35 countries. Tellingly, Trump did better than Obama in only two, Russia and Israel.Critics of Trump’s foreign policy contend that the drive by Rex W. Tillerson, Trump’s Secretary of State, to “streamline” the department by forcing out as many as 2,000 State Department employees has had the effect of diminishing America’s international presence. By the end of this month, the number in the two top ranks — career ambassadors and career ministers — is scheduled to be cut in half, from 39 to 19.In a Nov. 15 letter to Tillerson, Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on State Department and USAID Management, wrote:Their verdict:Trump’s assault — and that of his appointees — on democratic standards and principles is the central element of what might be called a brutalizing or “decivilizational” process. That’s part of what underlies the eternal return of the president’s mendacity, reappearing this month in his behind-the-scenes recitation of lies about Obama’s birthplace and the Access Hollywood tape on which he can be heard bragging about what you can do to women “when you’re a star.”These developments have revived open discussion of Trump’s mental health.There are “signs that Trump is sometimes incapable of discerning real life from fiction,” David A. Graham wrote in The Atlantic on Nov. 27.On Wednesday, Trump pushed the envelope even further, retweeting videos from an ultranationalist group in Britain “purportedly showing Muslims committing acts of violence.” Prime Minister Theresa May explicitly faulted Trump, saying “It is wrong for the president to have done this.” As The Times reported, “No modern American president has promoted inflammatory content of this sort from an extremist organization.”Trump’s extraordinary record of prevarication calls the truth into question. As Hannah Arendt famously put it, when this happens, nothing can be believed anymore:Or as Arendt told a French interviewer in 1974:Add to Trump’s list of lies his race baiting, his attacks on a free press, his charges of “fake news,” his efforts to instigate new levels of voter suppression, his undermining of the legitimacy of the electoral process, his disregard for the independence of the judiciary, the hypocrisy of his personal posture on sexual harassment, the patent lack of concern for delivering results to voters who supported him, his contempt for and manipulation of his own loyalists, his “failure of character” — and you have a lethal corruption of democratic leadership.On Nov. 15, Acemoglu wrote in Foreign Policy:Acemoglu then asked, “Is it time to rejoice in the strength of American institutions?” Short answer: no.In the face of these threats, Acemoglu continues, “the performance of U.S. checks and balances so far gives no comfort.”The test facing our democracy now is whether the rules of engagement that make the system work can be restored. Trump trampled on those rules and won the presidency. That precedent may, in and of itself, have inflicted irreparable damage.Is there a legal remedy? From the Mueller investigation, for example?“Executive authoritarianism and lawlessness can be hemmed in and checked but not fully constrained by courts, the criminal law, or the written Constitution,” Jacob T. Levy wrote this week in “The Limits of Legalism,” published by the libertarian-leaning Niskanen Center:At the moment, Trump’s co-partisans, House and Senate Republicans, have shown little willingness to confront him. The longer Trump stays in office, the greater the danger that he will inflict permanent damage on the institutions that must be essential tools in any serious attempt to confront him.', 'A New African Tradition for Hanukkah - The New York TimesFor Meskerem Gebreyohannes, all of the Jewish holidays bring doro wat, a luxurious chicken dish she makes with slowly cooked onions and a red chile sauce layered with flavors from the African spice trail.Despite growing up in a Jewish family in Harar, a city in Ethiopia a few hours by car from Somalia, she never celebrated “modern” holidays like Hanukkah.Mrs. Gebreyohannes, 58, is the chef and an owner, with her husband, Kassa, of Taste of Ethiopia, a small restaurant in Southfield, Mich. She is like many other Jewish immigrants from Ethiopia, who did not learn the story of the Maccabees defeating the Greeks. It appears in the oral Torah that was written down around A.D. 200, a time when much of the world was unaware of the existence of a Jewish community in Ethiopia.Separated from Israel and the Diaspora for more than 2,000 years, Ethiopian Jews followed the Old Testament, which does not include the Hanukkah story, as a source for holiday customs. Mrs. Gebreyohannes fled Ethiopia in 1981 as a refugee to Djibouti, then went to Canada in 1982, where she started observing the custom of lighting a menorah for eight days. She settled in Michigan in 2004.Now, her Hanukkah traditions include candle lighting with tofe (a homemade Ethiopian beeswax candle with a big flame) as well as the doro wat, “chicken with sauce” in Amharic, a dish eaten by all Ethiopians. For her celebrations, Mrs. Gebreyohannes serves it with dabo, a holiday bread made with flour, or injera, the daily bread made of teff.“In Ethiopia, we were always surrounded by cooking,” she said earlier this fall, while pulverizing the onions and garlic for her doro wat.Ms. Gebreyohannes uses oil rather than the more traditional ghee used in the dish. Bright red berbere — she uses a chile spice mix from Ethiopia that includes cardamom, ginger, fenugreek and thyme — lends more than color to the sauce.“When you smell a good berbere, you can taste the spices are there, and you don’t need to add anything else,” she said. “The spices act like cornstarch or flour to give the sauce substance.”Mrs. Gebreyohannes learned in Ethiopia to use every part of the chicken: the bones for soups and the skin to enrich the sauces. She nostalgically refers to the birds from her home as “sacred.”“We say that when a woman knows how to pull apart the 12 parts of a whole chicken, she has become a full woman and is ready to marry,” she said. (For the record, that’s a pair each of drumsticks, thighs, breasts and wings, and the chest, neck, ribs and giblets.) “As a child, I learned to prepare meals and dishes for many people. The idea of making a meal for less than 10 people is American.”Her doro wat recipe may not last for all eight nights of Hanukkah. But it will add warmth, and a new holiday tradition, for one.Recipe: Doro Wat (Ethiopian-Style Spicy Chicken)Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

Because of those issues, the embassy is not likely to move for at least 3 or 4 years, presuming there is no future change in U.S. policy.The U.S. officials spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity Tuesday because they were not authorized to publicly preview Trump\'s announcement.', '', 'Cineworld and Regal in Blockbuster Merger to Challenge AMC - The New York TimesLONDON — The two largest movie theater chains in the United States will soon be owned by foreign companies.The British movie theater owner Cineworld said on Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire Regal Entertainment Group, one of the biggest cinema operators in the United States, for $3.6 billion.The deal would greatly expand the scale and geographic footprint of Cineworld, which primarily operates in Europe, and create the world’s second-largest movie theater owner to better compete with AMC Entertainment, which is owned by the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda. The Cineworld-Regal combination would create a company with more than 9,500 screens in 10 countries.It comes at a time of flux for operators of movie theaters competing in an increasingly saturated marketplace. At the same time, studios, such as the Walt Disney Company, are exerting more control over when and how their biggest films are shown, putting pressure on operators.And despite higher average ticket prices, box office revenue is down in the United States this year after a dismal summer. The few standouts were the superhero flicks “Wonder Woman,” “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” and “Spider-Man: Homecoming.” The latest adaptation of Stephen King’s “It” was also a bright spot this autumn, but “Justice League,” which brought together some of DC Comics’ biggest heroes, opened to disappointing results in North America last month.Ticket sales are likely to be bolstered by the release of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” this month.“Regal is a great business and provides Cineworld with the optimal platform on which we can continue our growth strategy,” Mooky Greidinger, the Cineworld chief executive, said in a news release. “Consolidation is an important move forward, and the best practice we have successfully rolled out across Europe will be the key driver to continued success.”The transaction was announced a week after the companies confirmed they were in advanced discussions to merge. Under the terms of the deal, Cineworld would pay $23 a share in cash for Regal. Shares of Regal closed on Monday at $20.73 a share.Regal is the second-biggest cinema operator in the United States, behind AMC, with 7,315 screens at 561 cinemas. Regal is controlled by the billionaire Philip F. Anschutz’s Anschutz Corporation, which has agreed to support the deal. Cineworld, which was founded in 1995 in Britain, is the second-largest movie theater chain in Europe, after AMC, with 2,227 screens at 232 sites in Europe and Israel. It reported revenue of 798 million pounds, or about $1.1 billion, in its 2016 financial year.Regal’s theater brands include Regal Cinemas, United Artists and Hollywood Theaters. It reported revenue of $3.2 billion in the 2016 fiscal year.Amy Miles, the Regal chief executive, said the offer represented “a meaningful premium on Regal’s unaffected share price” and provided “compelling value for our stockholders.”The deal would be structured as a so-called reverse merger, requiring the approval of Cineworld’s shareholders. It is expected to be completed in the first quarter of next year.The transaction will be financed through a combination of debt and the sale of about £1.7 billion in equity. The Greidinger family, Cineworld’s largest shareholder, has agreed to fully subscribe to the fund-raising.Barclays, HSBC and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flomadvised Cineworld, while Morgan Stanley and the law firms WilmerHale and Macfarlanes advised Regal.', 'Legal expert says Flynn is now a \'worthless witness.\'Editor\'s note: this originally appeared in The Hill.The charge to which retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has pleaded guilty may tell us a great deal about the Robert Mueller investigation.The first question is, why did Flynn lie? People who lie to the FBI generally do so because, if they told the truth, they would be admitting to a crime. But the two conversations that Flynn falsely denied having were not criminal. He may have believed they were criminal but, if he did, he was wrong.Consider his request to Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., to delay or oppose a United Nations Security Council vote on an anti-Israel resolution that the outgoing Obama administration refused to veto. Not only was that request not criminal, it was the right thing to do. President Obama\'s unilateral decision to change decades-long American policy by not vetoing a perniciously one-sided anti-Israel resolution was opposed by Congress and by most Americans. It was not good for America, for Israel or for peace. It was done out of Obama\'s personal pique against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rather than on principle.Despite the banner headlines calling the Flynn guilty plea a "thunderclap," I think it may be a show of weakness on the part of the special counsel rather than a sign of strength.Many Americans of both parties, including me, urged the lame-duck Obama not to tie the hands of the president-elect by allowing the passage of a resolution that would make it more difficult to achieve a negotiated peace in the Middle East.As the president-elect, Donald Trump was constitutionally and politically entitled to try to protect his ability to broker a fair peace between the Israelis and Palestinians by urging all members of the Security Council to vote against or delay the enactment of the resolution. The fact that such efforts to do the right thing did not succeed does not diminish the correctness of the effort. I wish it had succeeded. We would be in a better place today.Some left-wing pundits, who know better, are trotting out the Logan Act, which, if it were the law, would prohibit private citizens (including presidents-elect) from negotiating with foreign governments. But this anachronistic law hasn\'t been used for more than 200 years. Under the principle of desuetude - a legal doctrine that prohibits the selective resurrection of a statute that has not been used for many decades - it is dead-letter. Moreover, the Logan Act is unconstitutional insofar as it prohibits the exercise of free speech.If it were good law, former Presidents Reagan and Carter would have been prosecuted: Reagan for negotiating with Iran\'s ayatollahs when he was president-elect, to delay releasing the American hostages until he was sworn in; Carter for advising Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to reject former President Clinton\'s peace offer in 2000-2001. Moreover, Jesse Jackson, Jane Fonda, Dennis Rodman and others who have negotiated with North Korea and other rogue regimes would have gone to prison.So there was nothing criminal about Flynn\'s request of Kislyak, even if he were instructed to do so by higher-ups in the Trump transition team. The same is true of his discussions regarding sanctions. The president-elect is entitled to have different policies about sanctions and to have his transition team discuss them with Russian officials.This is the way The New York Times has put it: "Mr. Flynn\'s discussions with Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, were part of a coordinated effort by Mr. Trump\'s aides to create foreign policy before they were in power, documents released as part of Mr. Flynn\'s plea agreement show. Their efforts undermined the existing policy of President Barack Obama and flouted a warning from a senior Obama administration official to stop meddling in foreign affairs before the inauguration."If that characterization is accurate, it demonstrates conclusively that the Flynn conversations were political and not criminal. Flouting a warning from the Obama administration to stop meddling may be a political sin (though some would call it a political virtue) but it most assuredly is not a crime.So why did Flynn lie about these conversations, and were his lies even material to Mueller\'s criminal investigation if they were not about crimes?The second question is why did Mueller charge Flynn only with lying? The last thing a prosecutor ever wants to do is to charge a key witness with lying.A witness such as Flynn who has admitted he lied - whether or not to cover up a crime - is a tainted witness who is unlikely to be believed by jurors who know he\'s made a deal to protect himself and his son. They will suspect that he is not only "singing for his supper" but that he may be "composing" as well - that is, telling the prosecutor what he wants to hear, even if it is exaggerated or flat-out false. A "bought" witness knows that the "better" his testimony, the sweeter the deal he will get. That\'s why prosecutors postpone the sentencing until after the witness has testified, because experience has taught them that you can\'t "buy" a witness; you can only "rent” them for as long as you have the sword of Damocles hanging over them.So, despite the banner headlines calling the Flynn guilty plea a "thunderclap," I think it may be a show of weakness on the part of the special counsel rather than a sign of strength. So far he has had to charge potential witnesses with crimes that bear little or no relationship to any possible crimes committed by current White House incumbents. Mueller would have much preferred to indict Flynn for conspiracy or some other crime directly involving other people, but he apparently lacks the evidence to do so.I do not believe he will indict anyone under the Logan Act. If he were to do so, that would be unethical and irresponsible. Nor do I think he will charge President Trump with any crimes growing out of the president\'s exercise of his constitutional authority to fire the director of the FBI or to ask him not to prosecute Flynn.The investigation will probably not end quickly, but it may end with, not a thunderclap, but several whimpers.Alan M.

Norton & Company. $28.95.Were Jews always funny? For most of their history they had a reputation, at least among their gentile neighbors, for being humorless and glum. But in 1978, Time magazine claimed that 80 percent of all stand-up comedians in the United States were Jewish. So either Jews got funnier, or they were just funny all along and nobody noticed.There are plenty of theories to explain Jewish humor — most devised by Jews. Saul Bellow, channeling his inner Kierkegaard, thought Jewish humor combined “laughter and trembling.” Freud believed Jewish humor was a defense mechanism: a form of sublimated aggression that lets victims of persecution safely cope with their condition. Or as Mel Brooks put it: “If they’re laughing, how can they bludgeon you to death?”In “Jewish Comedy: A Serious History,” the Columbia professor Jeremy Dauber skates through more than 2,000 years of material without ever settling on one overarching theory. Instead, in the manner of a field biologist, he lays out a detailed taxonomy of Jewish humor: seven categories to cover everything from the Book of Esther to “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” with one chapter devoted to each category. There’s a chapter for humor about anti-Semitism; one for satirical humor; one for highbrow wit and wordplay; another for theological or philosophical humor; and a vaguely defined catchall subgenus, the comedy of disguise, that somehow covers all the work of Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, the Marx Brothers and Jerry Seinfeld.Instead of a chronological history, Dauber’s systematic approach samples Jewish history from beginning to end in each chapter, with illustrations from the Bible, 18th-century Yiddish drama and Lena Dunham’s “Girls.” Then he rewinds the tape for the next chapter, and starts again. Seven times. It makes for frustrating and repetitive reading. “The Bible,” as Dauber eventually confesses, “is not funny,” but that doesn’t stop him. Is the Book of Esther amusing enough to warrant seven different exegeses? Funny you should ask. What starts out as a quirky conceit rapidly devolves into an annoying tic. Because of all the circling back, Dauber tries to keep readers oriented with awkward phrases like “as we’ve mentioned earlier,” “we’ve already spoken about,” “we’ve already encountered Rabbi Gamaliel in an earlier chapter,” or this: “Considering Jews and space leads us back to Woody Allen.”Nonetheless, this narrative straitjacket doesn’t keep Dauber, a serious scholar of Yiddish and Hebrew literature, from making original points along the way. There are thoughtful mini-essays on Philip Roth and Kafka, for example. On Kafka, Dauber argues that his subversive comedy is distinctly Jewish because it mocks the pretensions of scientific certainty that papers over the irrational forces controlling our lives. Kafka’s stories convey “the monstrously misunderstood distortions peeking out, in a way so horrible that you just have to laugh.”Dauber’s preferred subject, though, is contemporary Jewish-American film and television comedy. Larry David’s work gets more attention than Kafka or Roth. Unfortunately, most of the commentary on figures like David, Jerry Lewis, Mike Nichols and Judd Apatow is not particularly new or original. He’s better when he sticks to the areas where he holds a scholarly advantage. The fascinating but too-brief sections on 18th- and 19th-century Yiddish drama are startling. Who knew how much German-Jewish comedy was focused on mocking the more pious Jews of Eastern Europe, ridiculing them as foolish, corrupt and sexually perverse country bumpkins. The Jewish minority in Berlin were betting on assimilation and acceptance, trying to distance themselves from their more alien landsmen to the east. Though, in retrospect, who were the bigger fools?This is where the absence of any grand unifying theory feels like a cop-out. Dauber is more comfortable with the triumph of Jewish-American comedy than with the dreary denouement of the European branch. He quotes Freud’s sly observation, “I do not know whether there are many other instances of a people making fun to such a degree of their own character,” but he’s reluctant to dig too deeply into this masochistic strain in Jewish humor. You’ll find more nuance in Ruth Wisse’s  book, “No Joke: Making Jewish Humor,” which covers the same ground, but with a greater willingness to probe the ways in which Jewish humor made too much of a virtue out of weakness and passivity.“What shall I do when laughing is a kind of illness for me?” the great Yiddish humorist Sholom Aleichem asked. He embraced Zionism, partly as a way out of the trap, and certainly the Jewish state is a test for most theories of Jewish humor. What happens when Jews are no longer a persecuted minority? Can a well-armed majority still be funny?Yet there are only a few pages about Israel here, mostly unenthusiastic. No mention of classic bits by Arik Einstein and Uri Zohar, or the political satire of contemporary television shows like “Eretz Nehederet” and “Hayehudim Baim” (check out their take on the Book of Esther on YouTube!). He ignores the recent Israeli hit film “Zero Motivation,” a comedy about bored young women in the Israel Defense Forces (optioned for American adaptation by Amy Poehler), and skips younger authors like Etgar Keret and Assaf Gavron, whose 2014 novel, “The Hilltop,” is a remarkably dark and sardonic portrait of the settler movement.But if Dauber is as worried as he claims to be that as American Jews assimilate, Jewish-American comedy will become less distinctively Jewish and more generically American — something he warns of in his concluding pages — all the more reason for a serious scholar of Jewish comedy to turn east.', 'Rouhani Lashes Back at Trump, as Iran Unveils New Missile - The New York TimesEscalating a war of words with the United States, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran declared on Friday that his country would continue to develop new missiles and “would not seek anyone’s permission to defend our land.”As he spoke at a military parade in Tehran, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps unveiled a ballistic missile with a range of about 1,250 miles, making it capable of reaching much of the Middle East, including Israel.Mr. Rouhani’s nationally televised speech at the parade — which commemorated the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-88 — and the show of force were a direct display of defiance toward President Trump, who signed a bill in August imposing mandatory penalties on those involved in Iran’s ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them.Although United Nations provisions seek to limit ballistic missile technology, the nuclear agreement negotiated in 2015 by Iran and six world powers, including the United States, does not prohibit Iran from developing such weapons.The Trump administration has called the omission of ballistic missiles a central flaw of the agreement, which Mr. Trump may try to revisit — or scrap altogether, as he has threatened in the past.At the annual United Nations gathering in New York this week, Mr. Trump called the nuclear deal “an embarrassment to the United States,” and Mr. Rouhani retorted, in his own address: “It will be a great pity if this agreement were to be destroyed by ‘rogue’ newcomers to the world of politics.”Upon his return from New York, Mr. Rouhani strongly defended Iran’s right to self-defense.“We will increase our military power as a deterrent,” he said. “We will strengthen our missile capabilities. We will not seek anyone’s permission to defend our land. Not only will we fortify our missiles, but our ground, navy and air forces will always be supported by the people.”The unveiling of the new missile, called the Khoramshahr, comes two months after Iran launched a missile into space, prompting a new round of sanctions and criticism from the United States.“Rouhani is playing hardball,” said Sanam Vakil, an Iran scholar at Chatham House, a think tank in London, and at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. “By promising to step up Iran’s ballistic missile program, Rouhani seeks to gain support from Iranian hard-liners who have long been critical of the nuclear deal, and who have repeatedly accused him of being soft in international relations. Moreover, hard-liners, such as Iran’s supreme leader, believe compromise with the United States is a futile exercise.”She added: “History and the experience of other rogue states such as North Korea has also shown the Iranian government that it is only from a position of strength that regimes such as Iran’s can be protected.”In his remarks, Mr. Rouhani said that Iran was ready to “defend the innocent people of Yemen, Syria and Palestine,” and would "strengthen our defensive and military power as much as we deem necessary for deterrence.”The state-run news agency IRNA quoted the chief of the Revolutionary Guards’ airspace division, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, as saying that the new missile “can carry several warheads for various uses.” The agency did not provide further information on the missile.Mr. Rouhani, a moderate, has staked his reputation on sealing the nuclear deal and relieving the Iranian economy of debilitating international sanctions. In a rejoinder to Mr. Trump’s call to renegotiate the nuclear deal, he said that “all countries” at the General Assembly meeting supported the nuclear deal, “except the United States and the Zionist regime,” a reference to Israel.“Like North Korea, Iran is responding to Trump’s bellicosity by its own display of strength, to show it is not cowed,” said Mark Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Americas office of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think tank.He cautioned that Iran’s claim that the new missile could carry multiple warheads “needs to be taken with a grain of salt,” adding that he “may mean nothing more than multiple cluster bombs,” not the kind of ballistic missile payload — multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle, or MIRV — associated with nuclear missiles.Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, has said that the Iran nuclear agreement must be changed or the United States would not stick with it. Iran has said the accord is not up for renegotiation.The possibility that Washington might renege on the deal has worried some countries, especially as the world grapples with North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile development.This week, Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China said that tensions on the Korean Peninsula highlighted the importance of the Iranian deal, and Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia said that the United States’ imposition of unilateral sanctions on Iran was “illegitimate and undermines the collective nature of international efforts.”', 'After the Chase, the Long Goodbye - The New York TimesLosing her husband, Jerome, in March was devastating for Ellen Stern. And preparing to part with much of their extensive art collection this fall is its own kind of grief.“It’s like you’re stripped naked,” Ms. Stern, 71, said in an interview at the Upper West Side apartment she shared for 30 years with Mr. Stern, a venture capitalist who died of congestive heart disease at 93. “It’s a very emotional feeling; it’s a very intense feeling.“I wouldn’t say they’re exactly like children, but you love each of them in their own way,” she added of their artworks. “These are things you shared together and loved, and you just hope each one gets a good home.”The Sterns’ Manhattan apartment is filled with paintings, sculpture and photography, as is the “art barn” on their 16-acre estate in Westhampton, N.Y. Valuable pieces from both locations will come up for sale at Sotheby’s starting in November and continuing through March, including more than 250 lots of Modern, Surrealist, Contemporary and Israeli works, as well as examples of Arts & Crafts furniture.David Smith’s steel sculpture “Voltri Bolton X” (1962), for example, will be featured in the auction house’s contemporary art evening sale in New York on Nov. 16, with an estimate of $6 million to $8 million.Also included in the sales is a work by David Hammons; paintings by Pablo Picasso, Paul Delvaux and Victor Brauner; outdoor furniture by Scott Burton; and light fixtures by Greene & Greene and Tiffany Studios.Ms. Stern met Mr. Stern at an art opening for the sculptor Serge Spitzer, who died in 2012. She asked the collector why he liked the artist’s “smudges on paper.” Mr. Stern responded, “You never get bored with them.” Mr. Spitzer subsequently went on to design the Sterns’ art barn, which is now for sale, along with their Hamptons home, which the family calls “Camp Jerome.”Mr. Stern was a trustee at the New Museum and a patron of the Israel Museum. These are edited excerpts from the conversation with Ms. Stern, who earned her degree in art history and studied archaeology. She also did a stint at Seventeen Magazine when the artist Joseph Cornell worked in the mailroom.What collecting tastes did you and your husband share?Both our backgrounds were sculptural. Even in the photography, there is something sculptural about every piece.What fueled your collecting as a couple?We just had a lot of fun doing it. Jerome loved the chase, meeting the artists, getting to know the artists. Wangechi Mutu was married on our property in Westhampton. We helped support the artists. It’s nice knowing the artists and seeing how their careers develop.Did you always agree on art purchases?Everything was bought together. We would bicker a lot, I have to say, but we generally liked the same kind of art.Why are you selling it?Because of taxes.And why Sotheby’s?We also collected clam rakes, pulleys, hat molds. We wanted somebody who would be able to handle everything.What is it like having your personal possessions appraised for their monetary value?That’s the hard thing; you build a relationship with a piece, and then they tell you it’s not worth very much.Tell me about the works by Lynette Yiadom-Boakye on your wall. We saw her for the first time at the Studio Museum. There was something there, like a Goya. Then she started painting composite black people. In this one, a woman is singing, she’s up in a cloud. I like the mystery about it.You have a long history of collecting Marlene Dumas, and 15 of your works by her will be sold at Sotheby’s, led by “Magdalena,” estimated at $3 million to $4 million. What drew you to her?We saw her work in the first South Africa biennial. We chased her down through galleries in Europe. When she did a series of artworks “Against the Wall,” [17 paintings centered on the Israeli conflict], Jerry would correspond with her about the politics of them.What is it you like about the Picasso painted on a wooden shutter?We always would debate this one because it’s called “The Kiss,” but we think they’re arguing. You have to collect art with a sense of humor.', 'The defense secretary testified it\'s in America\'s interest to remain in the agreement; on \'Special Report\' Jennifer Griffin reports.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis testified Tuesday that the United States should remain in the Iran nuclear deal, as President Trump weighs whether to renew the controversial agreement ahead of an Oct. 15 deadline.The president has been highly critical of the Obama-era pact, as recently as last month calling it one of the "worst deals" he\'s ever seen.But Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford both indicated support for the agreement during a hearing Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee.Mattis was pressed by Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, on whether he thought there was a “national security interest” to remain in the Iran deal. “Yes, sir. I do,” Mattis said.Late last month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson suggested that the president had made his decision on whether to withdraw from the agreement but had not shared that decision “externally.”The president, who has twice re-certified the deal since taking office, has repeatedly slammed the arrangement. He told reporters last month that it\'s not "fair" and should never have been made.But Trump has not said whether he plans to re-certify Iran\'s compliance by the Oct. 15 deadline. Denying certification could lead the U.S. to reintroduce sanctions, which could lead Iran to walk away from the deal or even restart some nuclear activities it had engaged in prior to the 2015 agreement.Dunford testified Tuesday that Iran, however, is following the requirements of the deal.“The agreement right now, what I testified to last week, Iran is not in material breach of the agreement,” Dunford told lawmakers on the panel. “And I do believe the agreement, to date, has delayed the development of nuclear capability by Iran.”Mattis noted that while he believes it is in the best interest of the U.S. to abide by the nuclear deal, the administration is “very alert” to any “cheating” by the Iranians.“The amount of misconduct, I would call it, internationally, whether it be with ballistic missiles, rhetoric, support to terrorists, threats to our friends, Arab and Israel in the region by Iran, are areas that they are open to a great deal, I think, of censure by the international community,” Mattis said. “We are not naive about their agreement on the nuclear issue, and we are being very alert to any cheating on that right now.”Congress requires the president to certify the Iran deal every 90 days under law.“They are two different pieces,” Mattis said, referring to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act and the international agreement. “I’ve been dealing with the president and the secretary of state and it is being considered in terms of security for the U.S.—the law plus the agreement.”Fox News\' Lucas Tomlinson and the Associated Press contributed to this report.Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

And Why Does Trump Hate It? - The New York TimesPresident Trump announced that he would decertify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement reached with six world powers, including the United States.Mr. Trump did not immediately pull out of the accord. He essentially deferred to Congress a decision about whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran, which could destroy the agreement. And he added an ultimatum, declaring that if the agreement were not renegotiated to permanently stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, he would terminate it at some point in the future.Here are some questions and answers about the agreement and the possible consequences. Which countries negotiated the agreement and what did it accomplish?The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — plus Germany, known as the P5-plus-1 group, negotiated the agreement with Iran. Disarmament advocates consider it a major achievement of the Obama administration, averting a possible military conflict with Iran and a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.The agreement severely limited Iran’s ability to enrich uranium fuel and other activities necessary to make nuclear weapons. While Iran has repeatedly promised that it would never seek nuclear weapons, the agreement provided verifiable assurances for the first time.In return, a wide array of economic penalties that had been imposed on Iran were rescinded or suspended, including many American sanctions and a European oil embargo that had weakened the Iranian economy.Why has Mr. Trump called it the “worst deal” and an “embarrassment”?He has argued that the Obama administration focused on Iran’s nuclear program while giving insufficient attention to many other of Iran’s activities, including its support for President Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria, its intervention in the Yemeni civil war and the role of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in disrupting the region.Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the White House said on Friday, the United States had “consistently prioritized the immediate threat of Sunni extremist organizations over the longer-term threat of Iranian-backed militancy.” Like many of his predecessors, Mr. Trump has favored Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Muslim allies in the region over Iran, the world’s dominant Shiite Muslim power.Even on nuclear issues, Mr. Trump says, the deal didn’t go far enough, because it does not permanently stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and because it does not include restrictions on missile testing. He also says that inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations body that oversees compliance with the agreement, have insufficient monitoring powers.And Mr. Trump has criticized the release of billions of dollars in impounded Iranian money, describing it as a giveaway that has reduced American leverage.How have other American politicians responded to Mr. Trump’s complaints?A number of anti-Iran voices agree with Mr. Trump. But while many critics of Iran in the United States, both Democrats and Republicans, agree that the agreement has flaws, they also say it is better than nothing. Others fear the United States will lose international credibility and alienate European allies by renouncing or undermining the deal.They also point out that despite Mr. Trump’s denunciations, the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly found that Iran is complying.All the other parties to the agreement contend that it is working, and some of Mr. Trump’s own advisers counseled him that it was in the interest of national security.Why does Mr. Trump remain so hostile toward the agreement?He pledged during the 2016 election campaign to scrap or renegotiate the agreement, which he said had weakened American security and appeased a longtime enemy of the United States and Israel. Moreover, under an American law, he had to certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran was complying, creating a politically uncomfortable quandary for him four times a year.Mr. Trump’s formal step of decertifying Iran gives lawmakers 60 days to decide whether to reimpose nuclear sanctions — effectively throwing responsibility for the agreement’s fate to Congress.Does that mean decertification kills the deal?No — or at least not necessarily. Iranian officials have suggested that they regard decertification to be an internal American political matter, as long as it does not lead to reimposed sanctions.Would reimposed sanctions kill it?Iranian officials have strongly suggested that they would abandon the agreement, or at least no longer feel bound by its nuclear limitations.At the same time, the Iranian government remains extremely reluctant to take such a step because it could jeopardize the economic relationships it has developed or revived with other parties to the accord, most notably in France and Germany.Preservation of the agreement also keeps alive the prospect that Iran can purchase billions of dollars worth of Boeing and Airbus aircraft it has ordered under a provision of the accord that permitted such transactions.Why can’t the agreement be renegotiated?It may be possible, but Iran’s leaders have ridiculed the idea. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran, who led the Iranian team that reached the deal in 2015, told The New York Times in an interview that the United States wanted to renegotiate only the provisions it disliked. And if the United States withdrew from the agreement, he said, “Who would come and listen to you anymore?”', 'The Worst Time for the Left to Give Up on Free Speech - The New York TimesOn Sept. 27, in an incident that has since ricocheted around conservative media, the Black Lives Matter chapter at the College of William and Mary shut down a talk by the director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia on “Students and the First Amendment.” It’s unfortunate for the students involved that their protest drew national notice; the internet makes it far too easy for undergraduates experimenting with radicalism to become instantly infamous. Yet the attention is unsurprising, because the event, live-streamed by the student activists themselves, seemed to epitomize campus trends that many outsiders abhor.The confrontation began just as the A.C.L.U.’s Claire Gastañaga started talking about “knowing your rights during protests and demonstrations.” A multiracial group of around a dozen black-clad students marched to the front of the auditorium, arrayed themselves before the stage and began chanting things like “A.C.L.U.! You’d protect Hitler too!” They’d been moved to protest because the A.C.L.U. had defended the rights of white supremacists to rally in Charlottesville, Va. At one point they intoned “Shame! Shame! Shame!” in a cadence that recalled a disturbing scene of public humiliation from “Game of Thrones.” Gastañaga was not able to continue speaking.It can be hard to know what to make of reports of a free speech crisis on college campuses. Some progressives claim that concerns about left-wing student authoritarianism are overblown, and occasionally I’m tempted to believe them. A recent survey that purported to show widespread student hostility to free speech became a minor media sensation, only to be debunked by a polling expert who declared its methodology “junk science.” Last month, the professional troll Milo Yiannopoulos tried to bait the left with plans for a so-called Free Speech Week at the University of California, Berkeley, to be packed with talks by figures anathema to the campus left. It seemed meant to make the school look censorious, but it failed. Berkeley bent over backward to accommodate Yiannopoulos, and the event’s organizers ended up canceling.Still, if the average college campus is not quite the Maoist re-education camp of right-wing fantasy, there are enough embarrassing incidents like the one at William and Mary to suggest that parts of the left disdain the First Amendment.At times, I can understand why young radicals might roll their eyes when they hear “free speech.” They’ve grown up at a time when the people proclaiming the phrase the loudest are reactionaries like Yiannopoulos or Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who lectured about campus free speech at Georgetown’s law school last month. College-age leftists also have more reason to fear far-right ideas than my generation did. I grew up admiring the A.C.L.U. for defending the right of neo-Nazis to march through Skokie, Ill., in 1978, but that might be because I never saw neo-Nazis as a genuine threat. Perhaps I’d have been less sanguine if the president of the United States had described the Skokie marchers as “very fine people.”Particularly since the rise of Trump, many on the American right are intent on shattering taboos around racist or sexist ideas. The alt-right, which often targets college campuses, wants to open up our basic social consensus about human equality to debate, to make it possible to freely ponder whether women and people of color are inferior to white men. Those who care about civil rights are correct to hold the line, to say that there are certain ideas that deserve broad contempt rather than a fair hearing.The problem is that we have no agreement about which ideas are beyond the pale, and the people least willing to draw necessary distinctions are the most strident. Student activists are naturally going to test boundaries and make maximalist demands. Yet while I’m under no illusion that they’re interested in the opinions of Gen X liberals like myself, someone should tell them that if the principle of free speech is curtailed, those with the least power are most likely to feel the chill.Consider where we are right now. Despite the self-parodic actions of some college students, the greatest threats to free speech in the United States are on the right. Our demagogic president demands that (mostly black) athletes be fired for engaging in peaceful protest. On Thursday, he sent a tweet suggesting that the Senate Intelligence Committee investigate the “Fake News Networks.”The Justice Department plans to retry a left-wing protester, Desiree Fairooz, who was arrested for laughing at Sessions during his confirmation hearing and whose conviction for disorderly and disruptive conduct was tossed out by a judge in July. Since Donald Trump’s inauguration, legislators in nearly 20 states have proposed laws to curb protests, including bills that would immunize drivers who hit demonstrators blocking roadways.Leftists may have a measure of power on college campuses, but the right can reach them there, too. Fox News regularly singles out left-wing professors for denunciation. In June, an adjunct professor in New Jersey was fired after an appearance on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” in which she defended a blacks-only Memorial Day celebration and mocked white people who objected.Though we often hear about pro-Israel students who feel intimidated by the campus left, pro-Palestine students regularly face censorship as well. When I asked Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney with the A.C.L.U.’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, about where she saw the biggest threat to campus free speech, she didn’t hesitate: “I think the most pernicious pattern of censorship on college campuses might relate to Palestinian activists.”I understand that for a lot of young leftists, it doesn’t make sense to equate what they see as hate speech with the speech of the oppressed. It’s harder for me to understand why they think that if First Amendment protections are weakened, the left — and not, say, the Trump administration — will be allowed to define what is hateful and what is not. After all, it is extremely common to hear people on the right describe Black Lives Matter as a hate group. A Louisiana police officer injured in a protest against police brutality recently tried to sue the movement and one of its most prominent members for incitement.It’s certainly true that it’s easier to enjoy free speech when you’re privileged. It doesn’t follow from that, however, that eroding free speech protections helps the vulnerable. When disputes about free speech are adjudicated not according to broad principles but according to who has power, the left will mostly lose. If the students at William and Mary aren’t frightened off activism by their experience with national notoriety, they’ll probably learn that soon enough. Luckily, if they ever do come face to face with forces determined to shut them up, the A.C.L.U. will be there.', 'FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – A 30-page report released by a sheriff\'s office in the aftermath of a mass shooting at a Florida airport details how an Alaska man waited at a baggage carousel for several minutes last January before being paged to pick up the bag containing his gun, which officials said he used to kill five people and injure six others.Delta Airlines was paging Esteban Santiago, 27, to retrieve the bag after his flight arrived at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Jan. 6. Minutes after he picked up the bag, the shooting began.The SunSentinel reported that the document is the Broward Sheriff\'s Office\'s final review of its actions following the mass shooting. The page by Delta is a new detail in the airport shooting. The report didn\'t disclose whether airline officials knew what was in the bag.On that afternoon, passengers from all terminals at the airport fled in a panic over erroneous reports of an additional airport shooter. The report also shed light on the extent of the radio problems police and fire personnel encountered in attempting to communicate as state, local and federal officials answered calls for backup and converged on the airport.The report says that at one point, the crush of users sent the system into a "fail-soft" mode and all connections between responding agencies were lost. Dispatchers were not able to quickly reconnect groups and told "all units to stop transmitting until the radio bridges could be restored."It took about four minutes, the report said. But the system began to "throttle," which resulted in garbled transmissions in which Broward Sheriff\'s Office deputies and fire officials could only hear parts of words or phrases.Santiago, of Anchorage, Alaska, was caught by a deputy within minutes of the shooting. But an hour and a half later, the false reports of additional gunfire resulted in bedlam at the busy airport. A U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officer thought he heard shots and relayed the information to a sheriff\'s officer fire captain who broadcast it over the radio as: "Border Patrol reporting shots fired in Terminal 2," the SunSentinel reported."The words "shots fired" spread throughout the airport and triggered pandemonium as thousands of travelers, airline and airport employees began to escape from the concourses, gates, baggage claim areas, curbside loading areas and parking garages of all four terminals," the report stated.Sheriff Scott Israel, in an introduction to the report, said the review is an effort to "objectively review and assess" its response to the deadly shooting. The report is much shorter and far less critical than a 99-page draft report released in June that faulted the agency for failing to seize control and set up an effective command system, the newspaper reported.Santiago has pleaded not guilty to a 22-count indictment. He has stopped taking anti-psychotic medication to treat schizophrenia but remains mentally competent to stand trial, his lawyer told a judge last month.The Justice Department may seek the death penalty in a trial currently set for January.', '                                    Muslim pilgrims move around the Kaaba inside the Grand Mosque during the Hajj in Mecca.

The man was allegedly told by the school\'s principal that lessons the next year would be even more upsetting to him.The class assignment, “Cities: Connecting the Islamic Word,” was published in an excerpt from a book byCAMERA, the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting.“As our concluding project on the Islamic world, you will work in groups to simulate a historical hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca in class," a teacher wrote in the assignment description. "Each of you will be part of a group of Muslim pilgrims from one of the following eight Islamic cities or regions, around a rough time period.”One of the eight “Islamic” cities is Jerusalem, and students are instructed to set up a “tent,” which will display newspaper articles about “their” cities and cultural artifacts to represent their Islamic “hometowns.”An assignment give to ninth graders at a public school in Newton, Massachusetts asking them to “go on an imaginary hajj.”(Obtained via MPRL by Judicial Watch, Inc. )The CAMERA report, “Indoctrinating Our Youth: How a U.S. Public School Curriculum Skews the Arab-Israeli Conflict and Islam,” is a case study on allegedly biased materials used by Newton Public Schools to teach 9th and 10thgraders about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Islamic history and culture. Newton is located about seven miles outside Boston, in a Middlesex County suburb.“Citizens of Newton have been waging a minor war with school officials for years now, trying to get them to use balanced curriculum in their teaching materials on the subject of Islam and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,”Judicial WatchSenior Investigator Bill Marshall told Fox News.Marshall detailed his investigation, alongside chairman ofCitizens for National SecurityDr. Bill Saxton, in anop-edfor the American Thinker. The results of the research compiled by Saxton and Marshall were used in the CAMERA report.Newton parents and residents contacted Saxton, who heads CFNS, a Florida-based research organization that vets textbooks for factual accuracy to get them corrected or removed. Saxton spearheaded the two-year effort with Marshall at Judicial Watch to get the release of nearly 600 pages of teaching material from the Newton Public Schools.Saxton told Fox News the Newton school board and superintendent were “very uncooperative” and “non-transparent” regarding what was in their textbooks.“I’m not sure we got everything,” Saxton said. “[But] we got so much damning material to go ahead with it.”He added: “Parents and grandparents have absolutely no idea what their children and grandchildren are reading and hearing in school about history and geography. How many of them have read or looked at their textbooks, for example?”Marshall said the teaching materials “use as little, if any material on the violent history of Islam.” In onelesson planon the "Spread of Islam"the teacher’s notes indicate Muslim conquerors acted “decently” to their subjects.“When you hear so much caterwauling from the Left about religion being mixed in the school, it’s a little troubling when kids are being asked to go on an imaginary Hajj,” Marshall said.Saxton called it an example of a “purposeful attempt to indoctrinate our impressionable high-schoolers with the \'virtues\' of Islam at the expense of Christianity, Judaism and other religions.”Newton Public Schools did not respond to a request for comment.Caleb Parke is an associate editor for FoxNews.com.

Nobody in the Middle East believed that the United States would ever strike Iran, but enough Americans did that the deal went through.President Trump has long opposed the deal, calling it one of the “worst and most one-sided transactions” ever. On Oct. 15, the president faces a deadline to recertify or decertify the agreement; various reports say he will opt for the latter. The deal’s defenders, horrified by this prospect, are once again warning of catastrophe. “Hard to see how abandoning” the Iran deal “doesn’t lead to war,” tweeted Samantha Power, a former ambassador to the United Nations.Such scare tactics were dishonest enough in 2015. Today, in view of the agreement’s ruinous consequences, they are morally indefensible.The alternative was never war, but a better deal. Rather than lifting sanctions on Iran, allowing it to retain its nuclear infrastructure and develop more advanced centrifuges, a better deal could have ramped up pressure on the Islamic Republic. This would have stripped Iran of capacities like uranium enrichment, which is unnecessary for a civilian energy program, and linked any deal to changes in Iran’s support for terrorism, its regional aggression and its gross violation of human rights at home.A better deal also would not have removed restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in 2025. That “sunset clause” is overlooked by the agreement’s proponents, who stress that Iran has so far complied with the deal. But why wouldn’t Iran comply right now? In a mere eight years it can reactivate its nuclear plants and rapidly enrich enough uranium for dozens of nuclear bombs. Instead of blocking Iran’s path to nuclear weapons, the agreement paves it.Supporters of the agreement further assert that it curbs Iran’s funding of terrorism and its threats against other states. Just the opposite has happened. With billions of dollars in sanctions relief, the regime is solidifying its rule over Syria, Iraq and Yemen, tightening its stranglehold on Lebanon, and increasing its bankrolling of Hezbollah and Hamas. And, in flagrant defiance of the United Nations, Iran is developing and testing intercontinental ballistic missiles that can carry multiple nuclear warheads. Meantime, the ayatollahs have pledged to destroy Israel and, ultimately, America. Rather than reducing the likelihood of war, the agreement has made many wars inevitable.In 2015, the agreement’s promoters insisted that the United States could no longer maintain an international front against Iran and that sanctions, set up to last indefinitely, would soon unravel. Now they predict that the international community will not follow America’s lead in withdrawing from the deal and reimposing sanctions. Worse, they warn, Iran might use the opportunity to evict United Nations inspectors and ramp up its nuclear program.All of these assumptions are false.Had American sanctions on Iran remained in place in 2015, companies would have had to choose between doing business with the United States, the world’s top-ranked economy by gross domestic product, and Iran, ranked 27th. That same stark choice will confront businesses if sanctions are reinstated.Similarly, the contention that Iran will rush to make nuclear weapons in the absence of an agreement is unfounded. Iran could have made that rush well before 2015 but it did not. The reason was the 2012 speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the United Nations General Assembly and the implicit military threat that backed it up.The world, he declared, must not allow Iran to amass enough highly enriched uranium to produce a nuclear bomb. “Red lines don’t lead to war,” he said. “Red lines prevent war.” That red line will remain indelible whether the deal is strengthened or canceled. What was true in 2015 holds equally today: The more credible the military option, the lesser the chance it will need to be used.The agreement’s apologists say that altering or negating the agreement will irreparably harm America’s prestige. Yet it is difficult to see how America’s status is served by a refusal to stand up to Iran’s complicity in the massacre of half a million Syrians and its efforts to annihilate American allies.Israel’s position on the Iran deal was and remains clear. “Fix it or nix it,” Prime Minister Netanyahu recently told the United Nations. If canceled, the deal must be replaced by crippling sanctions that force Iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons capacity. Fixing the deal would include conducting stricter inspections of suspect Iran nuclear sites, imposing harsher penalties for Iranian violations and, above all, eliminating the “sunset clause.”Either way, revisiting the agreement will send an unequivocal message to the world. It will say that Iran’s state-funded terrorism and its attempts to establish a Shiite empire will not be tolerated. The weakness of the Iran deal invites wars, it will say, while displays of strength prevent them. It will say that the United States is truly unwilling to accept a nuclear Iran — not now, not in a decade, not ever.', 'Under Mr. Trump, America Surrenders - The New York TimesAmericans have long struggled with the question of whether this country should be more involved in world affairs, or less. The contest of ideas between internationalists and isolationists has been particularly fierce among Republicans, going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft and continuing on to the beginning of World War II.But since the end of that war, whatever the differences in their priorities and points of emphasis, every president has chosen engagement rather than retreat, sometimes with surprising and positive outcomes. Richard Nixon forged relations with communist China; Ronald Reagan, having consigned the Soviet Union to “the ash heap of history,” went on to negotiate arms control treaties with Mikhail Gorbachev. Even those like Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama who argued in various ways for scaling back America’s commitments overseas insisted on a leadership role, if not the leadership role, in building an international system grounded in democratic and free-market principles.There have been plenty of mistakes and unforeseen developments that have tested the United States and raised questions about the wisdom of its policies. But, on the whole, the world has benefited greatly from America’s guidance and its willingness to engage with allies at every step of the way. NATO, the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are all part of the architecture of global security and development that American presidents helped create.President Trump is now taking a sledgehammer to that system. His argument, if that term can apply to such an inchoate position, is that America for too long has been “losing,” a situation he has set out to correct with nonnegotiable demands and gratuitous confrontations. He promises both to achieve more and to retrench. He promises to put “America first” while at the same time condemning it to a secondary role in global deliberations. It is a bizarre and contradictory policy: In seeking to liberate the United States from international obligations, and in waging war on multilateral institutions, he is not only destroying America’s reputation as a trusted ally but also ceding the future to the very same aggressive powers, especially the authoritarian regimes of China and Russia, that he purports to protect Americans from. Meanwhile, his running feuds with the free press, the courts and Congress are diminishing America’s standing as a bastion of constitutional liberties.The latest assaults occurred last week, when, in the space of a few days, Mr. Trump walked away from or threatened to walk away from an important agreement on Iran, a relationship with Unesco and the North American Free Trade Agreement, painstakingly negotiated in the first Bush and the Clinton administrations.For more than a year Mr. Trump denigrated the Iran deal, under which Iran would substantially halt its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. On Friday he formally disavowed it by refusing to certify that Iran is in compliance. While he stopped short of explicitly killing the accord or rewriting it, the president did it great harm and kicked its fate to Congress, where its future is uncertain.He did so despite the advice of his top people — the secretaries of defense and state and his military and intelligence chiefs — who say the agreement is in America’s interest; and despite the assurance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran 24/7 under a robust verification regime, that Tehran is abiding by its terms.The countries that negotiated the deal with Mr. Obama — Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia — also begged the White House to stick with it. But Mr. Trump demonstrated once again that he can’t abide his predecessor’s accomplishments, that he will not be persuaded by facts and that he places little or no value on the idea that honoring national commitments safeguards confidence in America’s word. Why would North Korea negotiate with the United States over its nuclear stockpile when it sees how little store the Trump administration sets by diplomatic accords?America’s European allies, outraged by Mr. Trump’s decision, have since reaffirmed their commitment to the deal, which includes encouraging European companies to invest in Iran. (Emmanuel Macron is reportedly considering a visit to Tehran, which would be a first for a French president since the 1970s.)Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, because of its anti-Israel bias, is not likely to be nearly as consequential as his opposition to the Iran deal, although it extends his war on international obligations. And his threat to tear up Nafta is still just a threat, albeit an ominous one.Most economists agree that Nafta contributed to some job losses in manufacturing but that abandoning it would hurt the economy over all. Even American industries that brought some production back within the borders would probably use fewer workers than in the past, because of automation. Further, other sectors of the economy, like agriculture and services, would stand to lose business if Canada and Mexico imposed higher tariffs on American imports. Whatever gains the United States might enjoy by torpedoing Nafta are unlikely to be enough to justify alienating two of its most important allies and neighbors.If revoked or substantially renegotiated, Nafta would join an already sizable list of agreements on which Mr. Trump has reneged, including the Paris accord on climate change and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, another trade agreement. He has meanwhile raised doubts in various speeches and offhand remarks about his commitment to the United Nations and to NATO. And to what end? The stock answer is that he is seeking to placate and energize his “base” — the voters troubled by economic decline — by building a wall not just against immigrants but against economic competition and foreign entanglements, thereby making their lives and livelihoods more secure. In an economically interdependent world, that is a false promise. It also undermines critically important global relationships, erodes American credibility and cedes influence and the investment opportunities that go with it to ambitious nations like China that are only too happy to fill the role.America First, Mr. Trump says. America last is more like it.', 'McCain the Hedgehog vs. Bannon the Honey Badger - The New York TimesIt isn’t hard to guess who John McCain had in mind when, in a speech on Monday at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia — the finest speech of his storied political career — he denounced the “half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.”It’s easy to guess, too, the names of the Senate and House Republicans Stephen Bannon had in mind when, at a Values Voter Summit in Washington over the weekend, he declared “a season of war against the G.O.P. establishment.”McCain and Bannon are the antipodes of the Republican Party. The institutionalist versus the insurgent. The internationalist versus the America Firster. The maverick versus the ideologue.Above all, the hedgehog versus the honey badger.The hedgehog, said the Greek poet Archilochus, knows one big thing. McCain knows honor. He refused early release from prison camp in Hanoi to save his honor. He reproved Republican voters for calling Barack Obama an Arab in 2008 to save his party’s honor. He championed the surge in Iraq when it was least popular, to save the country’s honor.He paid for all of it and will be remembered as a giant among dwarves because of it.Right now, McCain, his allies and their ideas appear to be a waning force in the Republican Party. They are RINOs, cucks, and “globalists.” Many of them, like Tennessee’s Bob Corker, will retire rather than face bruising primary challenges from the ever-farther right. On Monday McCain called America “the land of the immigrant’s dream,” and said: “We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil.” To a large and growing segment of the G.O.P., which thinks magnanimity is for losers, these statements amount to a form of treason.The honey badger, by contrast, will do anything to get what it wants. It is wily, nasty and has as much use for honor as a pornographer has for dress. In the 2016 presidential campaign, according to biographer Joshua Green, Bannon treated white supremacists as useful fellow travelers and urged Donald Trump to persist in what seemed to many to be his use of anti-Jewish tropes. Later he waged a smear campaign against H.R. McMaster on the grounds that the national security adviser was anti-Israel.For the honey badger, it’s whatever works: anti-Semite one day; Israel’s make-believe champion the next. Bannon is the most revolting operator in American political life since Roy Cohn. He is also the most consequential one.In his speech, Bannon asked of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell: “Who’s going to be Brutus to your Julius Caesar”? Caesar was stabbed 23 times on the floor of the Roman Senate on the 15th of March, 44 B.C. John Wilkes Booth also invoked Brutus from the stage of Ford’s Theatre after he had assassinated Lincoln, the father of the Republican Party. This is what now passes for acceptable speech among the G.O.P.’s “values voters.”Bannon thinks he can get away with this because he already has. He did so to spectacular effect last year with Donald Trump, and again last month in Alabama with Judge Roy Moore. He will run this play as often as he can, whether his candidates win or lose. The goal isn’t to win elections but to purge the party and remake it in Bannon’s image. He wasn’t kidding when he told historian Ronald Radosh in 2013 that he’s a “Leninist.”It also helps Bannon that the Roll-Over Republicans who might oppose him lack the political courage to do so. Winston Churchill said of the neutral countries in World War II, “each one hopes that if he feeds the crocodile enough, the crocodile will eat him last.” Think of Paul Ryan as the moral equivalent of Norway.What might stop Bannon? Nobody should expect G.O.P. invertebrates to ever gain a spine. But Judge Moore is in a dead heat with Doug Jones, his Democratic opponent, in what should be the easiest Republican cakewalk of the season. Even the stupid party might remember its Senate nominations of Delaware’s Christine “I’m not a witch” O’Donnell and Missouri’s Todd “legitimate rape” Akin.But parties need more than just the spur of defeat to give voters a sense of moral belonging and political purpose, and in his speech Monday McCain did that:“We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil. We are the custodians of those ideals at home, and their champion abroad. We have done great good in the world. That leadership has had its costs, but we have become incomparably powerful and wealthy as we did. We have a moral obligation to continue in our just cause, and we would bring more than shame on ourselves if we don’t. We will not thrive in a world where our leadership and ideals are absent. We wouldn’t deserve to.”This is the finest expression of the American cause uttered by any major political figure in a generation. It could yet serve as a rallying point for a Republican Party that can save itself from dishonor, win its share of elections, and stand up to the honey badgers who mean to pillage it.', 'Ted Cruz: A Pressure Point for North Korea - The New York TimesOn Oct. 31, the State Department faces a critical decision in our relations with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The Iran-Russia-North Korea sanctions bill enacted in August included legislation I introduced that requires the secretary of state to decide whether to relist North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism within 90 days.Look at the accusations against Pyongyang: the unspeakable treatment of Otto Warmbier; the assassination of a member of the Kim family with chemical weapons on foreign soil; collusion with Iran to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles; cyberattacks on American film companies; support for Syria’s chemical weapons program; arms sales to Hezbollah and Hamas; and attempts to assassinate dissidents in exile. Given this, the decision should be easy. In fact, Americans could be forgiven for wondering why North Korea is not already designated as a sponsor of terrorism.It used to be — and the story behind the decision to remove that designation nearly 10 years ago is the key to understanding America’s failed assumptions about North Korea, how they led to Pyongyang obtaining its nuclear arsenal, and why the United States needs to reverse its approach and relist Pyongyang immediately.On Feb. 13, 2007, the State Department signed a deal with North Korea in pursuit of a grand bargain: exchanging Pyongyang’s promise of eventual denuclearization for Washington’s guarantees for full diplomatic recognition. Standing in the way, however, was a decision President Ronald Reagan made nearly 20 years earlier, designating North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism largely in response to its complicity in a 1987 plane bombing that killed 115 people.Aside from the many stringent limitations a terrorism-sponsor designation imposes on a state, the label serves as a formal indication from the United States that any positive development of diplomatic relations is contingent on abandoning the financing and support of terrorism.Indeed, the State Department linked Pyongyang’s ties to terrorist groups and its nuclear program as a rationale for maintaining the terror designation in 2005. Two years later, Israel destroyed a nuclear reactor believed to have been built with North Korean help in Syria, a designated state sponsor of terrorism. Although all this was understood at the time, the United States elected to delist North Korea in 2008 — and in so doing, again fell back into its pattern of misunderstanding rogue regimes.When North Korea reneged on its promise to forgo nuclear weapons in the early 1990s, President Bill Clinton’s administration put together the “Agreed Framework” that paved Pyongyang’s path to nuclearization. When North Korea’s leader at the time, Kim Jong-il, withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 2003, confirming that he intended to build a nuclear weapon, President George W. Bush pushed for the China-led six-party talks with North Korea. When the country tested its second nuclear weapon in 2009, President Barack Obama opted for “strategic patience.” Three subsequent tests showed just how misguided this was.It is time to acknowledge that North Korea may never be interested in negotiating away its nuclear deterrent. Of course we should continue to leave the door open for serious discussions if the situation changes, but the United States government does our citizens — and the world — a disservice if it continually discounts the centrality of nuclear weapons to the Kim regime.They are not a mere insurance policy for survival. They are a means to a more sweeping end: reunification of the Korean Peninsula on Pyongyang’s terms. We must seriously consider the possibility that the North’s current leader, Kim Jong-un, is preparing to use nuclear weapons to drive American forces out of South Korea and coerce Seoul — even at the risk of fighting a limited nuclear war.Given this, the United States must approach North Korea with sobriety and urgency. The Trump administration has the opportunity to join both houses of Congress in acknowledging the truth about North Korea and using it to open new opportunities to maximize pressure.Among North Korea’s many significant forms of illicit financing are foreign slave labor and money laundering. From Africa to Europe, North Korean diplomats exploit their consular posts to launder money at the expense of international comity. If North Korea is relisted, these nations would face a significant decision: Is continuing diplomatic and economic relations with a state that uses diplomacy and finance to export and foment terrorism in their interest?It would pose an even deeper question to the United States: Will we continue our diplomatic overtures to the Kim regime on the flawed assumption that it is interested in a future without nuclear weapons? It is because of America’s bipartisan belief in North Korea’s potential amenity in a political settlement, captured in the 2008 delisting, that North Korea can now marry a miniaturized warhead to an intercontinental ballistic missile. Relisting Pyongyang is the first step toward a strategic vision based on facts rather than aspirations.We must tell the truth about the dangerous ambitions of North Korea and once again list it as a state sponsor of terrorism, a move that only strengthens our hand and weakens that of Kim Jong-un. I strongly urge the State Department to relist North Korea, and to meet this challenge with the resolve it has long demanded.', 'In Rome, a Visit With the Anti-Trump - The New York TimesROME — Walking to the Eternal City, over stones worn down by the sandals of centurions, on a pilgrim’s path nearly forgotten in all the layers of Italian time, the mind focuses as the muscles stiffen.The Vatican is 100 kilometers (about 62 miles) away, according to a Via Francigena sign, and after another two-dozen gut-busting hills, past too much litter in too many lovely places, now only 50 kilometers distant. At last you come out sweaty and sunburned from an urban forest to see a distant St. Peter’s Basilica — the Oz of global Christianity.What awaits is — for now — the moral center of the universe, and a very politically adept pope. The collapse of honor and principle at a White House led by a man with a pebble for a soul has allowed an enlightened octogenarian to flourish. As President Trump degrades his office by insults, lies and threats to world peace and global health, Pope Francis throws ecclesiastical shade his way.“The more powerful you are,” the pope said earlier this year, “the more responsible you are to act humbly.” Quick, Mr. President, to the dictionary. Humble, humbly, humility.The pope waves from a window at his Sunday appearance. He still projects that lightness of being, wearing his soul on his sleeve. At almost the same time, Trump forwards a tweet of the president of the United States hitting a woman, his political opponent from last year, in the back with a golf ball and knocking her down. Some very funny stuff, believe me.The pope tells the crowd assembled in the square to forgive, even if the person you cannot force yourself to forgive is, say, a Trumpian monster, though he doesn’t name names. Those who cannot let things go, he says, “close our hearts to love for others.”Yeah, well, what does he know? Much more than Trump has yet to figure out. One in four American voters is a Roman Catholic. And a third of those Catholics are Latino. They’re watching Trump, but they’re listening to Francis — on climate change, immigration, refugees, war and peace.The pope’s approval rating in the United States was at 70 percent in a Pew survey at the start of this year, while Trump has been at about half that for much of the last few months. Throughout the world, every country but Russia (and to a small degree, Israel) has a lesser view of the United States under Trump.For years at a time — make that decades — the home of the successor to St. Peter was a house of nasty intrigue, deceit and power put to awful use. Popes fathered wars, and children, had heretics executed or chained to a cell in the belly of Castel Sant’Angelo, the fortress that fronts Vatican City. The Vicar of Christ cut deals with dictators, including a devil’s bargain with Mussolini. With its institutional cover-up of pedophile clerics, the church showed the Mafia a thing or two about organized crime. In matters of sex, it was medieval and hypocritical. It was afraid of science.Now the pope uses science to shame Trump, who stares down a parade of hurricanes and says, nothing to see there. “Whoever denies it has to go to scientists and ask them,” said Francis last week. “They speak very clearly. Scientists are precise.” Can a statue of Galileo in St. Peter’s Square be far behind?On Wednesday, a glorious Roman morning with a bite of fall in the air, the pope holds his general audience. The goofy smile is electric. He’s buoyant. The day before, Trump spoke to the United Nations, a tweet dressed up as a speech. He made a very real threat to wipe out a nation of 25 million people. He would, if he has to, “totally destroy North Korea.”This has always been the implication of having more nukes than the other guy. But diplomacy — another word for Trump to look up — is the art of war by other means. Trump pushed America first, which sounded like “Me, me, me.” He played the petulance card, the grievance card.As Trump went low, the pope went high. A few days earlier, Francis was asked about a Trump decision that could break up the families of 800,000 Dreamers in the United States. “If he is a good pro-life believer, he must understand that family is the cradle of life and one must defend its unity,” Francis answered.People who are hung up on doctrinal changes — angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin arguments over whether divorced Catholics can receive communion or not — are missing the big picture. Behold the Francis doctrine: an expansion of “pro-life” to include help for refugees, the poor, the powerless.Trump doesn’t get it. His nominee to the Vatican is Callista Gingrich, wife of Newt Gingrich. Newt, you must remember, carried on a six-year extramarital affair with her while impeaching a president for having an affair. Her appointment was something the Vatican of old would do — a cynical ploy. The Vatican of today can marvel at how quickly history pivots on a single person.', 'Las Vegas Shooting Underscores Hotel Security Choices - The New York TimesBefore a gunman killed more than 50 people in Las Vegas on Sunday, the police said he brought an arsenal of rifles past security and up to his 32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay hotel.That the shooter — Stephen Paddock — was able to take at least 17 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition up to a room starkly highlights the security priorities of hospitality companies: Wishing to appear inviting to guests, many hotels employ a lighter touch.Security at most hotels instead focuses on limiting theft, corralling unruly drunks and ferreting out people wandering the halls without a room, said Mac Segal, a security consultant for an executive protection company, AS Solution.Hotels in the United States and Europe have been “much slower on the uptake” regarding the chances of violence, compared to the Middle East and Africa, where he does most of his business, he said.Then there is the matter of guests preferring to be left alone.Explosives scanners and X-ray machines — standard equipment at airport terminals — will continue to be scarce in hotels because of the enormous premium that customers place on their privacy, said Jim Stover, a senior vice president of the real estate and hospitality practice at the Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., an insurance brokerage.“The hospitality industry hasn’t gotten its act together in terms of antiterrorism,” he said. “It’s not going to be pushed, it has to be pulled.”In countries where hotels have been targeted by attackers — Egypt, Indonesia, Israel and more — security tactics are much more intense and often invasive.India provides an example of the rapid changes violence can prompt. In 2008, terrorists bombed two hotels in downtown Mumbai and attacked other sites around the city, holding hostages and killing more than 100 people. Later, major hotel chains like Marriott, Taj and Accor began using explosive trace detectors and X-ray systems throughout the country. In New Delhi, the upscale Lemon Tree Premier hotel set up face-recognition software that allowed employees to identify visitors as they approached the property.Mandalay Bay, an MGM Resorts International hotel, did not comment on its security practices Monday evening.Even at major hotels, security teams are often lightly staffed and poorly paid, with no more than a few dozen employees for more than 1,000 rooms, Mr. Stover said.As a result, said Jan D. Freitag, a senior vice president with STR, which tracks hotel data worldwide, hotels are “a soft target — always have been and always will be.”Katherine Lugar, chief executive of the American Hotel & Lodging Association, said in a statement that “hotels have safety and security procedures in place that are regularly reviewed, tested and updated as are their emergency response procedures.”The trade group “will continue to work with law enforcement to evaluate these measures,” she said.Some hotel chains have policies covering firearms on their properties. Hilton said that hotels managed by the company “prohibit firearms on-site.” In some of its hotels, Hyatt allows guests to bring permitted, unloaded guns “for storage purposes only,” requiring that the weapons remain locked in a firearms container.“But without any security checkpoints, it becomes very challenging to enforce any type of prohibition,” said Stephen Barth, a lawyer and hospitality professor at the University of Houston.Glenn Cunningham, the director of security at the Greenwich Hotel in Manhattan’s TriBeCa neighborhood and a retired New York City police detective, said he is always armed and on alert.He set up a network of cameras — both operating and nonfunctional — to give the impression of complete coverage. He ordered the bellman — “the first line of defense and a walking videotape,” he said — to keep him constantly updated.And employees are trained to react in an active shooter scenario, Mr. Cunningham said.“We tell them that if they see something in a hotel room — wires, drugs, even if they think it’s the silliest thing — to just mention it to their supervisor.”Without better training, prevention efforts are moot, Mr. Segal said.Upscale hotels spend nearly half a million dollars, on average, on closed-circuit camera systems and dedicate even more money to state-of-the-art door locks and fire suppression systems, he said.But few teach employees to identify suspicious behaviors and patterns such as aggression, paying in cash or repeated visits, he said.“No camera has ever stopped a gunman,” Mr. Segal said.', 'MEXICO CITY – The Latest on earthquakes in Mexico (all times local):8:15 p.m.The U.S. Geological Survey says the new earthquake to strike Mexico had a magnitude of 6.2 and was centered in the southern state of Oaxaca.That\'s the region most shaken by a magnitude 8.1 quake that hit on Sept.It also swayed buildings in Mexico City, which is trying to recover from a magnitude 7.1 temblor that struck on Thursday, killing at least 295 people.It\'s not immediately clear if the new quake caused damage or injury.___8:10 a.m.A strong aftershock has rolled through Mexico City, swaying buildings and sending some people running into the street.The quake was much weaker than the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that hit on Tuesday, killing at least 295 people and knocking down buildings across the capital.It was not immediately clear if there were any new injuries or damage from the latest quake.A magnitude 8.1 earthquake struck earlier this month near the state of Chiapas.___3 a.m.In the stylish Condesa neighborhood, young revelers typically spill out from dimly lit bars and restaurants on a Friday night. But the first weekend since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake toppled buildings just blocks away began on a somber note.Instead of crowds gathered with beers, small handfuls of rescue workers still dressed in reflective vests took breaks from digging through rubble. Entire restaurants with white linen tables were empty. Metal gates shuttered others."It feels lifeless," said Mariana Aguilar, 27, a hostess at a bar and restaurant who stood waiting for guests yet to arrive.The upscale Mexico City neighborhood was one of the hardest hit by the quake that killed at least 295 people, with more than a half-dozen collapsed buildings in the immediate vicinity. The few Condesa residents who ventured out Friday night said they were anxious for relief from an anguishing week."The city is still quite tense," said Israel Escamilla, an engineer, as he sipped a plastic cup filled with Coke at an empty bar. "But as good Mexicans we have to keep lending support however we can."___3 a.m.As earthquake rescue operations stretched into Day 5, Mexico City residents throughout the city held out hope that dozens still missing might be found alive.More than half the dead —157 — perished in the capital, while another 73 died in the state of Morelos, 45 in Puebla, 13 in Mexico State, six in Guerrero and one in Oaxaca.Along a 60-foot stretch of a bike lane in Mexico City\'s downtown, families huddled under tarps and donated blankets Friday, awaiting word of loved ones trapped in the four-story-high pile of rubble behind them."There are moments when you feel like you\'re breaking down," said Patricia Fernandez Romero, who was waiting for word on the fate of her 27-year-old son. "And there are moments when you\'re a little calmer. ... They are all moments that you wouldn\'t wish on anyone."Along the bike lane, where families slept in tents, accepting food and coffee from strangers, people have organized to present a united front to authorities, who they pressed ceaselessly for information.They were told that water and food had been passed along to at least some of those trapped inside. Fernandez said officials told them they knew where people were trapped on the fourth floor.It\'s the moments between those bits of information that torment the families.', 'WASHINGTON – Nearly 300 species of fish, mussels and other sea critters hitchhiked across the Pacific Ocean on debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami, washing ashore alive in the United States, researchers reported Thursday.It is the largest and longest marine migration ever documented, outside experts and the researchers said. The scientists and colleagues combed the beaches of Washington, Oregon, California, British Columbia, Alaska and Hawaii and tracked the species to their Japanese origins. Their arrival could be a problem if the critters take root, pushing out native species, the study authors said in Thursday\'s journal Science."It\'s a bit of what we call ecological roulette," said lead author James Carlton, a marine sciences professor at Williams College, in Williamstown, Massachusetts.It will be years before scientists know if the 289 Japanese species thrive in their new home and crowd out natives. The researchers roughly estimated that a million creatures traveled 4,800 miles (7,725 kilometers) across the Pacific Ocean to reach the West Coast, including hundreds of thousands of mussels.Invasive species is a major problem worldwide with plants and animals thriving in areas where they don\'t naturally live. Marine invasions in the past have hurt native farmed shellfish, eroded the local ecosystem, caused economic losses and spread disease-carrying species, said Bella Galil, a marine biologist with the Steinhardt Museum of Natural History in Tel Aviv, Israel, who wasn\'t part of the study.A magnitude 9 earthquake off the coast of Japan triggered a tsunami on March 11, 2011, that swept boats, docks, buoys and other man-made materials into the Pacific. The debris drifted east with an armada of living creatures, some that gave birth to new generations while at sea."The diversity was somewhat jaw-dropping," Carlton said. "Mollusks, sea anemones, corals, crabs, just a wide variety of species, really a cross-section of Japanese fauna."The researchers collected and analyzed the debris that reached the West Coast and Hawaii over the last five years, with new pieces arriving Wednesday in Washington. The debris flowed across the North Pacific current, as other objects do from time to time, before it moved north with the Alaska current or south with the California current. Most hit Oregon and Washington.Last year, a small boat from Japan reached Oregon with 20 good-sized fish inside, a kind of yellowtail jack native to the western Pacific, Carlton said. Some of the fish are still alive in an Oregon aquarium. Earlier, an entire fishing ship — the Sai sho-Maru — arrived intact with five of the same 6-inch fish swimming around inside.Co-author Gregory Ruiz, a Smithsonian marine ecologist, is especially interested in a Japanese parasite in the gills of mussels. Elsewhere in the world, these parasites have taken root and hurt oyster and mussel harvests and they hadn\'t been seen before on the West Coast.The researchers note another huge factor in this flotilla: plastics.Decades ago, most of the debris would have been wood and that would have degraded over the long ocean trip, but now most of the debris — buoys, boats, crates and pallets — are made of plastic and that survives, Carlton said. And so the hitchhikers survive, too."It was the plastic debris that allowed new species to survive far longer than we ever thought they would," Carlton said.James Byers, a marine ecologist at the University of Georgia in Athens, who wasn\'t part of the study, praised the authors for their detective work. He said in an email that the migration was an odd mix of a natural trigger and human aspects because of the plastics."The fact that communities of organisms survived out in the open ocean for long time periods (years in some cases) is amazing," he wrote.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears.

Don’t do it, Mr. President. Be a statesman, listen to your own military and intelligence officials and put the security of America and its allies ahead of your ego.Certification isn’t a requirement of the 2015 deal, in which Iran, after negotiations with the United States and five other major powers, agreed to roll back its nuclear program in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Certification was required by Congress, which passed a law mandating that the president decide every 90 days whether Iran is fulfilling its commitments and whether the deal is in America’s national interest.A decision by Mr. Trump to withhold certification would not, therefore, automatically “tear up” the agreement, as he promised to do in the 2016 campaign. It would, rather, kick the  issue back to Congress, which could then decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions. But that in itself is a risk; and in any case, Mr. Trump’s expression of displeasure with the agreement can only alienate this country’s closest allies, which worked so hard to get a deal.Mr. Trump is in a box of his own making. As a candidate, with no experience in foreign policy, he took a hard line against the deal, and he has stuck with that position, recently describing it in a speech to the United Nations as “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.” That judgment seems to reflect Mr. Trump's knee-jerk habit of repudiating President Barack Obama’s accomplishments, as well as showing the influence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who considers the Iran deal a travesty. Plus, historical antipathy to Iran in the United States remains strong.Mr. Trump has twice agreed to certify the Iran deal, and his national security advisers are urging him to do it again. But he reportedly is annoyed by the process, and is determined to deliver on his campaign promise by the next certification deadline, Oct. 15. That the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran’s nuclear activities; the American intelligence community; and the Pentagon confirm that Iran is honoring its commitments seems to have no effect on Mr. Trump’s thinking.While most of Congress opposed the Iran deal when it was negotiated, many members now see its value and oppose provoking another nuclear crisis as the United States grapples with North Korea. But there is no guarantee of what Congress will do if a bill is introduced reimposing sanctions or seeking to renegotiate the deal. The smart thing, the right thing, for Mr. Trump to do is to recertify. There’s no doubt that Iran is a bad actor on many fronts, not least in its roles in Syria and Yemen. But the United States will have a greater chance of addressing those concerns if it rigorously abides by the nuclear deal and maintains unity with its partners in that endeavor.", 'President Trump’s Failing Leadership on Iran - The New York TimesPresident Trump has made clear his hostility toward the Iran nuclear deal, labeling it “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has entered into.” He is right: The ill-constructed deal left Iran with an industrial-scale nuclear program which, when the pact’s terms begin to expire, will provide Iran with a clear pathway to nuclear weapons.But true leadership requires Mr. Trump to do more than focus solely on Iran’s nuclear program; he must also address the broader threats that Iran poses to the region.Under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, the bipartisan Senate compromise used by the Obama administration to get Congress to buy into the nuclear deal, the president must certify every 90 days that, among other things, Iran is fully implementing the nuclear pact and has not committed a material breach. The president must also attest that the agreement is vital to the security interests of the United States.Proponents and opponents of the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, argue about whether Iran is in compliance. Much of the dispute rests on the scope of inspections and access to certain suspect sites. For example, the International Atomic Energy Agency is currently unable to verify the provision relating to “activities which could contribute to the design and development of a nuclear explosive device.” That Russia contends Iran has no obligation to satisfy the I.A.E.A. on this matter highlights the deal’s weakness.The Trump administration is signaling that it plans not to recertify the nuclear agreement before an Oct. 15 deadline. But doing that won’t end the pact. It simply punts the problem over to Congress, which will then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran. The administration has suggested that it will not push Congress to do anything specific, and chances are that Congress will agree.For the president to pass the buck displays neither leadership nor courage. At a minimum, Mr. Trump needs to tell members of Congress what he wants them to do, and then work to ensure the resulting legislation can pass. And whether he decertifies the pact or not, the president must decide by Jan. 12 whether to waive once again the application of one in a broad set of sanctions that existed before the deal was struck and that have been suspended since. It is these waivers, not presidential certifications under the review law, that keep the nuclear deal alive.Last month, at the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Trump demanded freedom for American hostages held by Tehran and called on Iran’s government to “stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.” Fine words, but it remains unclear what the president plans to do to have his demands realized.Partisans may trade blame, but whether because of the 2003 United States-led invasion of Iraq or the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq in 2011, Iran’s efforts to destabilize the Middle East have accelerated. The Syrian civil war only contributed to the perfect storm. Tehran is now aggressively interfering in countries from Afghanistan to the Eastern Mediterranean, and perhaps even farther. And while some place blame on Sunni governments such as Saudi Arabia for providing Iran with opportunities to meddle, Sunni repression hardly excuses Iran’s transfer of weapons to Yemen, Lebanon and others in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions or Tehran’s broader efforts to undermine American allies like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.Strangely, however, Mr. Trump has done little to push back on Iranian expansionism. The United States provides cursory support for operations by the Saudis and United Arab Emirates against Iranian-backed forces in Yemen. And for most of this year, the administration has been funneling financial aid to the Lebanese armed forces, which in turn have been working hand in hand with Iran’s most powerful proxy, Hezbollah, on the Lebanon-Syria border. While the administration has offered inconsistent and lackluster support for the Arab nations challenging Qatar’s support for extremists, it has largely ignored Iran’s growing influence in both Qatar and Oman.Mr. Trump’s oddest capitulations to Iran are in Iraq and Syria. Rather than seize opportunities to push back on Iranian power while pursuing the annihilation of the Islamic State, Team Trump has largely embraced Obama-era nonpolicies in both states. In Iraq, the central government is desperate for assistance to rein in Iranian-backed militias that may have contributed to the fight against the Islamic State but now threaten the country’s stability. If the goal is to prevent a repeat in Iraq of Hezbollah’s slow strangulation of Lebanon, the time is now.Similarly in Syria, despite early hints that he was poised to take on the Tehran-Moscow-Damascus triumvirate, Mr. Trump has been almost supine, to the point of ignoring attacks on American-backed forces. The White House has even shrugged off news that Iran has opened another front against Israel in the Syrian Golan Heights.If rolling back and diminishing Iranian power is the priority Mr. Trump insists it is, simply dumping the nuclear agreement in Congress’s lap may be the worst possible option. That would be politically easy, but it won’t get the job done.', 'We Work. We Live. We Work Out. Eventually We Die. - The New York TimesFirst, WeWork did offices. Then came a co-living offshoot, WeLive, in which people rent furnished apartments for months at a time. Now ... WeSweat?In a dimly lit studio in the bowels of 85 Broad Street, Goldman Sachs’s former headquarters in the financial district of New York, Jooin Im sat on a mat before a small class of yogis.Referring to a story she had heard on a “This American Life” podcast, Ms. Im talked about a truck driver who got tired of the grind: the same route, the same street signs, the same paycheck. So he drives off into the sunset (as it were), taking his bus from New York all the way to a moonlit Florida beach. “‘What happens when you take a leap?’” Ms. Im asked, quoting from the podcast.She was leading a class called Flow that has been designed to infuse yoga with an “entrepreneurial spirit,” at Rise by We, a new gym and wellness facility that will open officially next week.Rise is the newest venture from the WeWork company, which has brought foosball-infused bro-deco co-working spaces to 56 cities in 16 countries. The company says it has sold 150,000 memberships that entitle users to work out of the various locations.The goal of “We,” as executives refer to the company, is to overtake any conceivable venue for entrepreneurial-minded up-and-comers who are drawn to a clubby sense of community and the turnkey ease (if impersonal feel) of communal spaces.“We” wants to go from owning the place its members go to work to dictating “ultimately where to live, ultimately where to work out, ultimately where to meet their friends for a drink after work,” said Michael Gross, the company’s vice chairman. (Clearly, next will come WeGotDrunk.)But back to Rise, which the executive team also considered calling WeRun or WeWorkOut.After yoga, WeTook (well?) a tour of the facility, led by Avi Yehiel, WeWork’s head of wellness. He was a professional soccer player in Israel and is married to the sister of Adam Neumann, one of WeWork’s founders. Mr. Yehiel, in addition to at least a couple of WeWork publicists, helped fill the yoga class, although his real love is Pilates.The lobby is chock-full of drinks, snacks and beauty products, many of which are being made or marketed by companies run out of WeWork offices. There is This Granola Is Nuts. Here are Supergoop skin products. “We are always looking for ways to help our members,” Mr. Yehiel said.To that end, Rise, many floors beneath 85 Broad’s WeWork floors, has a turf-covered area with CrossFit-like equipment, a large boxing studio that is heavy with heavy-bags and a cardio room for boot-camp workouts.To extend into WeWork’s overall emphasis on communal habitats, both the male and female locker rooms at Rise lead to a large Jerusalem-stone-tiled area with a coed hot tub and sauna, run by an attendant named Jonathan who gently reminds people taking calls in the sauna that smartphones can melt. “It’s a process of educating people,” he said.As part of an introductory offer, the cost of joining Rise is $180 per month, although the cost of Rise will rise to $250 per month later in the fall. (Membership entitles those who are not WeWork members to use certain WeWork facilities at designated times.) You can also pop in for four visits a month for $100.Kaveh Akbari, 25, is the vice president for marketing and strategic partnerships for MBK Sports Management Group and works out of WeWork’s 85 Broad location. He joined Rise this summer when it offered early membership. Mr. Akbari uses the gym about five times a week, and he likes the efficiency of commuting by elevator. He also loves the coed spa.And he likes how the yoga classes connect his spiritual wellness to his career ambitions. In a recent class he attended, an instructor told the yogis that he sees them as they see their own clients. Here, we are all people with problems who need someone to offer them solutions. “I’m doing the same thing,” the yoga teacher said.', 'Assessing Trump’s Criticisms of Iran and the Nuclear Deal - The New York TimesPresident Trump declared his intention not to recertify the Iran nuclear deal in a forceful speech on Friday. But the rationale he provided includes several misleading or incomplete statements about the terms of the deal, what he considers a violation of the agreement and Iran itself. Here is an assessment.Mr. Trump gave an incomplete account of Iranian history. “Iran is under the control of a fanatical regime that seized power in 1979 and forced a proud people to submit to its extremist rule,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the Islamic Revolution. Clerics led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew the monarch that year and established an Islamic republic. His successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is currently the supreme leader of Iran.Mr. Trump then listed the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, Iran’s sponsorship of terrorism and its support of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria among other examples of the country’s “hostile actions.”All of these actions are undoubtedly hostile, but they require more context, said Abbas Amanat, an Iran scholar at Yale University, who added that the 1979 revolution was a popular movement and that the government, though repressive, has been moderating.Mr. Trump’s history lesson omitted a critical recent turning point: the 2009 Green Movement, when protesters took to Iran’s streets to dispute the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and call for more political freedom. Some even demanded for the removal of Ayatollah Khamenei. In 2013, Iranian voters delivered the presidency to Hassan Rouhani, a more moderate cleric, by a wide margin. His allies made strong gains in parliamentary elections in 2016, and Mr. Rouhani was re-elected this May.“Any attempt to renege or decertify or impose sanctions again has a tremendously negative impact on the current moderates in Iran” who support Mr. Rouhani and, in turn, would fuel hard-liners, Mr. Amanat said.Mr. Trump misled about the deal’s “immediate financial boost” to Iran. Mr. Trump claimed that the deal gave Iran “over $100 billion its government could use to fund terrorism” and a “massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion.” The diplomatic agreement did not cut Iran a check, but it did release about $100 billion in previously Iranian frozen assets. Much of the amount is tied up in debt obligations. For example, $20 billion is owed to China for financing projects in Iran. Estimates for the actual amount available to Iran range from $35 billion to $65 billion.The Obama administration did transfer $1.7 billion to Iran, but Mr. Trump’s statement requires more context. The money — delivered in cash, some on a plane — was payment for a decades-long dispute and was indirectly linked to the nuclear deal.Before the 1979 revolution, Iran’s shah had paid $400 million for American military goods but, after he was overthrown, they were never delivered. The clerics who seized control demanded the money back, but the United States refused. The additional $1.3 billion is interest accumulated over 35 years. An initial reimbursement was released after the Iran deal was implemented and to help secure the release of American hostages.Mr. Trump claimed, without providing evidence, that “the regime intimidated international inspectors into not using the full inspection authorities that the agreement calls for.”The White House did not respond when asked to identify an instance of intimidation. But the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the watchdog group tasked with inspection, has yet to report issues with access.“To my knowledge, there is no evidence of this. The I.A.E.A. has never said that this is the case,” said Richard Nephew, a former sanctions coordinator at the State Department and a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.Yukiya Amano, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s director general, repeatedly stated in a September news briefing that Iran was following the rules. He did not mention any instances of intimidation.“We have had access to locations more frequently than many other countries with extensive nuclear programs,” he said of Iran.After Mr. Trump’s speech on Friday, Mr. Amano issued his own statement.“So far, the I.A.E.A. has had access to all locations it needed to visit,” he said. “At present, Iran is subject to the world’s most robust nuclear verification regime.”Mr. Trump exaggerated when he suggested the deal’s “sunset clauses” are imminent.Mr. Trump claimed that provisions in the deal limiting Iran’s nuclear abilities expire “in just a few years.” In reality, the major provisions last a decade or longer. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a vocal critic of the deal, said it “largely expires after only 15 years.”Iran cannot use more than 5,060 centrifuges to enrich uranium — and it cannot pursue research and development on centrifuges — for 10 years. Limits on enrichment levels, facilities and stockpiles last for 15 years, according to a September report from the Congressional Research Service.Under the terms of the accord, Iran also agreed to convert a deep underground enrichment facility into a “technology center” that cannot contain nuclear material and where the number of centrifuges is limited for 15 years. Several provisions on plutonium, including forbidding the construction of new heavy water reactors, last for 15 years.Inspectors are to monitor centrifuges and related infrastructure for 15 years, verify inventory for 20 years and monitor uranium mines for 25 years.', 'Bowe Bergdahl gives interview to British magazine.The admission is in; the sentence awaits us. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl admitted deserting his Afghan post and endangering fellow troops. By all accounts this is the most serious betrayal of presidential authority in my life time.In 2014 President Obama attempted to cover Bergdahl with the achievement of a war hero, even inviting his Idaho based parents to the Rose Garden to celebrate news of his release. President Obama pointed out at the time that five Taliban leaders were freed from Guantanamo so that Bergdahl could be released from captivity. To gild the lily, National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, said Bergdahl served “the United States with honor and distinction.”Yet everyone in the White House and the Pentagon knew this was a lie with monumental implications. In fact, Army officials refused to list Bergdahl as a POW. An internal 2009 Army report found that he walked off his post on more than one occasion and even said he wanted to join the ranks of the enemy. This report also noted he shipped his laptop back to Idaho with a note expressing his disillusionment with the American position in the war.U.S. President Barack Obama (R) watches as Jami Bergdahl (L) and Bob Bergdahl talk about the release of their son, prisoner of war U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, during a statement in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington May 31, 2014.(REUTERS/Jonathan Erns)President Obama had all of this information at his disposal before he made a deal releasing Bergdahl. Why then did he mislead the American people? The answer can be found in the president’s desire to satisfy antiwar liberals keen on emptying Gitmo. At the Rose Garden event the president admitted as much when he said, “We’re committed to winding down the war in Afghanistan and closing Gitmo.” It is instructive that the CIA has evidence at least three of the released Taliban leaders have returned to the battlefield.One intelligence official argued: “It’s probably a tie as to who is the bigger traitor” – Bergdahl or Obama. With this exchange and the elevation of Bergdahl’s rank, the president compromised national security knowingly and willfully. Although Bergdahl will not receive capital punishment when his sentence is determined, he probably should be tried as a traitor whose actions led directly to three soldiers seriously injured during search and rescue missions to find him. But if this fiasco is linked to American injuries and, perhaps deaths, one might well ask if the commander in chief should be held accountable as well.The president’s dissimulation clearly violated the military code and has had a profound effect on morale. Those I know in the military invariably ask how a president could honor a deserter when he was fully aware of his prior actions. This, of course, wasn’t the first time President Obama allowed politics to determine a course of ethical behavior, but it may be among the most egregious examples. One intelligence official argued: “It’s probably a tie as to who is the bigger traitor” – Bergdahl or Obama. With a political ecology in which standards have been debased, many have attempted to rationalize President Obama’s decision. In my judgment, however, his actions that jeopardized national security should be fully investigated and, where blame exists, the full weight of public opinion should be employed to condemn the president and his assistants.Dr. Herb London is president of the London Center for Policy Research and is co-author with Jed Babbin of "The BDS War Against Israel."', 'Of Course Jerusalem Is Israel’s Capital - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — How long do you think there has been a Jewish temple on Temple Mount in Jerusalem?That is a question I like to ask when I’m leading a discussion with Israelis or Jews from other countries. The most common response is, “Two thousand years.” But that’s actually the answer to a separate question: How long ago did the Romans destroy the Second Temple, beginning the Jewish exile?According to many scholars, there was a temple on that site for nearly 1,000 years before the Roman destruction. That would mean that for about 3,000 years, Jerusalem has been the center of the Jewish people: a physical center when a temple was standing, and a center for prayer and longing from afar after the Jews were dispersed around the globe. Every year, at the very end of Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year, and at the end of the Passover Seder, Jews recite, “Next year in Jerusalem.”Then the Jews came back. In the 19th century, Jews began building neighborhoods and settling outside the walls of Jerusalem’s Old City. Then the  Six-Day War of 1967 ended the short Jordanian rule over the Old City and united Jerusalem under Israeli jurisdiction. But this return has proved more controversial internationally. Even the United States, Israel’s closest ally, has not recognized the city as our capital even though our government has been based there since 1949.President Trump will reportedly soon change that, and even announce that he is moving the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. “Next year, an American Embassy in Jerusalem” was never in our prayers, but it’s still something we welcome as a sign of support — and a recognition of reality.Not that a statement from an American president will actually change Israelis’ commitment to Jerusalem. This is our capital and it always will be. It was taken away from the Jewish people by force. It was recaptured by force. If necessary, it will be preserved under Israel’s jurisdiction by force, too.Israel will, of course, embrace Washington’s change of tune on Jerusalem. But the truth is, Mr. Trump’s announcement is not going to change as much as you might expect. History shows that: Last week, the world marked the 70th anniversary of the United Nations’ 1947 vote on the Partition Plan, when the international community formally adopted a plan for a Jewish state alongside an Arab state in Palestine.This was an important achievement for the Zionist movement, a cause for celebration and a foundational part of Israel’s history and its legitimacy. But the resolution was not the decisive factor in Israel’s birth. More crucial was the reality on the ground. By the time the United Nations passed the resolution, the foundations for a Jewish state were in place. Jews living in Palestine “had achieved a critical developmental and demographic mass,” as the historian Benny Morris recently explained. They were ready and determined. A United Nations resolution was just icing the cake.Similarly, Jerusalem is unmistakably Israel’s capital, whether outsiders accept this fact or not. That’s not to say there aren’t challenges to this reality: The international community is not yet ready to accept it and the Palestinians claim that the city is theirs. The demographic realities are, indeed, tricky. About a third of the city’s residents are Arab. Nonetheless, the facts are the facts.In 1947, ahead of the United Nations vote, the C.I.A. warned that “armed hostilities between Jews and Arabs will break out if the U.N. General Assembly accepts the plan to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states.” President Harry Truman decided to support partition despite the warnings. The C.I.A. was right; the Arabs responded with violence, leading to Israel’s War of Independence. Thanks to that, the Jewish state was even larger than the borders mandated by the United Nations and the Palestinians still don’t have a state. But Truman was right, too; he proved himself a friend of the Jewish people, willing to take risks for what was right.Will a statement recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ignite a similar round of defiance and violence? It’s possible. Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian negotiator, has said that American recognition would “discourage many of those who still believe that a peaceful solution is achievable,” which sounds a lot like a veiled threat. Hamas, the terrorist organization that controls Gaza, called on Palestinians to “incite an uprising in Jerusalem so that this conspiracy does not pass.”It would be a great exaggeration to argue that Mr. Trump bears much resemblance to Harry Truman. But the president — often criticized for being blunt and never shying away from saying what he wants to say — will have his Trumanesque moment by refusing to pretend that Israel has no capital. If violence is the result of that, we will all regret it. But it is worth remembering that Truman’s recognition of Israel was also met with violence — and it is still remembered as a great American moment.', 'Rallying Cry of Jerusalem May Have Lost Force in Arab World - The New York TimesBEIRUT, Lebanon — For decades, the idea of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital served as a rare and powerful rallying cry that united the Arab world.Kings and dictators stumped for it, priests and imams prayed for it, jihadists and protesters died for it, and militant groups and political parties campaigned for it — naming their television stations, boulevards and even themselves, after Al Quds, the Arabic name for the holy city.In officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Wednesday, President Trump struck what many considered the death blow to those aspirations, handing a major victory to Israel in the perennial struggle between Jews and Arabs for control of the Holy Land.But as Arab and Muslim leaders raised their voices to condemn the move, many across the Middle East wondered if so much had changed in recent years that the real Arab response would amount to little more than a whimper.“ ‘Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine’ joins ‘Palestinian refugees are going back home one day’ in the let’s-hope-it-will-happen-but-it-never-will department,” Mustapha Hamoui, a Lebanese blogger, wrote in a rueful tweet.While Arab leaders have continued to pay lip service to the Palestinian cause, it has slipped in importance, displaced by the Arab Spring uprisings, the wars in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, the threat of the Islamic State, and the contest between Saudi Arabia and Iran for regional dominance. Persian Gulf states like Saudi Arabia, more concerned about their rivalry with Iran, have found their interests increasingly overlapping with those of Israel.Arab leaders have often counted on declarations of support for the Palestinian cause as a reliable way to appeal to their people, and sometimes as a distraction from domestic problems, including lack of political freedoms and economic opportunities.But while the passion for the Palestinian cause among many Arabs was genuine, those in power often exploited it for their own aims.When Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia and political party formed to fight Israel, sent fighters to help save President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, claimed in a speech that “the road to Jerusalem” went through a list of Syrian cities, including Aleppo.Critics posted maps on social media showing that that was only true if you took a particularly circuitous route.Palestinian leaders have learned that declarations of concrete support from their Arab brothers only sometimes materialized. And many note that the Arab world has done little more than issue notes of protest as the Israeli government has extended its de facto control over the eastern part of Jerusalem since seizing it from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and annexing it in a move still not recognized by most of the world.The Palestinians’ Arab defenders have meanwhile shifted their own priorities.Egypt, for instance, was once a reliable font of pro-Palestinian anger, where protests against Israel regularly erupted in the 1990s and 2000s. But years of harsh repression under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, combined with broader anxiety over regional stability, have curtailed public protests.“People still care about the Palestine issue,” said Hossam Bahgat, a prominent journalist. “But the proverbial Arab Street has been forcibly disappeared,” he added, referring to a rash of illegal abductions of government critics since the military brought Mr. Sisi to power in 2013.As Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad — three traditional centers of Arab power — have weakened, Saudi Arabia has sought to assert itself.While its royals and monarchs once spoke frequently of the Palestinian cause, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32, who effectively rules the country, has barely addressed the issue in public. He confided to foreign visitors this year that he does not consider the conflict a priority compared with confronting Iran and pursuing domestic reforms.Mr. Sisi and King Salman of Saudi Arabia are among Mr. Trump’s biggest boosters in the Arab world. At a summit in Riyadh in May, the three leaders stood together over a glowing orb for a photo that appeared to cement their alliance, even as it inspired a rash of mocking internet memes.In September, Mr. Sisi met for the first time in public with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, lending smiling optics to a relationship that had been quietly blossoming, largely over security issues, for several years. And Saudi Arabia is widely believed to be expanding covert intelligence cooperation with Israel.But Mr. Trump’s decision on Jerusalem has put his allies in the uncomfortable position of having to turn on him, at least verbally.King Salman called the American move “a dangerous step likely to inflame the passions of Muslims around the world.”Mr. Sisi’s office said that he had spoken with the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, and that both men lamented a decision that “overlooks the special position of Jerusalem for Arabs and Muslims.” Egypt’s state-controlled Al Ahram website went with the headline: “Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state despite Trump’s decision.”King Abdullah II of Jordan, another American ally, said the decision would have “dangerous repercussions on the stability and security of the region.”Outside the Arab world, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey called Jerusalem “ a red line for Muslims” and threatened to cut off relations with Israel.“This is the new adventure of global arrogance in the region,” said President Hassan Rouhani of Iran.It was still possible that Mr. Trump’s declaration could have the effect of moving the Palestinian issue to the front burner, but on Wednesday, the emotions were as much of sadness and resignation as of anger and threats. An explosion of violence could still come, but so far there is something more like an explosion of sighs.Nohad Machnouk, the interior minister of Lebanon, tweeted a clip from a song by Fairouz, the Lebanese diva — “Our home is ours, Jerusalem is ours, and with our hands we will return it to its glory” — the words determined but the music wistful and nostalgic.In some ways, the move is symbolic and only confirms the grim view of the Palestinian future. People in the region have long seen the United States as deeply biased toward Israel and the hopes for a viable Palestinian state as fading.But the American declaration casts into doubt the most important Palestinian hope that was still seen as achievable: a capital in East Jerusalem. Calling Jerusalem the Israeli capital without acknowledging its significance to Arabs comes off to them as a denial of the Muslim and Arab perspective, analysts said.“For Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims, it has the same effect that denial of Jewish claims to Jerusalem has to Jews,” said Barnett R. Rubin, a former senior State Department adviser.Moreover, he said, the move “confirms the narrative that the U.S. is at war with Islam and has no respect for Muslim and Arab perspectives.”That perception is likely to damage the standing of the United States in the region.“This will do tremendous damage to America’s image and interests in the region,” said Nabil Fahmy, a former foreign minister of Egypt. Of Mr. Trump, he added, “He is playing into the hands of the extremists and giving easy ammunition to extremists and terrorists.”The move could also strengthen Iran, giving it back the mantle of resistance it lost when it sided with Syria’s government against an uprising. The elite force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, led by Qasim Souleimani, is called the Quds Force, named for Jerusalem.“We just handed him a claim to lead the cause,” Mr. Rubin said.The focus on Jerusalem may also provide fresh ammunition to violent extremists in the region. The Islamic State’s powerful affiliate in Egypt was born from the militant group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, whose name translates as “Supporters of Jerusalem.”But for many, outrage at Mr. Trump’s actions mixed with a sense of weary resignation. “We’ll see token protests and criticism from some countries,” Nadia Mohamed, a Twitter user from Misurata, Libya, wrote. “The media will make noise and then it will soon be over.”', "                                    Students' Society of McGill University is accused of an anti-Semitic vote to remove a Jewish student leader.

But the college’s General Assembly rejected him after he was the target of a nasty, anti-Semitic smear campaign. The controversial vote was carried out without discussion.“(About) 160 people voted no to a director only because he was Jewish,” the GA presidentsaid, “and the discontent seems to be coming from one issue that is political and has nothing to do with work performance.”McGill has been criticized for anti-Semitism after BDS, the anti-Israel boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, formed on campus. An off-shoot of that movement, Democratize SSMU, has admitted highlighting Lew’s Jewish identity to urge students to oppose him. The group claimed he was “actively harming Palestinian students” by letting his politics interfere with his leadership duties.McGill’s principal, Suzanne Fortier, wrote in astatementthat the university is addressing the “disturbing allegations of anti-Semitism.” She said the allegation will be thoroughly investigated and a task force and support line will be created for the campus community.“I was blocked from participating in student government because of my Jewish identity and my affiliations with Jewish organizations” After the backlash, Democratize SSMU released a statement apologizing.“The material in question has since been deleted, but for transparency’s sake we would like to apologize for the way in which an event created by this campaign was insensitive to anti-Semitic tropes of Jewish people as corrupt and politically powerful,” the statement said. “We thoroughly apologize for any harm that the statement caused. We want to validate that anti-Semitism is not acceptable anywhere, and is a real and toxic force in our society and on campus.”Lew responded to the statement onFacebook.“If BDS is not anti-Semitic,” he said, “why was I barred from participating in student government because of my Jewish identity?”Lew said he had long heard about the student government’s anti-Semitic hostility, but until this incident had never experienced it himself. Before he joined the student governing body, he was told by other students that he should hide his affiliation with Judaism and Jewish organizations.Igor Sadikov, a radical BDS supporter, earlier this year was forced to resign from his position as director of SSMU after he tweeted “punch a Zionist today.”While Lew said the attacks were “incredibly upsetting,” he’s also optimistic.“I am happy that the discriminatory agenda of BDS McGill that has been swept under the rug for years is finally out in the open,” he said, “so that we may all come together to defeat it.”Caleb Parke is an associate editor for FoxNews.com.

Taken together, the two actions signaled a new aggressiveness by the prince both at home and abroad, as well as a new and more dangerous stage in the Saudi cold war with Iran for dominance in the region.“Today confrontation is the name of the game,” said Joseph A. Kechichian, a scholar at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who is close to the royal family. “This young man, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is not willing to roll over and play dead. If you challenge him, he is saying, he is going to respond.”The accusations raise the threat of a direct military clash between the two regional heavyweights at a time when they are already fighting proxy wars in Yemen and Syria, as well as battles for political power in Iraq and Lebanon. By the end of the day Monday, a Saudi minister was accusing Lebanon of declaring war against Saudi Arabia as well.Even before the launching of the missile on Saturday, which was intercepted en route to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, the crown prince had staged another surprise demonstration of the kingdom’s newly aggressive posture toward Iran and Lebanon. The prince hosted a visit from Saudi Arabia’s chief Lebanese client, Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who stunned the region by announcing his resignation, via video from Riyadh, in protest against Iran’s undue influence in Lebanese politics.Even some of Mr. Hariri’s rivals speculated that his Saudi sponsors had pressured him into the statement. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia, said over the weekend that the Saudis had all but kidnapped Mr. Hariri. Mr. Nasrallah urged Mr. Hariri to return to Lebanon for power-sharing talks “if he is allowed to come back.”On Monday, Saudi Arabia released a photograph of Mr. Hariri meeting with King Salman that was widely seen as an effort to contradict the theory that the prime minister was effectively a hostage.The Saudi claims that Iran had provided the missile could not be independently verified.Mr. Jubair, the foreign minister, said the missile had been smuggled into Yemen in parts, assembled in Yemen by operatives from Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran, and fired from Yemen by Hezbollah.A statement from the Saudi Arabian news agency said “experts in military technology” had determined from the remains of that missile and one launched in July that both had come from Iran “for the purpose of attacking the kingdom.”Citing allegations of Hezbollah’s role, Thamer al-Sabhan, minister of state for Persian Gulf affairs, said Monday that Saudi Arabia considered the missile attack an act of war by Lebanon as well.“We will treat the government of Lebanon as a government declaring a war because of Hezbollah militias,” Mr. Sabhan told the Saudi-controlled Al Arabiya network. “Lebanon is kidnapped by the militias of Hezbollah and behind it is Iran.”The top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran called the accusation of Iranian involvement in the missile attack “baseless.”“These missiles were produced by the Yemenis and their military industry,” the commander, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, told the semiofficial news agency Tasnim.Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, accused Saudi Arabia of “wars of aggression, regional bullying, destabilizing behavior & risky provocations,” in a statement on Twitter. Saudi Arabia “bombs Yemen to smithereens, killing 1000’s of innocents including babies, spreads cholera and famine, but of course blames Iran,” Mr. Zarif said.American officials have previously accused Iran of arming its Yemeni allies, the Houthis. But it was unclear how Saudi experts would know how or why Iran provided the missiles.With help from allies including the United Arab Emirates and the United States, Saudi Arabia has enforced a sea and air blockade around Yemen since it launched an attack on the Houthi forces there more than two years ago.In Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed’s grip on power tightened further on Monday. American officials tracking the situation said that as many as 500 people, including at least 11 princes, had been rounded up in a wave of arrests directed by Prince Mohammed in the name of a crackdown on corruption.Some are expected to face undisclosed criminal charges while others may be pressured to testify about their roles in corruption schemes. Men were sleeping on mats on the floor of the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton, which has been transformed into a singularly luxurious prison to house the detainees.The arrests cemented Prince Mohammed’s dominance over military, foreign, internal security, economic and social affairs inside the kingdom, freeing him to pursue an aggressive confrontation with Iran. That posture has been a hallmark of his rise over the two and a half years since his father, King Salman, 81, took the throne.Prince Mohammed has sharply escalated a cold war with Iran, stepping up Saudi Arabia’s efforts to push back Iranian influence in the Syrian civil war, plunging the kingdom into a protracted military conflict against Iranian-allied forces in Yemen, and isolating neighboring Qatar in part for being too close to Iran.His hawkish stance toward Iran also appears to have formed the basis for a close bond with President Trump, who visited Riyadh this year and maintained a conspicuous silence over the weekend about Prince Mohammed’s campaign of arrests. On Tuesday while traveling in Asia, he praised the arrests, saying the king and crown prince “know exactly what they are doing.”Mr. Trump’s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, recently left Riyadh after his third visit this year. Prince Mohammed and Mr. Kushner stayed up talking together until the small hours of the morning at a ranch in the desert, according to an American official briefed on the trip.Mr. Kechichian, of the King Faisal Center, said the arrests and the confrontation with Iran represented the convergence of two long-term agendas for Prince Mohammed.“Inside he has been able to put his men into positions of influence and he has pushed aside his rivals,” Mr. Kechichian said. “And ever since President Trump’s visit to Riyadh there has been a very consistent policy with the essential coordination of the United States, and Iran is in the bull’s-eye.”Robert Jordan, a former American ambassador to Saudi Arabia who now practices law in the region, said Prince Mohammed’s aggression was “compounded somewhat by what people would call a green light from President Trump.”Mr. Trump has encouraged Saudi Arabia and its allies “to be more forceful against Iran, and to take more charge of their own neighborhood, and they have taken that to heart,” Mr. Jordan said. “They know America will have their back.”Saudi Arabia also said Monday that it would “temporarily” close Yemen’s land, sea and air ports of entry in response to the missile firing, in order to tighten inspections and stop any weapons shipments. It pledged to provide for “the continuation of the entry and exit of humanitarian supplies and crews.”However, the United Nations said that two aid flights scheduled for Monday had not been allowed to depart for Yemen.“We’re trying to see whether we can get our normal access restored,” Farhan Haq, a United Nations spokesman, said at a daily briefing. “We underscored to all parties the need for regular humanitarian access.”The United Nations considers Yemen, the Middle East’s poorest country, one of the world’s biggest humanitarian emergencies. Roughly 17 million people — 60 percent of the population — need food assistance, and seven million are at risk of famine. Nearly 900,000 Yemenis have been sickened by cholera.Saudi Arabia accompanied its accusations against Iran with the announcement that it would pay bounties of up to $30 million for information leading to the capture of 40 Houthi leaders in Yemen.“We fear nothing,” one leader on the list, Mohammad Ali al-Houthi, said in a defiant speech on Monday in the Yemeni capital, Sana.He called the arrests ordered by Prince Mohammed “a coup leading to the throne” and invited any dissident Saudis to take refuge in Yemen. “We tell the citizens and princes in Saudi Arabia that the Yemeni people are opening their arms to you. None will endure injustice.”Yemen’s Houthi-controlled Defense Ministry said over the weekend that its forces had targeted Riyadh’s airport with a long-range missile. Immediately after the firing, the Saudi-led coalition hit Sana with the heaviest barrage of airstrikes in more than a year.With the support of Iran, the Houthis overthrew the internationally recognized government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi in early 2015, and they have controlled much of the country since.While the Houthis have long had loose ties to Iran and have received some support, there has never been proof that they were proxies under the direct command of Tehran, as the Saudis assert, analysts say. But the Saudi intervention appears to have unintentionally brought the Houthis and Iranians closer together, Mr. Jordan, the former ambassador, noted.The Saudi claim about Iran’s responsibility for the missile attack was difficult to evaluate in part because of the long and complicated history of illicit weapons shipments to Yemen.South Yemeni forces acquired Soviet missiles during their civil war with what was then North Yemen before it ended in 1994, and the subsequent national government of Yemen, whose institutions are now under the control of the Houthi faction, had said as long ago as 2002 that it had bought a shipment of Scud missiles from North Korea.State Department cables published by WikiLeaks indicate that Yemen had resumed buying North Korean missiles as recently as 2009. But the Houthi alliance with Iran makes it impossible to rule out the possibility that Tehran provided or procured the missiles, even if they were manufactured in North Korea.Analysts at IHS Jane’s say that it would be difficult for Iran to ship whole missiles to Yemen, but that the missiles could have been acquired from North Korea before the current conflict started.Riyadh has been attacked twice before with missiles from Yemen, in February and March. The Saudi border area, including military bases in the southern city of Jizan, has also been targeted several times.', '‘Justice League’ a Disappointing No. 1 as ‘Wonder’ Surprises - The New York Times“Justice League” was supposed to be the ultimate box office juggernaut.The movie features a murderer’s row of superheroes: Wonder Woman, Batman, Cyborg, the Flash, Superman, Aquaman. Some of the world’s most popular stars — Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Amy Adams — fill out the cast. Joss Whedon, the writer-director behind “The Avengers,” one of the biggest ticket sellers of all time, helped write the screenplay.Instead, “Justice League” collected a disappointing $96 million at North American theaters over the weekend, or 42 percent less than its franchise predecessor, “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” had over its first three days in March 2016. It was enough to top the weekend box office, but analysts had expected “Justice League” to take in at least $110 million based on surveys that measure prerelease audience interest.Most movies would be instant blockbusters with $96 million in opening-weekend ticket sales. But “Justice League” is far from a typical movie. On top of the blue-chip characters it assembles, the film cost at least $400 million to make and market worldwide.

Some of the world’s most popular stars — Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Amy Adams — fill out the cast. Joss Whedon, the writer-director behind “The Avengers,” one of the biggest ticket sellers of all time, helped write the screenplay.Instead, “Justice League” collected a disappointing $96 million at North American theaters over the weekend, or 42 percent less than its franchise predecessor, “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” had over its first three days in March 2016. It was enough to top the weekend box office, but analysts had expected “Justice League” to take in at least $110 million based on surveys that measure prerelease audience interest.Most movies would be instant blockbusters with $96 million in opening-weekend ticket sales. But “Justice League” is far from a typical movie. On top of the blue-chip characters it assembles, the film cost at least $400 million to make and market worldwide.

A group recently formed outside Aleppo is working to find out.The Syrian Center for Anti-Extremist Ideology, which opened on Oct. 28 and is housed inside an area contested by ISIS, aims to be a place where those who have been indoctrinated by the terrorists can be rehabilitated.One hundred students -- composed of former ISIS fighters, sympathizers of the Islamic State who worked in civil society and foreigners who fought for the group before defecting and being detained in liberated areas -- are enrolled in the program.“Everyone has a point of weakness and thinking, from which, we can get into his ideas from a particular side and then remove this extremist and terrorist thought from his brain,” Hussien Nasser, the center’s director, told Fox News.Participants will take part in programs, lectures and seminars covering Islam, psychological and intellectual development, media and entertainment. With the assistance of specialists who chair each session, the center has tailor-made initiatives to figure out what technique works best at de-radicalizing each militant.Many of these men, Nasser said, may reside within prisons for a certain amount of time, only to re-enter society and continue to sow chaos or spread hate. He told Fox News his goal is to "find a solution to these people."A leader instructs prisoners at the Syrian Center for Anti-Extremist Ideology(Photo Courtesy of Abdulfattah Hussien)ISRAEL OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE IN SYRIA AS NEEDEDAlthough the nascent organization is bootstrapping it -- specialists are unpaid and they have no legal framework to formally “graduate” people out of the center -- they will pass along evaluations about each enrolled prisoner to the relevant court.Nasser said ISIS itself poses the biggest threat in terms of reforming militants.“The biggest obstacle is the senior members of ISIS, who planted negative ideas about the concept of moderate Islam and made them criminals under the name of Islam,” Nasser said.Research into whether these de-radicalization efforts have worked is limited. A 2010 Rand Corporation study on the topic pointed out that recidivism rates may not be the best way to judge a program’s success, while another analysis said Saudi Arabia’s programs had only mixed success. The Saudis poured a lot of funds into their efforts, but saw subsequent suicide bombings perpetrated by graduates of the de-radicalization program.Sometimes what happens on the battlefield is the biggest catalyst for deprogramming a militant.A group of participants at the Syrian Center for Anti-Extremist Ideology(Photo Courtesy of Abdulfattah Hussien)TRUMP, PUTIN REPORTEDLY AGREE TO DEFEAT ISIS IN SYRIAIn November 2001, Usama bin Laden gave a speech in which he said, “When people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature, they will like the strong horse” -- the idea being, it’s easier for terrorist groups to recruit new followers when they\'re gaining territory and scoring battlefield victories because people are attracted to winners.“[ISIS] have shown themselves to be failures in their grand aspiration,” William F. Wechsler, senior fellow on national security and counterterrorism at the Middle East Institute, told Fox News. “Everything they said has so far turned out to be not true. That’s the greatest contribution that the U.S. has made to this effort. You’re de-radicalized because your side has lost.”A study from King’s College in London of 15 prison-based de-radicalization programs found these programs work better when an insurgency or extremist movement is losing—rather than in places where civil war is still ongoing.Nasser said he sees some small indications of early progress from his managers in the program.But he added a caveat: “Of course, I cannot confirm the evaluation until a group of prisoners are released and closely monitored to be properly and effectively evaluated."Christopher Carbone is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Hundreds have been killed in what has become a grinding stalemate in Sinai. The militants have expanded their attacks to other parts of Egypt, carrying out deadly bombings of churches to terrorize the Christian minority and deadly gunbattles with security forces.A generation earlier in the 1990s, Egypt faced a campaign of violence by Islamic militants largely based in the south of the country. The militants attacked Christians and security forces and sought to undermine Egypt's economy by striking tourists. It took years but the government was able to crush it with a heavy-handed crackdown that entrenched the long-term power of security agencies in the country. Some of the campaign's militant leaders, from Islamic Jihad and the Gamaa Islamiya, would later be prominent in al-Qaida.Here is a look at some of the deadliest attacks seen in Egypt.HATSEPSUT'S TEMPLE:In November 1997, gunmen opened fire on tourists, killing 62 people, at the Temple of Hatshepsut in the southern city of Luxor, site of many of the country's most dramatic and popular pharaonic monuments. It was the deadliest attack of the 1990s insurgency.___SINAI ATTACKS:In the mid-2000's, newly formed Sinai militant groups carried out a series of bombings against beach resorts. A suicide truck bomber hit a Hilton in Taba on the border with Israel in October 2004, and near simultaneous bombings hit two other Sinai resorts, killing a total of 34 people, mostly Egyptians and Israelis.In July 2005, bombings hit multiple sites including a hotel in Sharm el-Sheikh, the biggest of Egypt's Sinai resorts, killing 88 people. The following April, bombs detonated at several locations in Dahab, killing 23 people.___NEW YEAR'S CHURCH BOMBINGA bomb explodes at the al-Qadeeseen Coptic Christian Church, hitting worshippers as they leave a midnight Mass on New Year's 2011, killing more than 20 people in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria. No suspects have ever been named and the crime is still unsolved.___METROJET FLIGHT 9268A Russian Metrojet passenger airline crashes in Sinai after taking off from Sharm el-Sheikh in October 2015, killing more than 220 people on board, mostly Russian tourists. The Sinai affiliate of the Islamic State group said it blew up the plane with a bomb smuggled on board, and Russia said the aircraft was likely downed by explosives.___ATTACKS ON CHRISTIANSIS-linked militants have carried out multiple attacks on Egypt's Christian minority. In December 2016, a bombing at a chapel adjacent to Egypt's main Coptic Christian cathedral in Cairo killed 30 people and wounded dozens during Sunday Mass.In April 2017: Suicide bombers hit two churches in the coastal city of Alexandria and the Nile Delta city of Tanta during services for Palm Sunday, killing at least 43 people and wounding dozens. The next month, masked militants killed 28 people when they opened fire on a bus packed with Coptic Christians, including children, heading to the remote monastery of St. Samuel the Confessor near the southern town Maghagha.___ATTACKS ON SECURITY FORCESThe IS affiliate has also succeeded in striking heavy and embarrassing blows on Egypt's police and military. In July 2014, gunmen armed with rocket-propelled grenades attacked a post in Egypt's western desert near the Libyan border, killing 21 soldiers. In Sinai only a few months later in October, the IS affiliate struck military checkpoints with surprise attacks that killed more than 30.In July this year, gunmen and a suicide bomber attacked a military checkpoint in northern Sinai, killing 23 soldiers.", 'A Welcome College Diversity Push - The New York TimesThis article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.First, Time magazine named “the silence breakers” — the women speaking out against sexual harassment and assault — as 2017’s Person of the Year. It’s an excellent choice. Decades from now, I expect we will look back on this year as a turning point on this issue. And unlike many potential 2017 turning points, this one is welcome.Still, don’t forget the terrible price many women pay for speaking up: “Nearly all of the people Time interviewed about their experiences expressed a crushing fear of what would happen to them personally, to their families or to their jobs if they spoke up.”Related: Lauren Greene, a former staff member to Blake Farenthold, a Texas congressman, has suffered both personally and professionally after accusing Farenthold of sexual harassment. Rachael Bade of Politico reported the details this week, and they’re worth reading.In The Times, Thomas Chatterton Williams writes that too many women — often poor and of color — are prevented from telling their stories of harassment and assault.Unfairness in higher ed. This country’s colleges are not the meritocracies they claim to be. Top public and private colleges — as measured by resources, graduation rates or just about anything else — still disproportionately enroll affluent students. The colleges do so even though many highly qualified low- and middle-income students exist, as I’ve written before.At long last, however, there is now a pretty serious push to make colleges more economically diverse. Part of that push is called the American Talent Initiative, backed by Michael Bloomberg, and this morning it’s announcing a significant expansion.Eighteen more colleges have joined the initiative, bringing the total to 86. Together, they are pledging to increase the number of lower-income students at top colleges by 50,000 (or more than 10 percent) by 2025.The new members include the University of Delaware, Haverford, Case Western and five University of California campuses. I was pleased to see both the University of Wisconsin (one of the country’s least economically diverse public universities) and Washington & Lee University (one of the least diverse private colleges) on the list. Existing members of the initiative include 12 flagship state universities, the entire Ivy League, Stanford, Caltech and N.Y.U.As part of the announcement, six colleges also publicly announced their own goals for increasing diversity — which matters, because it means they can be held accountable.Elizabethtown College, in central Pennsylvania, plans to enroll more transfer students, especially from local community colleges. “We don’t get as many transfers from them as we should,” Carl Strikwerda, Elizabethtown’s president, told me.The University of Washington, in Seattle, has vowed to reduce the gap in its six-year graduation rate for low-income students (79 percent) and other students (82 percent). Ana Mari Cauce, the university president, pointed out that changes at public colleges are especially important because of their large size. “We do things at scale,” she said.Unfortunately, many public colleges have become less economically diverse in recent years, because state legislators have cut their budgets. It’s terribly counterproductive, given the large economic returns that education has for both individuals and society. (If you doubt that last point, I encourage you to read more on the topic.)But stingy legislators aren’t the only problem. College leaders also have failed to live up to their own rhetoric on this issue. I hope that is starting to change.Jerusalem.

The entire Saudi paradox was distilled into that cartoon: The country produces, sponsors, shelters and feeds the Islamism that threatens its foundations and its future.How could this be? One has to go back nearly three centuries to begin to answer this question. Around 1744, a tribal chieftain, Muhammad ibn Saud, formed an alliance with an ultraconservative preacher named Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and created the first monarchical state on the Arabian Peninsula. On the one hand, there was the Saud family, governing the country by right of blood and succession; on the other, there was Wahhabism, an ultra-puritanical and extreme version of Islam it called the original Islam. A family and a clergy — the whole welded together over the decades as much by oil revenues as by the legitimacy deriving from proximity to Islam’s holiest sites.But Wahhabism is also, of course, one of the matrices of global jihadism today: an ideological and financial source of the Islamists’ power and their constellation of fundamentalist mosques, television networks dedicated to sermonizing, and various political parties throughout the Muslim world. Saudi Arabia feeds the hand that is killing it, little by little, and other countries as well.It took the West being heavily hit by Islamist terrorism for it to appreciate fully the measure of this menace, long camouflaged. Indeed, even as Saudi leaders were shaking hands and smiling at their Western counterparts, they were hosting preachers advocating jihad to the hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Mecca for the annual pilgrimage. Today, everyone sees through the facade better.Reform in Saudi Arabia now seems necessary — and yet, at the same time, impossible. How will the royal family manage to reject the clergy’s support, stop the financing of fundamentalist networks and bring about nothing short of several revolutions regarding social rights? The kingdom’s stability is at stake and, as a consequence, that of the entire region, too.The appearance of the man known as the “iron prince” — Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old heir to the throne — suggests that there may be a solution to the Saudi problem. Young, fiery, seen as a reformer, the crown prince has been making a splash since his father placed him at the forefront of the political scene about two years ago. He is proposing, for example, another kind of economic model than the one, built around oil and gas, that prevails today, and has announced development megaprojects and plans to open up the country to tourism unconditionally.The prince, nicknamed “M.B.S.,” even seems willing to try the unthinkable: granting women the right to drive or go to sport stadiums, eventually reopening cinemas and, above all, putting pressure on the clergy and announcing the review and certification of the great canons of Muslim orthodoxy, including the hadiths, the collection of the Prophet Muhammad’s sayings.All this is a risky proposition. What is happening in Saudi Arabia today, especially considering the recent purges against the old guard, resembles both a palace revolution and a religious upheaval. In addition, these changes coincide with the Saudi government’s renewed warnings about the Iranian menace and its rapprochement with Israel. What kind of revolutionary is this prince? Some see in him instead a man guided by an American hand, commissioned to clean up the region.Whatever the real effect of these changes in Saudi Arabia, they already are being felt elsewhere. If this country, the motherland of fatwas, undertakes reforms, Islamists throughout the world will have to follow suit or risk winding up on the wrong side of orthodoxy.In Algeria, for example, the hard-liners’ discomfort is subtly palpable. On social media, the conspiracy theory seems to prevail: M.B.S.’s stunt is seen as the product of an American injunction. But conservative newspapers and Islamist editorial writers — generally keen on all matters Saudi and quick to comment on any slight against Islam — are mostly quiet this time, or timid in their defense of Wahhabism. In mosques as well, silence dominates.Islamists in Algeria belong to one of two camps. One, supposedly ancestral and pure, claims kinship with Saudi Arabia and the Fatwa Valley. It is troubled by M.B.S.’s reforms, fearing they may signal an end to its financing and a blow to its legitimacy.The other camp is of the Muslim Brotherhood stripe and close to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey; the Islamist political parties it has formed are tolerated by the Algerian government. But its members, too, are worried: If Saudi Arabia reforms, they will lose their mantle of tolerant Islamists and their position on Algeria’s political chessboard. The Saudi crown prince, by casting himself as more moderate than moderates elsewhere, is pulling the rug from under their feet.And so all manner of Islamists are feeling the anxiety of being orphaned. The moderate camp, blindsided, may try to play catch-up with the prince. But the fundamentalist camp, bereft of its familiar markers, may turn against the Saudi kingdom to claim a new kind of legitimacy — and wage a sort of holy war against the holy land.', 'Iraq Is Not Iran’s Puppet - The New York TimesBEIRUT, Lebanon — Iraq is, once again, deeply embroiled in crisis. For three years, the central government in Baghdad and the Kurdish region fought together to oust the Islamic State. Now, following the Sept. 25 referendum on independence for the region, they are pointing their guns at each other.The dynamics in Iraq are far from simple, with intra-Kurdish rivalries; ethnic, sectarian and political divisions in Baghdad; and a war against the Islamic State barely in the rearview mirror. And yet too many people in Washington and elsewhere seem myopically focused on just one factor: Iran, which they view as controlling and dominating the situation in Iraq in pursuit of an ambitious, expansionist foreign policy. That’s far from the full story.Since coming to power in 2014, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq has worked to push back against Iranian hegemony. Although he is (like the Iranian government) Shiite, he professes to be first and foremost an Iraqi nationalist. And he is certainly not an adherent of the Iranian government’s revolutionary ideology.This doesn’t make Mr. Abadi unique. Most Iraqi Shiites likewise don’t want to see their country become Tehran’s puppet. The populist Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr now openly opposes Iranian dominance. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the Iraqi who is the global spiritual leader of all Shiites, has criticized Tehran’s interference, and in September, he refused to meet with a top Iranian cleric who had been dispatched by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Even the Popular Mobilization Forces, a constellation of some 60 Shiite-dominated paramilitary groups in Iraq, are divided: Some are aligned with Iran, others oppose it.To balance Iranian influence, Mr. Abadi has sought to build alliances with other local, regional and international players. He has visited Saudi Arabia, Iran’s regional nemesis, twice in recent months and has established strong ties with Washington.The prime minister has also become increasingly popular with Iraq’s Sunnis, who are wary of Iran’s deep penetration into the Iraqi state since 2003 and now see Mr. Abadi as a conciliatory figure and a safeguard against too much Iranian influence.The evolution of the fight against the Islamic State has revealed this balancing act. When the Islamic State swept across Iraq in the summer of 2014, Iran came to the rescue, quickly providing material and tactical support. Later, when Iraqi forces were advancing against the Islamic State, Mr. Abadi invited a United States-led coalition to join the fight — despite strong Iranian objections. And in more recent battles, Mr. Abadi has kept Iranian proxies back from the front lines.This is some of the context that too many in Washington are ignoring right now as they view the tension between Baghdad and the Kurds as one piece in an Iranian gambit for control.Iran is, of course, involved in its neighbor’s politics and battles. In fact, Iran is the strongest foreign actor in Iraq. And when it comes to Iraq, Tehran is always one step ahead of Washington and its allies because its relationships with groups from different sects and ethnicities give it a better understanding of the political terrain.For instance, while American officials were left scrambling after the Kurdish Regional Government declined to postpone the referendum, Iran knew better — and was better prepared for the immediate aftermath of the vote. Iran is successful because it relies on powerful local allies, including friendly Shiite paramilitaries within the Popular Mobilization Forces. It also has a long-running relationship with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, one of the leading Kurdish parties.This doesn’t translate to a desire to destroy Iraq. Iran, remembering the deadly war of the 1980s, wants to ensure that Iraq is not powerful. But its interests also include relative stability and a secure border. It can’t have the Islamic State too close; the Iraqi collapse in 2014 alarmed Tehran.The fear in Washington has been the opposite: that Iran’s activities in Iraq are malign and destabilizing.Since 2003, officials in Washington keep getting Iran wrong. Many are understandably still scarred by the 1979 hostage crisis or Iranian-supported Iraqi militias killing American soldiers in 2003. Or they are concerned about Iranian threats to Israel. When it comes to Iran in Iraq, emotion fogs reality, limiting understanding in Washington. Yet for Iran, when it comes to the United States in the Middle East, pragmatism guides policy, translating to more successes.For the Iraqi government, Iran is a foreign actor just like the United States is. Iraqi leaders view Iranian officials in their country — including Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’ elite Quds Force — as international military advises, just as they view American military advisers. Both are first looking out for their country’s national interests. The Iraqi government does not assign any ethical or moral superiority to one over the other, and it still needs both.To finally get Iraq right, the United States must move past its obsessive denial based on a fear of Iranian influence, recognize that Tehran’s abilities are limited and appreciate the fine line that the government in Baghdad has to walk. Until then, the Iranophobes will be right about one thing: Iran is the smarter player in the region.', '5 Shows to See if You’re in New York in November - The New York TimesNew Yorkers are infamous for regarding their city as the center of the universe and, on especially self-satisfied days, as the only place to be. This city’s theater artists, though, know that big things happen in small and out-of-the-way places. Consider some of the new productions opening this month.Their settings, which embrace both real and unreal estate, include a quaint little Scottish village that exists beyond the borders of time, a tiny Israeli desert town most notable for its lack of distinguishing features, an American high school soccer field and most of the vast area classified as Latin America. And, oh yes, space — as in the cosmos, where meteors fly.Indisputable proof that boring (or at least bored) people can be terrifically exciting company, this beautiful and surprising musical from the composer David Yazbek and the playwright Itamar Moses takes place in a terminally sleepy provincial corner of Israel. But then a touring Egyptian band (mistakenly) winds up there, and new life blooms, shyly and unexpectedly, beneath desert skies. A sold-out hit for the Atlantic Theater Company in the spring, this wide-awake sleeper arrives on Broadway with most of its original team intact — including its inspired director, David Cromer, and a cast led by Tony Shalhoub and the incomparable Katrina Lenk.Tickets: thebandsvisitmusical.comPerhaps the ultimate “escape from New York” fantasy, this 1947 Lerner and Loewe musical drops two jaded Manhattanites into a mirage of a Scottish town that has never been tainted by urban bustle and stress. City Center has come up with a dream team to give life to this dream location. Its director and choreographer is Christopher Wheeldon, who triumphed with the stage version of “An American in Paris,” and the cast includes Kelli O’Hara, Patrick Wilson and the virtuosic dancer Robert Fairchild (who can act, too). Like the town of its title, this deluxe concert staging of “Brigadoon” will materialize only briefly, from Nov. 15 to 19, to be exact.Tickets: nycitycenter.orgFirst seen in a Playwrights Realm production last year, Sarah DeLappe’s high-voltage drama of young women coming of age on AstroTurf is being remounted at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center. If you missed “The Wolves” during its previous incarnations, don’t make the mistake of doing so again. With a fresh, all-female ensemble that brims with the sap of life under the direction of Lila Neugebauer, it remains one of the most exciting debuts by an American playwright in years.Tickets: lct.orgThe human tornado known as John Leguizamo cuts a swirling — and often hilarious — swath through assorted countries and centuries to consider the origins and evolution of the Hispanic populations of the Americas. Those who saw this one-man show at the Public Theater in the spring may have been surprised by the antic Mr. Leguizamo’s latest onstage alter ego, that of a paternal, if unorthodox, professor who is helping his son prepare a class project. This relatively respectable persona does not, repeat not, mean the creator of such angry, young Latino pieces as “Mambo Mouth” and “Freak” has altogether grown up. Thank the Lord for that. Mr. Leguizamo returns to Broadway at Studio 54, an appropriate venue for a hyperkinetic soul who still has all the right moves.Tickets: latinhistorybroadway.comThe polymathic Steve Martin, last represented on Broadway by the banjo-plucking “Bright Star,” is back as the author of a cosmic domestic comedy set in Ojai, Calif. — and the heavens above. Directed by Jerry Zaks, this tale of two couples at war (shades of “God of Carnage”) is illuminated by the astral fireworks of its title, not to mention a white-hot star in the person of Amy Schumer, in her Broadway debut. The cast also includes Keegan-Michael Key, Jeremy Shamos and the scene-stealing Laura Benanti, who has become this country’s foremost impersonator of its first lady, Melania Trump.Tickets: meteoronbroadway.com', 'The Most Riveting Host in Late Night (and the Most Overlooked) - The New York TimesIn September, Tom Cruise stepped into a car with Conan O’Brien and, with his characteristic exuberance, exclaimed that he was ready to sing karaoke or talk comedy. Mr. O’Brien waved away those ideas. “My thing, Tom, is take it back to basics,” he said, before describing his plan: “Two guys, just driving.”What followed was not a spoof of James Corden’s signature “Carpool Karaoke” but something delightfully weirder than that. This 11-minute video began as cringe-comedy performance art, with Mr. Cruise bored and baffled, and Mr. O’Brien, quietly driving, as a hostile, frighteningly intense version of himself. Then the narrative turned into a kind of thriller as the hero, Mr. Cruise, in his best comic role since “Tropic Thunder,” slowly realized he was trapped with a maniac and needed to take desperate measures. It was the funniest bit on late night I had seen all year.Among the scrum of late-night hosts, Conan O’Brien — who is set to shoot his TBS show, “Conan,” at the Apollo Theater beginning Monday as part of the New York Comedy Festival — is not earning the highest ratings or generating the most talk. But his show has become more distinctive than ever, doubling down on comedy for comedy’s sake. Now that New York magazine has called Jimmy Kimmel the new Walter Cronkite, and Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert pursue viral moments with games or political diatribes, Conan O’Brien suddenly seems like not only the sole host in the time slot truly desperate to make you laugh, but also the most willing to take artistic risks.Maybe he really is just going back to basics. It’s easy to take Mr. O’Brien’s gift for refined silliness for granted, since he has been doing the job for nearly a quarter century. His show still looks a bit like what Johnny Carson did for decades: emerge from a curtain to big applause, deliver a topical monologue, then move to a desk, banter with a sidekick, do a comedy bit and talk to guests.Instead of shying from appearing old-fashioned, Mr. O’Brien now uses that image, poking fun at himself, which was part of the joke of the Tom Cruise bit, but also earnestly embracing his status as the éminence grise of late night. When his sidekick, Andy Richter, ad-libbed a line a few weeks ago that referenced Jack Benny, Mr. O’Brien laughed, adding, “Could you send everyone a letter telling them who that is?” After a break, he brought up Benny again, recommending him to the audience, surely the only plug that this comedy legend has received on late night in a long while.In his first years on TBS, Mr. O’Brien still seemed haunted by losing “The Tonight Show,” but his series now has the pleasing eccentricity of someone who doesn’t care about ratings or expectations.In the past two weeks, he has brought on weirdo characters like Butterscotch, part of a long tradition of creepy clowns, and a guy doing a Dracula impression who can’t stop making bad puns (“I don’t want to sound like your mummy but …”), a bit that spun out unexpectedly into a story of addiction that led this bad joker to attend the Lestat Institute for Word Therapy. The fake institute, complete with serious-looking people in white lab coats, evoked Albert Brooks’s classic sendups of the conventions of comedy.Just because the premises of these sketches are tethered to a tradition doesn’t mean they aren’t peculiar. Mr. O’Brien’s brand of silliness has always been delightfully, often gruesomely askew. Recently, he began a sketch by asking strangers what they thought about the news that Sears would no longer be carrying Whirlpool appliances. But this man-on-the-street premise was only the setup, because after a few people expressed normal curiosity or indifference, one man appeared stunned, immediately called his family, went home and buried himself alive while they watched. The video ended in another interview with a person showing mild interest in the news, but in the background, the family looked down on the grave and set it aflame.While some jokes are connected to the calendar, like the clown for Halloween, many of them are evergreen. A punch line about the daily goings-on in Washington can get easy laughs from like-minded viewers. But they won’t age well, and Mr. O’Brien, generally speaking, aims for jokes that depend less on the news cycle than his competitors do.This even extends to how Mr. O’Brien handles politics. While he does an ordinary joke or two about President Trump every night, he also produced one of the most truly daring episodes of political comedy this year, with a September show shot entirely in Israel and the Palestinian territories, one of his many episode-long forays into other cities. Mr. O’Brien floated in the Dead Sea, engaged in some terrible haggling with street vendors and delivered a minute-long history of the area that covered thousands of years.Much of the special was simply Mr. O’Brien unscripted, making a connection with game strangers and turning that into an amusing scene. But he didn’t only stay light. When he traveled to the West Bank barrier, he bumped into pro-Palestinian activists, who criticized Zionism, describing a Palestinian girl killed by an Israeli settler. He spent most of this awkward but compelling exchange listening, without defensiveness, and then posted the entire 24-minute segment  online. Inevitably, his show was criticized for bias, but wading into this dispute, even clumsily, displayed an admirable willingness to take risks.Earlier this year, there were rumors that “Conan” was shifting to a weekly format, and Lord knows, after being a daily talk-show host since 1993, he has earned the right to a slower schedule. But here’s hoping he sticks around, because more than anyone else on air, he is a reminder that talk-show hosting is an art form deserving respect. The increasing politicization of late-night comedy has been great for ratings, and has helped certain hosts find their voices, but it’s worth examining if it comes at a cost. Comedy doesn’t need to serve a political end to be important.', "CAIRO – Egypt was hit by its deadliest ever militant attack on Friday, when gunmen opened fire and set off explosives at a mosque in the northern Sinai Peninsula, killing more than 200 people.Egypt has been battling an insurgency in the Sinai led by an affiliate of the Islamic State group that intensified after the military's 2013 ouster of the Muslim Brotherhood from power. Hundreds have been killed in what has become a grinding stalemate in Sinai. The militants have expanded their attacks to other parts of Egypt, carrying out deadly bombings of churches to terrorize the Christian minority and deadly gunbattles with security forces.A generation earlier in the 1990s, Egypt faced a campaign of violence by Islamic militants largely based in the south of the country. The militants attacked Christians and security forces and sought to undermine Egypt's economy by striking tourists. It took years but the government was able to crush it with a heavy-handed crackdown that entrenched the long-term power of security agencies in the country. Some of the campaign's militant leaders, from Islamic Jihad and the Gamaa Islamiya, would later be prominent in al-Qaida.Here is a look at some of the deadliest attacks seen in Egypt.HATSEPSUT'S TEMPLE:In November 1997, gunmen opened fire on tourists, killing 62 people, at the Temple of Hatshepsut in the southern city of Luxor, site of many of the country's most dramatic and popular pharaonic monuments. It was the deadliest attack of the 1990s insurgency.___SINAI ATTACKS:In the mid-2000's, newly formed Sinai militant groups carried out a series of bombings against beach resorts. A suicide truck bomber hit a Hilton in Taba on the border with Israel in October 2004, and near simultaneous bombings hit two other Sinai resorts, killing a total of 34 people, mostly Egyptians and Israelis.In July 2005, bombings hit multiple sites including a hotel in Sharm el-Sheikh, the biggest of Egypt's Sinai resorts, killing 88 people. The following April, bombs detonated at several locations in Dahab, killing 23 people.___NEW YEAR'S CHURCH BOMBINGA bomb explodes at the al-Qadeeseen Coptic Christian Church, hitting worshippers as they leave a midnight Mass on New Year's 2011, killing more than 20 people in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria. No suspects have ever been named and the crime is still unsolved.___METROJET FLIGHT 9268A Russian Metrojet passenger airline crashes in Sinai after taking off from Sharm el-Sheikh in October 2015, killing more than 220 people on board, mostly Russian tourists. The Sinai affiliate of the Islamic State group said it blew up the plane with a bomb smuggled on board, and Russia said the aircraft was likely downed by explosives.___ATTACKS ON CHRISTIANSIS-linked militants have carried out multiple attacks on Egypt's Christian minority. In December 2016, a bombing at a chapel adjacent to Egypt's main Coptic Christian cathedral in Cairo killed 30 people and wounded dozens during Sunday Mass.In April 2017: Suicide bombers hit two churches in the coastal city of Alexandria and the Nile Delta city of Tanta during services for Palm Sunday, killing at least 43 people and wounding dozens. The next month, masked militants killed 28 people when they opened fire on a bus packed with Coptic Christians, including children, heading to the remote monastery of St. Samuel the Confessor near the southern town Maghagha.___ATTACKS ON SECURITY FORCESThe IS affiliate has also succeeded in striking heavy and embarrassing blows on Egypt's police and military. In July 2014, gunmen armed with rocket-propelled grenades attacked a post in Egypt's western desert near the Libyan border, killing 21 soldiers. In Sinai only a few months later in October, the IS affiliate struck military checkpoints with surprise attacks that killed more than 30.In July this year, gunmen and a suicide bomber attacked a military checkpoint in northern Sinai, killing 23 soldiers.", 'On Health, de Blasio Focuses on Crises and Inequality - The New York TimesFour years ago, Bill de Blasio, then the city’s public advocate and a mere mayoral hopeful, took part in a rally in Midtown Manhattan to protest the imminent closing of Long Island College Hospital.Surrounded by dozens of singing and cheering hospital workers, he chanted “No Hospital, No Peace,” and helped block the entrance to the offices of the chancellor of the State University of New York. The police arrested Mr. de Blasio and charged him with disorderly conduct.Mr. de Blasio got the attention he wanted — for a cause, and for himself.In his “Tale of Two Cities” campaign theme, the fight over the storied but troubled hospital in Brooklyn was a potent symbol of which city Mr. de Blasio stood behind. He proclaimed solidarity with the powerful health care workers union 1199 S.E.I.U., and promised voters outside Manhattan that he would fight for dying community hospitals.Four years later, Long Island College Hospital is long gone. In its place is River Park, an upscale condo and townhouse development where new apartments are priced from about $2.55 million to more than $6 million.For critics of the mayor, and even some supporters of his policy vision, the fight over the hospital smacked of a cynical gambit and a portent of how politics could pre-empt serious policy.But when fears of Ebola gripped the city during his first year in office, Mr. de Blasio employed similar theatrics to calm fears — hugging an Ebola patient and eating at a restaurant where that man had dined — and he used his pulpit to support the broader efforts by medical workers to combat the deadly virus.In the mayor’s first term, pedestrian political calculations and battles with Albany have tainted some of his efforts on issues related to public health. But in general, the bigger and more serious the crisis, the better the results.He was a steady hand during the Ebola pandemic fear, and the city’s health agencies have done an effective job educating the public about the Zika virus as it spread across South America and the Caribbean.It is difficult to assess how much or how quickly Mr. de Blasio, or most mayors for that matter, has had an effect on the health of the city. Mr. de Blasio’s predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, spent an unusual amount of capital to combat obesity and smoking.And even though Mr. de Blasio made a rhetorical sport of denigrating all things related to Mr. Bloomberg, he has chosen to keep and expand on some of his predecessor’s most important public health initiatives, including the fight against tobacco and pushing for calorie labeling at restaurants.Judging Mr. de Blasio’s record is made more difficult because one of his main goals — addressing inequality in health care — requires multiagency cooperation and the programs can take years to show results.There is also no simple metric to measure the physical well being of the city’s residents over only four years, but the Health Department’s annual summary of vital statistics tracks some key indicators, including life expectancy, infant mortality and the leading causes of death.Most notably, death rates attributed to three of the leading causes of death in the city — heart disease, cancer and influenza/pneumonia — have continued to fall during the de Blasio administration, extending the decline seen under the Bloomberg administration, when life expectancy in the city increased by three years.Still, city officials said that wide disparities remain in the health of New Yorkers based on income, race and where they live.The infant mortality rate for non-Hispanic blacks was three times higher than non-Hispanic whites, and the rate for Puerto Rican New Yorkers was 2.3 times higher, according to the data.The de Blasio administration has started a number of initiatives to fight these disparities, including using city property for primary care clinics to share space with community-based organizations focused on health.One of the mayor’s most important initiatives has come in response to a problem that cities and towns across the country are dealing with: opioid addiction. The other, ThriveNYC — an effort to help New Yorkers with issues related to mental health — is personal; the mayor’s wife, Chirlane McCray, who is leading the program, has spoken about her parents’ depression and the drug use of her daughter, Chiara.More than 170,000 calls, texts and chats have flowed into a confidential mental health hotline since it was established last October, forcing the Health Department to expand its staff.Like in much of the country, opioid addiction and overdose deaths are on the rise in the city. The mayor, again with Ms. McCray playing a central role, announced a $38 million initiative to reduce opioid deaths by 35 percent over the next five years.Fighting the opioid crisis also requires close coordination with the police. This year, the mayor announced that every opioid overdose — fatal and nonfatal — would be investigated, dedicating 84 police officers to this task.But Mr. de Blasio has had a harder time fulfilling his campaign promises related to health — essentially a single-topic platform on the fate of community hospitals, and one in particular, Long Island College Hospital.“It was a clearly a key part of his campaign and it played a major role in separating him from the other candidates,” said James R. Tallon Jr., who was president of the United Hospital Fund of New York before retiring in August.It was a fight he lost, and perhaps learned from.Last year, when Mount Sinai Beth Israel, an 825-bed hospital that has served downtown Manhattan for more than 125 years, announced that it was closing its building and replacing it with a smaller one, City Hall was largely silent. It seemed resigned that there was little the administration could do to change the reality of the economic picture facing hospitals: Beth Israel was one of 19 hospitals in the city that have either closed or overhauled how they operate since 2000.Nonetheless, Mr. de Blasio has vowed to protect all of the city’s 11 hospitals managed by the Health + Hospitals Corporation.“No matter the odds, the mayor will always fight when it comes to New Yorkers’ health care,” said Olivia Lapeyrolerie, a spokeswoman for the mayor, referring to Long Island College Hospital and hospitals across the city.City Hall has been working to restructure the organization and offered an infusion of $2 billion in subsidies for the public hospital system that, according to a 2016 report by the mayor’s office, was “on the edge of a financial cliff.”“Unlike what has happened in other cities, Health + Hospitals will remain a vibrant public system — it is not for sale and the city will not abandon it,” according to the 55-page report.But the financial stability of the city’s hospitals are vulnerable to forces far beyond the control of City Hall. Specifically, it is hard to predict how proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act being debated in Washington will affect the city.For example, the increase in the number of people with Medicaid coverage under the health law would seem to be a boon to city hospitals, since they are required to treat anyone regardless of whether or not they have insurance. But the report found that once people gained insurance and more health care choices, many chose not to go to public hospitals. Still, public hospitals are the only options for the million New Yorkers who have no insurance, many of them undocumented immigrants. When treating those patients, the hospitals pick up the cost.Dr. Herminia Palacio, the deputy mayor for Health and Human Services, said that Mr. de Blasio subscribes to the theory that when it comes to public health, a holistic approach is necessary.The point, she said, is that many aspects of the mayor’s agenda — from affordable housing to education — play a role in public health. She quoted Dr. Rudolf Virchow, a 19th century German doctor, for providing the guiding vision on City Hall’s approach.“Medicine is a social science,” she said. “And politics is nothing but medicine on a large scale.”Under the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the department has created the Center for Health Equity, which focuses attention on certain neighborhoods deprived of sufficient resources and attention. Just like there are high-crime areas in the city, there are also sections — like parts of North and South Brooklyn and Harlem — that are high-disease areas. And similar to the police using CompStat data to develop strategies for reducing crime in certain areas, the city can use its extensive health data to push interagency health initiatives in specific areas.To further the goal, the city is revitalizing underutilized Health Department buildings in some neighborhoods to provide more direct health services and to create partnerships between public hospital clinical services and community-based organizations. The initiative expands on the already robust network of district public health offices, providing a variety of services under one roof. In April, the department announced the creation of three Neighborhood Action Health Centers in East Harlem, Brownsville, Brooklyn, and Tremont in the Bronx.On a tour of a health center in East Harlem, it was evident how grouped together services could provide vital resources to a neighborhood in desperate need of them.Mac Levine, who runs a nonprofit that uses after-school programs to get children in high-crime neighborhoods focused on activities like urban gardening, had been struggling to find space for her headquarters for eight years.Since moving into the Harlem building, she said, the group has doubled the number of volunteers to 1,000, and the number of children it serves has increased to 5,000 from 2,700.Her office is next door to a group that is working to improve the nutrition for new and expectant mothers. And that office is next to the Association to Benefit Children, which provides mental health support to young children among other services. In September, when a child was shot and killed a block from the center, the organization sent out its rapid response team to provide counseling, but it also is now present in the neighborhood so people can just walk in and get help.Dr. Mary T. Bassett, the commissioner of the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene since January 2014, said that she and the mayor shared the same vision for trying to improve the health outcomes for the city’s poorest residents.“We both agreed wholeheartedly that inequality was driving poor health outcomes, disproportionally affecting communities of color,” she said. “I knew he wanted someone with a vision, and he wanted bold steps to move his progressive agenda.”But Mr. de Blasio’s first four years will likely be remembered for how the city handled events beyond his or anyone’s control.When a doctor, Craig Spencer, returned to New York from West Africa and tested positive for Ebola in 2014, hysteria threatened to outpace reason.Around the same time, Kaci Hickox was ordered by Gov. Chris Christie to be held in a quarantine tent in New Jersey for three days after she returned from working as a nurse in Sierra Leone, even though she never tested positive for the virus. She was then released on the condition she return to her home in Maine — which also sought to quarantine her.Dr. Spencer, by contrast, had traveled around the city before he was diagnosed with having the virus.Mr. de Blasio and Dr. Bassett made it a point to eat at the Meatball Shop, where Dr. Spencer had dined. And when he was finally released from the hospital, the mayor was the first to offer him a hug.He also championed the other medical workers who went to Africa to combat the virus at a time when many were being stigmatized when they returned home.“My tenure as commissioner has been dominated by microbes,” Dr. Bassett said. “In each challenge, whether it was Ebola, Legionnaires’ disease, or Zika, the mayor has shown unwavering support for public health.”', 'Michael Flynn, Kathryn Steinle, Jim Nabors: Your Friday Briefing - The New York Times (Want to get this briefing by email?

Forbidden from marrying her, the nobleman disguised himself and went to work for the baker, creating a new bread to impress the woman, made with butter, eggs and candied fruit. The bread was such a hit at court, a new dessert was named in its honor — pan del Ton — and the nobleman was allowed to marry the daughter.Five hundred years later, the boxed version of panettone became widely available. Homemade panettone is notoriously difficult: Butter a couple of degrees too warm can turn the dough to mush.But the proof of the pudding is in the eating.“It melts in your mouth and it’s suddenly gone,” one baker told The Times. “And then you want to eat more.”Remy Tumin contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning.

(Here’s video and a transcript of his speech.)Hours later, Representative Trent Franks, Republican of Arizona, also resigned, becoming the third member of Congress this week to step down over claims of impropriety. (Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat, quit on Tuesday.)In taking a firm stand, Democrats appear determined to seize the moral high ground. But some say the party risks shooting itself in the foot: “I think there’s a sense of hyper political correctness, and that we’re holier-than-thou,” a former aide to Mr. Franken said.• Separately, the conductor James Levine called accusations that he sexually abused several men decades ago “unfounded.”• Armed with sprinklers and garden hoses, residents fought to save their homes as wildfires continued to scorch the hills in and around Los Angeles.More than 200,000 people had to evacuate on Thursday, and the main coastal freeway north of the city was closed.

They favored the now common formula of prioritizing touring over selling records, and were first to encourage fans to make and trade concert recordings.In 2015, the remaining members reunited for “Fare Thee Well” shows. The average ticket price for some of them was $938.Charles McDermid contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning.

Less common is for museum directors themselves to take political positions.But Ms. Raicovich, 44, almost three years into her tenure at the Queens Museum, has been notably outspoken on various hot-button topics, particularly immigration and DACA. It’s an issue that hits close to home. Five percent of her staff members are DACA recipients, or Dreamers, as they are known, and the museum is operating in a borough where about 91,000 undocumented immigrants are eligible for DACA, the highest of New York City’s five boroughs.National politics is sensitive territory that arts organizations all over the country are trying to navigate during this polarized era, and some are asking whether it is appropriate for museum directors to also be public advocates.“It’s hard to put one’s own politics aside when we represent public institutions that welcome all viewpoints,” said Anne Pasternak, the director of the Brooklyn Museum. “This is a moment when cultural leaders are asking themselves, do I want to be on the right side of history?”Traditionally, museum directors have remained behind the scenes, allowing the art they show to speak for itself. But increasingly they have been forced to defend and — in two recent cases, at the Guggenheim and the Louvre — remove controversial exhibitions. Many see the withdrawal of artwork as a troubling development for cultural institutions that are supposed to champion free expression.When the Trump era of fast-moving political developments headed toward cultural institutions this year — specifically the president’s proposed defunding of the National Endowment for the Arts — at least two museum directors in New York felt compelled to jump into the fray.Some museums have also responded by quickly staging politically relevant exhibitions. To protest Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration, the Museum of Modern Art in February rehung part of its permanent collection with works by artists from some of the majority-Muslim nations whose citizens were blocked from entering the United States. And the Brooklyn Museum organized its recent show, “The Legacy of Lynching: Confronting Racial Terror in America,” in just five weeks.But in Queens, where 165 different languages are spoken, Ms. Raicovich seems to be charting her own community-focused path, with an emphasis on making the museum a safe haven for the borough’s large immigrant population.“I take my leadership very seriously — not just in a physical and managerial sense,” Ms. Raicovich said in a recent interview at her museum office. “Care and equity has to be part of what I bring to my position.“This isn’t an abstraction; this is real,” she added. “It’s people that I work with every day. This museum is interacting with immigrants.”On Mr. Trump’s Inauguration Day in January, the Queens Museum closed its galleries in solidarity with an art strike called by hundreds of artists — including Cindy Sherman, Richard Serra and Louise Lawler — to combat, as the organizers put, it “the normalization of Trumpism — a toxic mix of white supremacy, misogyny, xenophobia, militarism, and oligarchic rule.” The museum invited the community to come make protest posters, buttons and banners (materials provided for free).And, since some immigrant residents have been newly wary of going out in public — Ms. Raicovich said attendance noticeably dropped after the election — the museum has been holding events in people’s homes and on their blocks. “Xenophobia is not a new thing,” Ms. Raicovich said. “Our work has just intensified.”A politically outspoken museum director could run the risk of alienating trustees, donors and potential future employers, who may disagree with her views or deem such advocacy inappropriate. But so far, the Queens Museum board has supported Ms. Raicovich. “This is an engaged time, and she is an engaged leader who has placed values of difference and multiplicity at the center of her leadership,” Mark J. Coleman, the museum’s chairman, said.Artists also say they appreciate Ms. Raicovich’s bold stances. “Having a young director brave enough to talk about issues that are directly affecting Americans — especially people born Dreamers — is so worthy,” said the conceptual visual artist Mel Chin, who will have a retrospective at the museum in April. “Someone in a position to speak out on behalf of people who don’t have voices is what it’s all about.”To help New York’s cultural institutions through this thicket, the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs and the Ford Foundation last spring invited arts leaders to a discussion with legal experts on what is permissible for nonprofits in lobbying and political activity. Nonprofit laws bar institutions from engaging in electoral politics and holding political fund-raisers, a hornet’s nest the Queens Museum ran into this past summer when it appeared to cancel and then reinstate an Israel-sponsored event after accusations of anti-Semitism.Two city officials in August called for Ms. Raicovich’s removal, and one of them, Councilman Rory I. Lancman, said in an interview this month that he is still awaiting the results of the museum’s investigation into the matter.“The museum discriminated against a Jewish organization in a way that I think makes it impossible for her to serve as the head of the museum,” he said. “I have given the board of the museum the opportunity to conduct a thorough investigation and present me with facts showing me she’s not at fault, and she should not be removed, but they haven’t done so yet.”Mr. Coleman said the museum’s board could not elaborate on its ongoing investigation, but he expected it to be concluded by the end of November.Ms. Raicovich said the decision regarding the Israel event, which was made by the board, simply had to do with an application of the museum’s space rental practice, which has not permitted art fund-raisers, auctions or political events. The board then decided to overrule its initial decision and allow the event upon realizing that a museum official had led the Israeli Ambassador to believe the rental would proceed.“The decision was not anti-Semitic,” Ms. Raicovich said. “The accusation is very painful. This is not who I am. My grandmother helped young Jewish men escape across the border out of fascist Italy during the war. My husband is the grandson of Holocaust survivors. I have dedicated my career to freedom of expression, inclusiveness and civic discourse.”For Ms. Raicovich, immigration issues are also personal. Her father is Italian; her mother, Italian-American. Raised mostly in Roslyn, N.Y., she also spent years in Milan and Bucharest as a child when her father worked as a banker there.The Queens Museum — built as a pavilion for the 1939 World’s Fair and then home to the United Nations General Assembly before becoming a museum in 1972 — was physically in her life at an early age; she learned to drive a stick shift nearby, often stalling in front of its entrance.After a brief stint at the Guggenheim, she spent 10 years at Dia Art Foundation, before joining the nonprofit Creative Time in 2012 to expand the organization’s international presence.Because the Queens Museum has a collaborative quality and loyal staff similar to that of Dia and Creative Time, Ms. Raicovich said she felt “at home” in becoming director. Nevertheless, she said there has been a learning curve in “understanding what it means to be in Queens.”“What is hyper local here is intrinsically linked to what is international,” she said.In addition to mounting exhibitions like the artist Patty Chang’s multimedia “Wandering Lake” or “Never Built New York,” about unrealized architectural plans, the museum offers Immigrant Movement International, a community storefront space on Roosevelt Avenue that provides free educational, health and legal services. And the museum will in the next few years house a branch of the Queens Public Library.“The highest-level curatorial program also has to be rooted in the realm of the real,” Ms. Raicovich said.“To be a responsible citizen in a democracy, one has to be involved in a kind of civic engagement,” she added. “Culture has a huge role to play in that. And museums have a huge role to play in that.”', 'In Egypt, Furious Retaliation but Failing Strategy in Sinai - The New York TimesCAIRO — After militants massacred 305 people at a packed mosque on Friday in a stunning assault on a sacred place, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi responded as he knows best.Mr. Sisi went on television vowing to “take revenge” and strike back with an “iron fist.” Moments later, Egyptian warplanes swooped over the vast deserts of the Sinai Peninsula, dropping bombs that pulverized vehicles used in the assault. Soldiers fanned out across the area.But that furious retaliation, which follows years of battle in Sinai against a vicious Islamic State affiliate that downed a Russian passenger jet in 2015 and has regularly attacked Egyptian security forces there, revived the most troubling question about Mr. Sisi’s strategy in the desert peninsula: Why is it failing?One of the most striking aspects of the carnage that unfolded on Friday, the deadliest terrorist attack in Egypt’s modern history, was how easy it was for the militants to carry it out.In a statement issued on Saturday, Egypt’s prosecutor general, Nabil Sadek, described the grisly scene in forensic detail.Between 25 and 30 gunmen, traveling in five vehicles and carrying an Islamic State flag, surrounded a Sufi mosque on all sides in Bir al-Abed, a dusty town on a road that arcs across the sandy plain of North Sinai.After an explosion, they positioned themselves outside the main entrance of the mosque and its 12 windows, spraying the worshipers with gunfire. Seven parked cars were set ablaze to prevent victims from escaping. Among the dead were 27 children.For Sinai residents, the attack deepened an abiding sense of dread about life in a part of Egypt where many feel trapped between barbarous militants and a heartless military. At a hospital in nearby Ismailia, survivors recounted how they leapt through windows as militants raked them with gunfire, or of watching their friends and relatives die.“If even mosques are being targeted, then where are we safe?” said Mohamed Abdel Salam, 22.For Sinai experts, the assault sharpened scrutiny of Egypt’s counterinsurgency tactics against a dogged Islamist insurgency that has surged in strength since 2013, after Mr. Sisi came to power in a military takeover.They paint a picture of a stubbornly outmoded approach that is unsuited to the fight, and that perpetuates the mistakes of successive Egyptian leaders.For decades Egypt has seen Sinai through a military prism, taking an aggressive approach to an alienated local population. The military has engaged in summary executions and the destruction of whole villages, while offering little to solve the region’s deep social and economic problems, including chronic unemployment, illiteracy and poor access to health care.Egyptian soldiers and conscripts are hunkered down inside heavily protected bases, venturing out in armored convoys that barrel down long, exposed roads.Those roads are filled with check posts manned by nervous soldiers, many of them conscripts. The insurgents, some with roots in Sinai’s long tradition of smuggling, skirt through the desert.“The Egyptians have failed to acknowledge that ISIS is not just a terrorism threat,” said Andrew Miller, a former Egypt specialist at the National Security Council, now at the Project on Middle East Democracy in Washington. “Killing terrorists is not sufficient. They need to deprive ISIS of local support, which is rooted in Cairo’s historical neglect of the Sinai.”But that support has been eroded by multiple accounts of torture and extrajudicial executions by the military, as well as indiscriminate military tactics that often inflict civilian casualties and sow widespread resentment.“The military has never cared for civilian losses,” said Mohannad Sabry, author of a book on Sinai. “The excessive and reckless use of force has killed entire families. We’ve seen airstrikes blow people up in their homes. We’ve seen villages razed off the face of the earth. That tells you something about how they see Sinai society.”Over the past year, Mr. Sisi has welcomed a line of foreign leaders to Cairo, where he signed deals for billions of dollars in advanced military equipment: German submarines, Russian combat helicopters, a French aircraft carrier and a military satellite. American military officials have tried quietly to persuade him to allocate his resources, including $1.3 billion in annual American aid, to tools and techniques better suited to fighting the insurgency in Sinai, like equipment and training for intelligence gathering.But Mr. Sisi, they say, is not listening, and his generals prefer to buy tanks, jets and other heavy weapons for their bases around the Nile.“They understand they have got a problem in Sinai, but they have been unprepared to invest in the capabilities to deal with it,” said Steven Simon, a professor at Amherst College and a former senior director for the Middle East and North Africa on the National Security Council.One person who did have some sway over Mr. Sisi was Egypt’s chief of defense staff, Mahmoud Hegazy. American officials saw him as the only person in Mr. Sisi’s inner circle with the authority to publicly contradict him, a former United States official said. They also had a personal bond: General Hegazy’s daughter is married to Mr. Sisi’s son.But last month Mr. Sisi fired General Hegazy, after an outcry over a devastating militant ambush on a security convoy south of Cairo that killed 16 police officers, and possibly many more.The move dismayed senior State and Defense Department officials who saw General Hegazy as a check on Mr. Sisi in a circle of advisers that has become ever smaller and, some fear, ever more sycophantic, said the former official, who spoke anonymously to protect internal deliberations on an important ally that rarely receives public criticism well.Sinai presents a formidable arena for counterinsurgency that would challenge the most capable army: It is a vast terrain of desert and mountains, with long shorelines and a semiporous back door across the border into Gaza, which has been controlled by Hamas.The collapse of Libya in 2011 has ensured a steady flow of weapons ever since, some from the depots of the deposed Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi. In the past year, as the Islamic State’s vision of a caliphate in Syria and Iraq has crumbled, experts have fretted about an influx of returning Egyptian jihadis, bent on bringing their fight back home.So far, American officials say, a relatively small number of fighters have returned. But the collapse of Raqqa and Mosul has precipitated a sharp shift in the Islamic State’s tactics in Sinai, with a greater emphasis on attacks against soft targets, like Coptic Christians and Sufis, in a bid to undermine Mr. Sisi by sowing sectarian hatred in Egyptian society.Little of Egypt’s fight against the Islamic State in Sinai is visible to the outside world, or even most Egyptians. Foreign reporters and most Egyptian ones are not allowed into Sinai. Concrete information about the conflict is hard to come by: On its Facebook page, the Egyptian military claims to have killed at least 3,000 Islamist militants, far more than the hundreds it once estimated were there.A leaked videotape last April depicted those claims in a very different light. It showed a military unit, made up of Sinai locals and accompanied by senior army officers, executing detainees — local men in jeans — on a desolate patch of ground in Sinai. Earlier, on its Facebook page, the army had claimed the men died in a shootout.Amnesty International, which confirmed the video’s authenticity, said it was consistent with a pattern of military-led abuses it has documented in Sinai.In private, Mr. Sisi’s officials argue that they don’t need to take lessons from the Americans. They point to what they say is a failure of American counterinsurgency ventures in Iraq and Afghanistan. And they add that their methods worked in the 1990s and 2000s, at least temporarily and in other parts of Egypt, when President Hosni Mubarak authorized harsh measures to disarm militants who attacked Western tourists at historical sites.“They look back and say: This is how we did it, and it worked,” said Zack Gold, a Sinai expert at the Hariri Center at the Atlantic Council. But, Mr. Gold added, the conditions are radically different in North Sinai, where residents have suffered years of neglect and mistreatment from the Egyptian mainland.Sinai residents complain of feeling isolated, even culturally distant, from the Nile Valley where the vast majority of Egyptians live. Many in the North Sinai refer to other Egyptians as “people of the valley,” as though they were citizens of another country. Some speak nostalgically of more effective governance when the peninsula was under Israeli control, between the Israeli seizure of the area in the Six Day war in 1967 and its return to Egypt in 1982.The Bedouin tribes who live there, often portrayed as outlaws in Egyptian popular culture, say they feel greater kinship with the tribes in Gaza — a connection that has bred longstanding suspicion among officials in Cairo, especially since the Israeli occupation.South Sinai, around Sharm el Sheikh, and Mount Sinai developed into a tourist destination. But the North remained loosely governed and some of the tribes who lived there considered smuggling a birthright, and resented Cairo’s attempts to restrict it.“Many Egyptians west of the Suez don’t consider the Bedouin to be fully Egyptian,” Mr. Miller, the analyst, said. “They have poorer educational and employment opportunities, and they are largely shut out of government jobs and the security services.”Cynicism about the central government was evident outside the Ismailia hospital on Friday, where an elderly Bedouin woman in black sat on the muddy lawn, huddled under a blanket for warmth. She refused to give her name, citing fear of reprisals from either the military and Islamic State. “If either side sees our names, they will kill us. They are as bad as each other,” she said.“The military will keep jailing and killing local young people. The terrorists who hate us and the Christians will keep using it as an excuse to kill us,” she added. “There is no point in talking about anything.”', 'Rex Tillerson, Visiting Europe, Gets Cold Shoulder - The New York TimesBRUSSELS — For decades, America’s chief diplomat has been greeted in Europe’s heart with broad smiles and open arms.That tradition appeared to have been suspended on Tuesday.Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson’s reception in Brussels was distinctly chilly, as disappointment among European diplomats in President Trump’s nationalistic tone and insulting messages on Twitter built into quiet fury on the eve of an expected  announcement that the United States would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Such a move could infuriate the Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem to be their capital in a future Palestinian state.In a brief public appearance beside Mr. Tillerson, Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s top diplomat, gave the kind of stone-cold statement of facts that she would normally provide standing beside her Russian counterpart, not the American one.She made clear that the European Union saw the Trump administration’s possible announcement on Jerusalem as a threat to peace in the Middle East.“We believe that any action that would undermine these efforts must absolutely be avoided,” she said. “A way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as a future capital of both states.”Ms. Mogherini also warned the United States not to walk away from the Iran nuclear deal, something President Trump has said he may do.“The continued implementation of the Iran nuclear deal is a key strategic priority for European security but also for regional and global security,” she said.Mr. Tillerson’s spokesman, R.C. Hammond, acknowledged the less-than-warm reception.“Allies have been very frank today in sharing some of their views,” Mr. Hammond said.Ms. Mogherini’s remarks came just hours after Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel of Germany declared at a foreign policy conference in Berlin that relations with the United States “will never be the same” and said that the Trump administration increasingly viewed Europe as a “competitor or economic rival” rather than an ally.On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron of France warned Mr. Trump in a phone call that recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was a bad idea, joining leaders from Jordan, Egypt, Turkey and the Arab League in speaking out publicly against the move.Mr. Trump’s nationalistic rhetoric and frequent complaints about what he sees as European freeloading on American military spending has long grated on European leaders, but in recent weeks their annoyance has turned to anger.When Mr. Tillerson and Ms. Mogherini gave public statements, Ms. Mogherini never smiled and she refused to answer questions.Into this growing rift the Trump administration sent a chief diplomat who could be pushed out within weeks and has little of the president’s confidence, according to senior administration officials.For his part, Mr. Tillerson stood beside Ms. Mogherini and offered innocuous comments in which he reaffirmed “the important role that the European alliance plays in our shared security objectives.”Mr. Tillerson spoke at far greater length in a morning visit to the United States Embassy in Brussels but spent most of his time describing his departmental reorganization effort, not addressing the growing diplomatic challenges his employees face in Europe and elsewhere.He admitted that the Trump administration had yet to notch a single major diplomatic victory.“While we don’t have any wins on the board yet, I can tell you we’re in much better position to advance America’s interests around the world than we were 10 months ago,” Mr. Tillerson said.He promised to announce his reorganization plans within weeks and grew animated when describing the process. Mr. Tillerson made the remarks at the ambassadorial residence, which is not presently occupied. The administration has yet to nominate ambassadors to both Belgium and the European Union.From Brussels, Mr. Tillerson heads to Vienna, where three ambassadorial jobs — to Austria and two European bodies — also remain unfilled. Dozens of top jobs in the department are empty.“We’re still awaiting a lot of nominees to clear the processes and be confirmed,” he told the gathering. “I get a little criticism for that from time to time.”Mr. Tillerson’s own delays in identifying leaders also has been a big obstacle. Now that he may leave within weeks, the White House vetting process for his choices has slowed to a crawl.', 'Writing at the Speed of Trump’s Scandals - The New York TimesHow does an opinion writer keep up in the Age of Trump? Since it’s a question I often get, I thought I’d share four days’ worth of my false starts and might-have-been ledes.On Tuesday’s news that North Korea had test-fired a ballistic missile that could hit Washington, D.C., I started drafting a piece that opened as follows:“Jim Mattis is familiar with Napoleon’s famous orders to one of his field marshals, ‘If you start to take Vienna — take Vienna.’ As a commander in Iraq in 2004, Mattis used an F-bombed version of the line to rage against the Bush administration’s abrupt decision to pull back from a planned assault on the city of Falluja. Tough talk married to visible hesitation is the worst approach possible toward an enemy.“But that’s also a good description of the Trump administration’s policy toward Pyongyang today. …”Then came Wednesday morning, and Donald Trump was in another Twitter fever. Were we reliving the Madness of King George for the nuclear age? Or was something more sinister at work? A different column was in order:“If you want to understand the ways in which Donald Trump’s presidency is systematically corrupting the American mind, I have a book recommendation for you. It’s about Vladimir Putin’s Russia. …”Within an hour of filing the piece, which appeared Thursday, I was reproaching myself for not mentioning Trump’s vile retweets of a British far-right extremist. So I scribbled the following lede for this column:“Donald Trump’s apologists have a simple way of dealing with the president’s unhinged Twitter stream: They ignore it. ‘Watch what he does, not what he says,’ is the tantric mantra of the hear-no-evil right.“That’s a line that will be harder to defend now that the president’s retweets of a British bigot have precipitated a gratuitous and self-inflicted crisis in relations with our closest ally. …”Then the news about Rex Tillerson’s slow-motion political execution hit. Start again:“In October, CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Rex Tillerson whether he felt castrated by Donald Trump. ‘I checked; I’m fully intact,’ the secretary of state cracked. He might want to check again.“The senior member of the cabinet is being subjected to the kind of humiliation he has spent the past 10 months inflicting on his own department. There’s a kind of animal-kingdom justice in this, like in one of those YouTube videos in which a tiger shark eats a hammerhead. …”Next thing I know, the Michael Flynn story erupts.“Here’s my suggestion to any burger-joint franchise looking to expand in a blue state: Create a new sandwich consisting of two mammoth meat patties separated by a fried egg, slathered in barbecue sauce and served with fried onions, bacon, guacamole, two tomato slices and a dash of habanero sauce, on a buttered sesame seed bun.“Call it the Nothingburger. You can eat all 1,900 calories of it and still pretend you’re on a diet.“That’s the dish that Robert Mueller just served with the guilty plea of the disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. For months, the Nothingburger right has tried to claim that the special counsel was another Captain Ahab and collusion his white whale, that Paul Manafort was being brought up on charges that had nothing to do with his work for Trump, that the foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos was a nonentity in the campaign, and that evidence of collusion between the president and the Kremlin was thinner than Soviet toilet paper.“That version of events is impossible to sustain. A ‘very senior member’ of the presidential transition team directed Flynn while he was in contact with the Russian Embassy, undermining the Obama administration’s foreign policy in its final days — at a minimum, a violation of the old Logan Act. Was it Jared Kushner who directed these contacts? And did Trump direct Kushner?“We already knew that Flynn lied about his contacts with the embassy. Now it seems that the Trump team misled when it said it didn’t really know what Flynn was up to. And we have a clearer idea of why the president was desperate to get then-F.B.I. Director James Comey to go easy on Flynn.“Administration fluffers such as Sean Hannity and Mark Levin will say that none of this implicates the president. Neither did a certain burglary in 1972. It’s the cover-up that’s usually the crime. They will also say the outreach to Russia was for a good purpose, to save Israel from a harmful U.N. resolution. But it was also about easing pressure on Russia, Iran’s preferred arms supplier.“In the meantime, Flynn will continue to be a cooperative witness. More shoes will drop. And the odds that Trump won’t serve out his term grow greater.”Or something like that. One of these days I’ll get around to writing about smaller stories.Like, you know, the tax bill.', 'The Good Kind of Schmaltz - The New York TimesBAD RABBIAnd Other Strange but True Stories From the Yiddish PressBy Eddy Portnoy265 pp. Stanford University Press. Paper, $19.95.In the staid world of academic Yiddishists, Eddy Portnoy is a live wire, a funny guy, a mischief-maker, what they used to call in the Catskills, a tummler.Portnoy, who works at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, has written about Jewish professional wrestling in pre-World War II Warsaw and Yiddish Communist puppet theater in Depression-era New York. His dissertation concerned the cartoons in the Yiddish-language press and “Bad Rabbi” grew out of hours spent fast-forwarding through microfilm. One day Portnoy let go of the dial on the machine too early and found himself staring at an account of a brawl that erupted at a rabbinical court adjudicating a tawdry case of bigamy.The story, which had the headline “Two Wives, Blazing Punches and — the Cops,” was the tip of the iceberg. To switch metaphors, Portnoy knew he’d fallen into a shmaltz grub (a tub of chicken fat), the Yiddish equivalent of a pot of gold. He had discovered “The Jerry Springer Show,” 1920s Warsaw edition.“Bad Rabbi” is a succession of outlandish misadventures, a wild panorama populated by an astonishing array of characters: Blimp Levy, the 650-pound wrestler and lady’s man; Urke Nachlnik, the yeshiva student turned criminal kingpin turned Yiddish playwright; Naftali Herz Imber, the hard-drinking professional psychic who, among other things, wrote the words to the Zionist anthem “Hatikvah.”Only a few of these characters were noted in the English-language press. The case of the devout, apparently insane Pesach Rubenstein, who murdered his pregnant cousin in 1875, was, as Portnoy puts it, the “first major interface between Jews, the justice system, and the press in America” — although it lingered far longer in Jewish consciousness. The Yiddish journalist Abraham Cahan noted in his autobiography that when he arrived in the United States in 1881, Jews were still talking about the case.While vengeful lovers, demented blackmailers and unscrupulous abortionists may represent universal types, the Yiddish press also gleefully reported on specifically Jewish affairs — like the pitched battles between Jewish freethinkers and so-called Sabbath enforcers.Portnoy’s subjects are those he calls the “unsung heroes of the Jewish underclass,” but the secret stars in “Bad Rabbi” are the largely anonymous Yiddish journalists who chronicled their foibles. The Yiddish newspaper was, perhaps even more than the Yiddish theater, a sanctuary where Jews could speak to Jews, confidentially. A wave of Jewish suicides and attempted suicides in Warsaw during the late 1920s were reported on with an outrageous mixture of hard-boiled cynicism and, in the case of bungled or bizarre attempts, dark humor.Yiddish journalists were showboats, garnishing tabloid sensationalism with literary jokes and religious references. (Given this high-low style, as well as its caustic attitudinizing and internal feuds, the Yiddish press seems like a flamboyant forerunner to the old Village Voice.) Such zesty informality carries over into Portnoy’s own writing, which, in blending the erudite and vernacular, regularly tilts toward the latter.According to Portnoy, “nearly every great Yiddish writer was also, at some point in his or her career, a journalist.” His prime example is the Warsaw reporter writing under the pseudonym Gimel Kuper, whose pieces Portnoy characterizes as “Fiddler on the Roof” meets Charles Bukowski. Kuper’s cover was blown when a rival Yiddish paper outed him as the serious novelist Israel Joshua Singer, elder brother of Isaac Bashevis Singer.“Bad Rabbi” includes a sample of Kuper’s reportage — on a court where criminals mete out justice to their own — that is every bit as flavorsome and sardonic as a Bashevis Singer short story. Indeed, Portnoy’s chapter on the madcap sectarian battles occasioned by the Miss Judea beauty contest of 1929 is itself a gem of comic writing with a ferocious kicker worthy of either of the Brothers Singer.', '                                    File photo - 13th century mosaic of Jesus Christ in the church of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey (iStock)                                                                            (hadynyah)                                                                    Biblical scholars have discovered the first-known original Greek copy of an ancient forbidden Christian text that purportedly describes Jesus’ secret teachings to his “brother” James, an early leader of the Church.Geoffrey Smith and Brent Landau, religious studies scholars at The University of Texas at Austin, located the rare text in Oxford University archives earlier this year. The experts found several fifth- or sixth-century A.D. Greek fragments of the First Apocalypse of James, one of the books from an ancient collection known as the Nag Hammadi library. Previously, the text was thought to be preserved only via translations in the Egyptian Coptic language.Only a small number of texts from the Nag Hammadi library, a collection of 13 Coptic Gnostic books discovered in Egypt in 1945, have been found in Greek, their original language of composition. Also known as the “Gnostic Gospels,” the books are seen as key documents forunderstandingGnosticism, an ancient belief system.NEW EVIDENCE DATES CHRIST’S TOMB TO ROMAN ERA, MATCHING HISTORICAL RECORDSThe First Apocalypse of James, like the other books in the Nag Hammadi library, was deemed heretical or forbidden by the church because it fell outside of the fourth-century religious boundaries that defined the 27-book New Testament.File photo - a page from the Coptic translation of the First Apocalypse of James from the Coptic Museum in Cairo, Egypt. Digitized by Claremont College (Nag Hammadi Library, Oxford University)        Experts were thrilled by the discovery of the ancient fragments, which are owned by the Egypt Exploration Society.“To say that we were excited once we realized what we’d found is an understatement,” said Smith, an assistant professor of religious studies, in a statement. “We never suspected that Greek fragments of the First Apocalypse of James survived from antiquity. But there they were, right in front of us.”INCREDIBLE 1,500-YEAR-OLD CHRISTIAN MOSAIC UNCOVERED IN ISRAELThe document is said to describe Jesus’ secret teachings to his “brother” James. Details of the “heavenly realm” and future events, such as James’ inevitable death, are revealed, according to The University of Texas at Austin.Geoffrey Smith (left) and Brent Landau take a closer look at the Greek fragment identified as the First Apocalypse of James. The fragments--and rights to published images of them--are owned by the Egypt Exploration Society. (Photo provided by Geoffrey Smith, UT Austin)        “The text supplements the biblical account of Jesus’ life and ministry,” Smith added.There are a number of interpretations of references to Jesus\' siblings in biblical texts.

The First Apocalypse of JamesdescribesJames as not Jesus’ brother “materially.”Other interpretations describe James as Jesus\' step-brother or cousin.The manuscript, which uses neat, uniform handwriting and words separated into syllables, was probably a teacher’s model used to help students read and write, according to the experts. “The scribe has divided most of the text into syllables by using mid-dots. Such divisions are very uncommon in ancient manuscripts, but they do show up frequently in manuscripts that were used in educational contexts,” said Landau, a lecturer in the UT Austin Department of Religious Studies, in the statement.Landau notes that the teacher who produced the manuscript likely “had a particular affinity for the text.” The document, he explains, appears to be a complete copy of the forbidden ancient text.This story has been updated with information from the Gospels of Matthew and Mark.Follow James Rogers on Twitter@jamesjrogers', 'Zarrab’s Take From Iran Sanctions Plot? ‘Maybe $150 Million,’ He Says - The New York TimesReza Zarrab, the government’s star witness in a trial involving a billion-dollar conspiracy to smuggle gold for oil in violation of United States sanctions on Iran, testified on Tuesday that he had made huge sums of money in the scheme — but he could not recall the precise amount.“I don’t remember exactly but it could be $100 million,” Mr. Zarrab, who helped orchestrate the scheme, told the jury through an interpreter. “Maybe more than that. Maybe $150 million.”Mr. Zarrab’s testimony came on his fifth day on the witness stand in Federal District Court in Manhattan as he was cross-examined by a lawyer for a Turkish banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who is on trial for his alleged involvement in the sanctions evasion.Mr. Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian citizen who was arrested on a 2016 family trip to Disney World, testified last week that in 2012, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then Turkey’s prime minister and now its president, personally ordered that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in the scheme.Mr. Zarrab also testified that he had paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to the country’s then economy minister, Zafer Caglayan.Before Mr. Zarrab secretly pleaded guilty on Oct. 26 to conspiring in the sanctions scheme, he was to have been tried along with Mr. Atilla. His plea and cooperation agreement were revealed last week when the trial began.On Tuesday, during his cross-examination, Mr. Zarrab offered new details about an unrelated charge to which he also pleaded guilty — bribing a guard at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was held, in return for contraband like alcohol and for the use of the guard’s cellphone.Mr. Zarrab revealed Tuesday that the bribe was about $45,000, and said the payment had been arranged by a lawyer in Turkey who was representing him and was in New York at the time. Mr. Zarrab did not identify the lawyer; one of his New York attorneys, Robert J. Anello, declined to comment. A jail spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mr. Zarrab’s testimony, now in its second week, continued to send political tremors through Turkey.Mr. Erdogan used his weekly address to parliamentarians from his Justice and Development Party on Tuesday to make a heated attack against the United States. He pointed to not just the trial, but also American support for Kurdish insurgents in Syria and United States policy in Israel.“It is now understood that the U.S.A. has a plan against us,” Mr. Erdogan told legislators. “It is obvious that this trial is brought up as a tool to blackmail us to give up our claims in the region.”Mr. Erdogan, who values his personal relationship with President Trump, suggested that holdovers from the Obama administration still in the United States government were trying to undermine the Trump administration.“This trial is also a piece of the big fight, the big strife in American domestic politics,” Mr. Erdogan said. “American media covers this trial alongside with the ‘Russia, Flynn, Trump’ headline.”Mr. Erdogan noted that the sanctions case indictment says “conspiracy.”“Yes, there is conspiracy — but against Turkey,” he said. As he has repeatedly in the past, he blamed followers of the cleric Fethullah Gulen, who he has accused of fomenting a failed coup against him in 2016.And in a warning to opponents at home, Mr. Erdogan said: “Whoever takes the trial in America as a matter of domestic politics is a collaborator in the treachery.”During Mr. Zarrab’s cross-examination, he also revealed that his lawyers first met with prosecutors as early as the summer of 2016 to discuss the possibility of his cooperating with the government, but the idea went nowhere. Then, this past August, he and his lawyers met with the government, leading to about a dozen sessions with prosecutors and F.B.I. agents, after which the government agreed to the cooperation deal.Mr. Zarrab also testified about his efforts before becoming a government witness to have his lawyers in Turkey and New York try to resolve his case outside of the court system. “Within the bounds of law, they did make efforts,” he said in response to a question from Cathy Fleming, a lawyer for Mr. Atilla.“In fact, you hired Rudy Giuliani and former Attorney General Michael Mukasey as your attorneys in the United States to try to work out a solution for you in Turkey, correct?” Ms. Fleming asked.“That is correct, ma’am,” Mr. Zarrab said.“In fact, you are furious with people in Turkey that it did not work, isn’t that true?” Ms. Fleming asked.“I don’t have any anger towards anybody, ma’am,” Mr. Zarrab replied.', 'Demonstrator protesting the Turkish president punched as they were led away by securityViolence broke out at another event involving Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday, four months after a widely publicized brawl in Washington that led to the indictment of 15 Turkish security personnel.The latest incident happened at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square while Erdogan – in town for the United Nations’ General Assembly -- was speaking at an event organized by the Turkish American National Steering Committee. A total of five protestors were briefly detained after the incident, an NYPD official told FoxNews.com, and there were no injuries or arrests.According to the Associated Press, the dust-up began after one demonstrator got up and shouted, “Terrorist!” during Erdogan’s speech. The man was grabbed by unidentified security officials and rushed out of the hall, while others in the crowd pushed, shoved and shouted. Another demonstrator then unfurled a banner for a banned Kurdish group, and was also escorted out.Robert Renas Amos, an American who previously volunteered with a Kurdish group in Syria to fight against ISIS militants, and was also involved in the brawl earlier this year, told Fox News he and four others went to the event to protest the death of American citizen Michael Israel, an American who was killed last year in Syria while fighting for the YPG.Amos said he was "dog-piled" by security guards dressed all in black, and was repeatedly kicked, and had his head slammed multiple times as he was taken out of the event. He also said the chaos only intensified as he was being pulled through the room, as random attendees at the event hit and kicked him.Amos said hotel security attempted to "protect" protestors from the crowd. "I felt someone grab me and say \'I got you\' just follow me, but then others started hitting," he claimed.NYPD officials could not verify if any of the protestors had been attacked by Turkish or private security personnel hired to work the event. Nor was the precise role of the various protective and law enforcement details at the event immediately determined.In May, what appeared to be packs of Turkish security personnel were clearly seen on video chasing after, hitting and kicking protesters who had gathered outside the Turkish ambassador\'s residence in Washington. Nineteen people were indicted last month following that incident, including 15 identified as Turkish security officers.That was the latest in a series of incidents around the world in recent years at which Erdogan security forces were accused of attacking or committing violence against protestors.ERDOGAN BODYGUARDS NO STRANGERS TO BEATDOWNSIn February 2016, during Erdogan’s visit to Ecuador, his bodyguards were blamed for applying similarly brutal tactics to suppress protesters, even allegedly breaking the nose of Ecuadorean lawmaker Diego Vintimilla.Ecuador’s then-President Rafael Correa called the incident “a chain of mistakes,” and fingered the Turkish bodyguards for starting the violence. “To be frank, you cannot do this in a foreign country,” he was quoted as saying.Three years ago, during a visit to a mining disaster in Soma, Turkey, Erdogan adviser Yusuf Yerkel became an unintended international viral celebrity when he was photographed viciously kicking at a protester -- who was being held down on the ground at the time by Turkish Special Forces.The bad PR generated by the photo only worsened when it turned out Yerkel then filed a medical report allowing him to miss seven days of work due to injuries sustained to his leg by the kicking.Only a month later, Erdogan’s guards were in action once again. This time it was in the city of Silivri, where Caner Oruc, a math teacher, reportedly shouted at Erdogan’s bus as it drove through the streets. According to Turkish press reports, Erdogan pointed out Oruc to his seven-member security team, who promptly hauled him into a nearby building, and beat him badly enough to break his nose.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Hollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

A $73 billion debt crisis has left agencies like the state power company broke. As a result the power company abandoned most basic maintenance in recent years, leaving the island subject to regular blackouts.A federal control board overseeing Puerto Rico\'s finances authorized up to $1 billion in local funds to be used for hurricane response, but Gov. Ricardo Rossello said he would ask for more."We\'re going to request waivers and other mechanisms so Puerto Rico can respond to this crisis," he said. "Puerto Rico will practically collect no taxes in the next month." U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez of New York said she will request a one-year waiver from the Jones Act, a federal law blamed for driving up prices on Puerto Rico by requiring cargo shipments there to move only on U.S. vessels as a means of supporting the U.S. maritime industry."We will use all our resources," Velazquez said. "We need to make Puerto Rico whole again. These are American citizens."Meanwhile, a group of anxious mayors arrived in San Juan to meet with Rossello to present a long list of items they urgently need. The north coastal town of Manati had run out of fuel and fresh water, Mayor Jose Sanchez Gonzalez said. "Hysteria is starting to spread. The hospital is about to collapse. It\'s at capacity," he said, crying. "We need someone to help us immediately."POWERLESS PUERTO RICO\'S STORM CRISIS DEEPENS WITH DAM THREATThe death toll from Maria in Puerto Rico was at least 10, including two police officers who drowned in floodwaters in the western town of Aguada. That number was expected to climb as officials from remote towns continued to check in with officials in San Juan.Authorities in the town of Vega Alta on the north coast said they had been unable to reach an entire neighborhood called Fatima, and were particularly worried about residents of a nursing home."I need to get there today," Mayor Oscar Santiago told the Associated Press. "Not tomorrow, today."Rossello said Maria would clearly cost more than the last major storm to wallop the island, Hurricane George in September 1998. "This is without a doubt the biggest catastrophe in modern history for Puerto Rico," he said.A dam upstream of the towns of Quebradillas and Isabela in northwest Puerto Rico was cracked but had not burst by Saturday afternoon as the water continued to pour out of rain-swollen Lake Guajataca. Federal officials said Friday that 70,000 people, the number who live in the surrounding area, would have to be evacuated. But Javier Jimenez, mayor of the nearby town of San Sebastian, said he believed the number was far smaller.Secretary of Public Affairs Ramon Rosario said about 300 families were in harm\'s way.The governor said there is "significant damage" to the dam and authorities believe it could give way at any moment. "We don\'t know how long it\'s going to hold. The integrity of the structure has been compromised in a significant way," Rossello said.The 345-yard (316-meter) dam, which was built around 1928, holds back a man-made lake covering about 2 square miles (5 square kilometers). More than 15 inches (nearly 40 centimeters) of rain from Maria fell on the surrounding mountains, swelling the reservoir.Officials said 1,360 of the island\'s 1,600 cellphone towers were downed, and 85 percent of above-ground and underground phone and internet cables were knocked out. With roads blocked and phones dead, officials said, the situation may worsen."We haven\'t seen the extent of the damage," Rossello told reporters in the capital. Rossello couldn\'t say when power might be restored.Maj. Gen. Derek P. Rydholm, deputy to the chief of the Air Force Reserve, said mobile communications systems were being flown in, but acknowledged "it\'s going to take a while" before people in Puerto Rico will be able to communicate with their families outside the island.The island\'s electric grid was in sorry shape long before Maria struck.

The damage was so extensive, the 64-year-old retiree said, that she didn\'t think the power would be turned back on until Christmas."This storm crushed us from one end of the island to the other," she said.Hour-long lines formed at the few gas stations that reopened on Friday and anxious residents feared power could be out for weeks — or even months — and wondered how they would cope."I\'m from here. I believe we have to step up to the task. If everyone leaves, what are we going to do?

He once called former Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, the first gay man to hold the post, a pedophile. Mr. Louis left Parliament in 2014.Mr. Louis was given a six-month suspended jail sentence and fined over $20,000 at his 2015 trial, which centered on online statements he made that questioned the number of Jews killed in gas chambers during the Holocaust. After that sentence was changed on Wednesday, he celebrated on Facebook and apologized “to anyone who may have been hurt by my remarks.”“All that is left for me to do is to go and report in the death camps,” he wrote in a statement. “No doubt, the Court has recognized my talents as a writer.”Mr. Louis is a marginal figure in Belgium, but political observers said his case illustrated growing worries about anti-Semitism as well as the different approaches that the United States and Europe have taken in response to the expression of far-right views.Vocal support for Nazism and denial or expressions of doubt about the Holocaust are criminal offenses in more than a dozen European countries, including France, Germany, Belgium and Poland, according to the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel. The type of punishment handed down to Mr. Louis is rare but has happened at least once before, in Hungary in 2013.That is in sharp contrast to the United States, where the right to express far-right views, including neo-Nazi beliefs and white supremacy, is protected by the First Amendment.In his statement on Wednesday, Mr. Louis said he would obey the ruling and “repent every year in a death camp.” In addition to being “very educational and very powerful on a human level,” he said the experience would also be a chance to “denounce current genocides.” That is language he has used in the past to refer to Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip.“Laurent Louis is generally considered as a baffoon,” said Dave Sinardet, a professor of political science at the Free University of Brussels. “He unites Belgian politicians all across the board in the sense that none of them take him seriously."But Deborah E. Lipstadt, a professor of history at Emory University in Atlanta, said even fringe figures should be taken seriously. She called his sentence “unusual.”“Don’t see this as one crazy guy who happens to be a Holocaust denier,” said Ms. Lipstadt, who opposes the criminalization of Holocaust denial. She is an expert on the subject: The Holocaust denier David Irving unsuccessfully sued her for libel in 1996, a trial that served as the basis for the 2016 film “Denial.”Mr. Sinardet said Mr. Louis’s election to Parliament in 2010 was “an accident” caused in part by the complexity of Belgium’s byzantine political system, which divides power between the country’s French- and Dutch-speaking communities.Mr. Louis joined and left or was expelled from several parties during his time in Parliament, often because of his “borderline racist declarations,” Mr. Sinardet said.Among them was a 2014 speech in defense of Dieudonné M’Bala M’Bala, a French comedian who has been tried repeatedly for anti-Semitic statements. He also created the quenelle, a hand gesture that resembles a Nazi salute.In the speech, Mr. Louis said Zionism was “worse” than Nazism and falsely claimed that the Talmud compared non-Jews to monkeys and that it “authorizes” Jews to rape non-Jewish children, according to a video of the speech posted to YouTube. Defending Mr. Dieudonné, he said the Holocaust was “one of the only historical facts that cannot be called into question.”At trial in 2015, online statements Mr. Louis made in support of the French far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen were found to have violated a law against the minimization, justification or approval of the Holocaust.“To summarize, I have invited the people who follow me to ask about Jean-Marie Le Pen’s condemnation of his remarks with regard to the gas chambers, which he considered to be a ‘detail’ of the Second World War,” Mr. Louis wrote in an email on Wednesday night. He said he had never denied the existence of the Holocaust, “but I have questioned the essential role of the gas chambers in this extermination and this questioning is prohibited by Belgian law.”Ms. Lipstadt said that defense was common among Holocaust deniers and others on the far right who “market” their beliefs by posing as reasonable people who are simply asking hard questions.“You could have someone who says, ‘Look I know the Holocaust happened, I don’t believe in that, but I think maybe it wasn’t as bad, maybe it was exaggerated,’” she said. And she worried that Mr. Louis could use his sentence to make more inflammatory claims.“When he said, ‘The court has recognized my talents as a writer?’ Give me a break,” she said. “Can he write, ‘Well, I went and I didn’t see anybody being killed’ or, ‘These gas chambers were incapable of killing someone?’”', 'Ervin Santana Shocked the Yankees 12 Years Ago. Can He Do It Again? - The New York TimesIt was after the matchup was set and the Minnesota Twins knew they would visit Yankee Stadium for the American League wild-card game when Neil Allen made the connection with his best starting pitcher. Ervin Santana would be facing the Yankees in a knockout game, and Allen, the Twins’ pitching coach, had seen it before.“You took money out of my pocket!” Allen told Santana on the bench in Minnesota on Saturday night.Santana laughed. “Hopefully, I can put some money back in,” he replied.Twelve years ago, Allen was the Yankees’ bullpen coach when they faced the Los Angeles Angels in the decisive fifth game of a division series in Anaheim. Shoulder trouble drove Angels starter Bartolo Colon from the mound in the second inning, and the Yankees felt lucky. Colon would soon be named the A.L. Cy Young Award winner, and his replacement was a 22-year-old from the Dominican Republic who had started the year in Class AA.“We were all pumped up and excited,” Allen said on Monday before the Twins’ afternoon workout in the Bronx. “We were thinking, ‘O.K., here we go!’ — and then Ervin Santana came out and pitched phenomenal. He was a rookie, and we all thought he’d be nervous and we’d be O.K.”The Yankees did get two quick runs after loading the bases with walks. But Santana poured in strikes after that, working into the seventh inning, earning the victory and sending a brawny Yankees lineup home for the winter.“Yeah, they were good,” Santana said Monday. “But no nerves at all. Just try not to think about it.”That would be sound advice for his current teammates. The Twins were so bad last season that they chose first in the draft this past June. Now they are the first team ever to reach the playoffs after losing at least 100 games in the previous season — but to extend their fun, they must successfully escape the Bronx, where they are 14-45 since 2002.That record includes four flops in division series, most recently in 2010, and a three-game sweep last month. Santana allowed two runs (one on an Aaron Judge homer) over five and two-thirds innings to lose the opener, 2-1, on Sept. 18, and the Yankees won the next two games handily. Santana is 0-5 at the new Yankee Stadium, with a 6.43 E.R.A.“The difference is it’s October, and it’s one game,” Twins Manager Paul Molitor said. “It’s going to be a little bit more electric than what we even saw a couple of weeks ago. Emotion is a good thing.”The Twins believe Santana can harness it. He has experienced plenty since that first postseason win: three more teams, two All-Star appearances and one no-hitter, as well as a suspension for performance-enhancing drugs two years ago. His nickname is Magic, after Earvin “Magic” Johnson.Santana tags many Twitter posts with #SMELLBASEBALL, which he said reflects his passion for the game. On Monday, he found an inspirational message that fit the Twins’ challenge: a quotation from David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel. “Anyone who doesn’t believe in miracles is not a realist,” Santana wrote in the post, adding a GIF of the 1980 United States hockey team celebrating its Olympic triumph over the Soviet team.“Just trying to be positive and create good things for me and our team,” Santana said.The Twins led the A.L. in runs scored after the All-Star break, helped by a few September blowouts over also-rans. They have a balanced offense, including seven hitters with at least 69 R.B.I. (the Yankees have just three). But they cannot expect to score many runs off Luis Severino and the Yankees’ deep, powerful bullpen.“When you have a dominant bullpen,” Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said, “you go to them early.”The Twins’ best hope is Santana, who used his fastballs, sliders and changeups to go 16-8 this season with a 3.28 E.R.A. and three shutouts. They could back up him up with the young starter Jose Berrios and relievers Trevor Hildenberger, Taylor Rogers and Matt Belisle. But in the brief history of the wild-card game, starters have made an overwhelming difference.Since baseball introduced this format in 2012, half of the wild-card games have been won by starters who allowed no runs, and all of those starters were playing on the road: Tampa Bay’s Alex Cobb in Cleveland (2013); San Francisco’s Madison Bumgarner in Pittsburgh (2014) and at Citi Field (2016); the Cubs’ Jake Arrieta in Pittsburgh (2015); and Houston’s Dallas Keuchel in the Bronx (2015).That is why Tuesday is so fraught with danger for the Yankees. They led the A.L. in home runs, scored more runs than the Twins and had a much better E.R.A. The teams had such different expectations midseason that in late July, when the Yankees needed a veteran starting pitcher, Minnesota sent them Jaime Garcia for prospects.But the Twins recovered, roaring through August and hanging on to claim the final playoff spot in a league that had 10 teams with losing records. If this were a series, they would be in more trouble. For one game, though, victory is plausible — even in the Bronx in October.The Twins actually won their playoff openers at the old Yankee Stadium in 2003 and 2004, both times with a starter named Santana allowing no runs. Back then, it was Johan Santana — no relation to Ervin, and a better pitcher. But as omens go, the Twins might as well take it.They have another in this Santana, the one who helped eliminate the Yankees in his playoff debut. Each batter he faced that night has retired or moved on, but Santana, now 34, will try to summon the same old magic.“If you can go out and do that as a rookie, and with all the other résumé he’s got under him since 2005, I feel very confident in who we’re running out there,” said Allen, the pitching coach. “He’s been on that big stage, he’s had the lights on him, and he knows what he’s going to do. I couldn’t ask for a better fit.”', 'N.F.L., Angela Merkel, Iraqi Kurdistan: Your Monday Briefing - The New York Times (Want to get this briefing by email?

The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train. Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece. Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time.  “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the  Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.   Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June. Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says. With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and  escorted them from the museum.On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter. Ivan Guilbert is on Instagram.

(REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski )                                                                    Energy firms in North America and Europe are facing a new wave of cyberattacks that could wreak havoc on their operations, according to security expert Symantec.In a report released this week, Symantec explained that the group behind the attacks is known as Dragonfly. The cyber espionage group has been in operation since 2011 and, after a quiet period when it was closely scrutinized by security researchers, has re-emerged over the past two years.The so-called “Dragonfly 2.0” campaign began in late 2015 and harnessed similar techniques to the earlier Dragonfly attacks. “The Dragonfly group appears to be interested in both learning how energy facilities operate and also gaining access to operational systems themselves, to the extent that the group now potentially has the ability to sabotage or gain control of these systems should it decide to do so,” explained Symantec, in its report.The organizations targeted are not named in the report.RUSSIAN CYBERSECURITY FIRM KASPERSKY LAB A 'DANGER' TO US SECURITY, SENATOR WARNSThe company said that it has “strong indications” of attacker activity in organizations in the U.S., Turkey, and Switzerland, with “traces of activity” in organizations outside of those countries. “The U.S. and Turkey were also among the countries targeted by Dragonfly in its earlier campaign, though the focus on organizations in Turkey does appear to have increased dramatically in this more recent campaign,” it said.Dragonfly 2.0 harnesses a host of techniques to attack energy firms, including malicious emails, so-called ‘watering hole attacks’ that use infected websites and ‘Trojanized’ software that can unleash malicious code on computer systems.The earliest activity in the latest campaign was a malicious email campaign that sent emails disguised as an invitation to a New Year’s Eve party to energy sector targets in December 2015, according to Symantec.Dragonfly 2.0 raises a very real risk of sabotage. “The original Dragonfly campaigns now appear to have been a more exploratory phase where the attackers were simply trying to gain access to the networks of targeted organizations,” explained Symantec. “The Dragonfly 2.0 campaigns show how the attackers may be entering into a new phase, with recent campaigns potentially providing them with access to operational systems, access that could be used for more disruptive purposes in future.”CANADIAN UNIVERSITY FALLS VICTIM TO EMAIL PHISHING SCAM, LOSES $9.5M TO FRAUDSTERSResearchers cited the attackers’ use of screen captures as evidence of their plans to access energy networks.The identity of the Dragonfly 2.0 attackers remains cloaked in mystery. “Some of the group’s activity appears to be aimed at making it more difficult to determine who precisely is behind it,” wrote Symantec, noting that the attackers rely heavily on generally available malware. Some code strings in the malware, however, were in Russian, although some were also in French. One of the languages may be a so-called “false flag” that aims to confuse any investigators looking to reveal the attackers’ identities.Despite the clear threat posed by the group, Symantec noted that its customers are protected against Dragonfly attacks.Experts agree that the report underlines the need for energy firms to keep their systems locked down. “The power grid penetration incidents are terrifying and really hit home the importance of having a solid cybersecurity strategy in place for organizations of all types,” explained Varun Badhwar, CEO of cloud security company RedLock, in a statement emailed to Fox News.ISRAEL SECURITY CHIEF: TECH PREVENTED MORE THAN 2,000 LONE WOL TERRORATTACKS“What’s interesting here is the relatively unsophisticated methods the hacking group has used,” added Leigh-Anne Galloway, cyber security resilience lead at security specialist Positive Technologies. Galloway noted that attacks on the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems used to manage power plants have traditionally used zero-day, or previously unknown, vulnerabilities. “In this case though, they’ve chosen to go for the older, but most effective methods of phishing and watering holes to get in. Of course, one the attackers are in, they would then still carry out exploits. But phishing is an effective first stage.”In its report, Symantec also pointed to the cyber attacks that disrupted Ukraine’s power network in 2015 and 2016.North Korea recently threatened to hit the U.S. with an electromagnetic pulse, which experts warn could cause disruption to the country’s power grids.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", 'Austria Is Poised to Shift Sharply Right in Election - The New York TimesVIENNA — Austrians rejected a right-wing populist to represent them as head of state by a wafer-thin margin last year. But after a general campaign focused on immigration and rocked by scandal, voters appear poised in elections this Sunday to give populism a new push by granting a far-right party at least a share of power in the next government.The recent Austrian presidential election, followed by the defeat of far-right candidates in the Netherlands and in France this year, appeared to blunt the surge of populism in Europe. But last month, the far-right Alternative for Germany party won more than 90 seats in the German Parliament, making it the third-largest bloc in the legislature. A strong performance in Austria by the far-right Freedom Party could give populists additional momentum.If the polls are correct, the party could emerge from voting on Sunday in second place, with a strong chance of returning to the government for the first time in more than a decade, most likely as the junior partner in a government led by the conservative People’s Party.While Austria is among the wealthier countries in Europe, it is struggling to get people back to work after five years of growing unemployment. Those economic troubles, combined with fears of globalization and the rapid pace of change driven by the digital revolution, have unsettled a normally consensus-seeking electorate.Such factors seem to have made many voters reluctant to trust another incarnation of the center-right coalition that has dominated politics in Vienna since the end of World War II. They also seem to have set the stage for Sebastian Kurz, 31, the foreign minister and leader of the People’s Party, refashioned for the campaign as the New People’s Party.The conservatives are leading the polls with about 33 percent of the vote, and Mr. Kurz could unseat Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland as the European Union’s youngest leader.Mr. Kurz, known for his slicked-back hair and open-collar shirts, entered politics in 2009 and rose quickly through the ranks of his flagging party. He took its leadership in May, demanding control to start a campaign centered primarily on him and on his reaching the chancellery.With a team of strategists, he created a detailed plan called Project Ballhaus — a reference to the address in Vienna of the chancellor’s office, on Ballhausplatz. It involved rebranding one of Europe’s most traditional conservative parties as a dynamic, digitally driven movement focused on change, going so far as to abandon its signature black color for a more modern turquoise.“He knows what he wants and is ruthless,” said Stefan Lehne, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe who focuses on the European Union. “You have a huge black block in Austria, and Mr. Kurz has painted this block turquoise and called it a movement, and pulled off the repackaging of one of the most boring and traditional parties in Europe. It’s brilliant.”Mr. Kurz, who made his name by negotiating an agreement with Austria’s Balkan neighbors to stem the flow of refugees from Greece, has advanced by co-opting the far-right’s push to limit immigration and to reinforce a national identity, but in a more moderate and polite tone. He campaigned on themes like protecting Austria’s social-welfare system, pledging to minimize refugees’ access to benefits and limiting the number of people allowed into the country.As foreign minister in the current government, where his party is the junior partner to the center-left Socialists under Chancellor Christian Kern, Mr. Kurz has taken a tough line on Turkey, insisting that the European Union drop membership talks.Few doubt Mr. Kurz’s political talents. He has built support for the New People’s Party to more than 30 percent from less than 20 percent in 2016. He has managed to criticize the government in which he was serving at the time for allowing tens of thousands of immigrants into the country in 2015. Among his campaign promises is that those in Austria illegally will be returned to their home countries.Many Austrians fear that the roughly 90,000 refugees who arrived in the country of 8.4 million from 2015 to 2016 are draining its resources, Mr. Kurz has said. “That is why I am proposing that refugees, who have never paid into the system, receive lower benefits,” he argued on Thursday in a final television debate among the five leading candidates. “And further drawing on the system by more immigrants will be halted.”Mr. Kurz’s emphasis on immigration has helped him siphon support from the Freedom Party, which has been polling at around 27 percent of the vote. He has campaigned heavily on ensuring the social welfare system remains viable for those Austrians whose contributions, drawn from their paychecks, helped create it.Mr. Kurz is expected to invite the Freedom Party to join the government, but few believe such a move would create a firestorm similar to that seen 17 years ago, when it joined a center-right government. Back then, when the party’s charismatic leader, Jörg Haider, was known to express sympathy for Nazi policies, its entrance into government met with weeks of protests in Vienna, worldwide outrage and economic sanctions from Israel and some members of the European Union.“Should it result in a coalition between the People’s Party and the Freedom Party, of course, there will be a lot of attention on Austria, especially from foreign media,” said Julia Ortner, a journalist and political commentator for the newspaper Vorarlberger Nachrichten. “But after what we have experienced elsewhere in Europe, especially in Hungary and even in the United States, it is no longer a taboo. It has already happened that rightist-populists have come into power, here and elsewhere in the world.”Entering into government would further solidify the Freedom Party’s place in the political mainstream, after it narrowly lost the presidential race in 2016. The party, founded by former Nazis in the 1950s, has twice served in government, from 1983 to 1986 and from 2000 to 2006.That time in power also led the party to sharply lose support, however. Mr. Haider, its former leader, died in a car accident in 2008.The party regrouped under the leadership of Heinz-Christian Strache, now 48, who sought to soften his image, at times shifting his focus from criticism of Muslim immigration to the governing coalition’s failures.“He was particularly calm, and the reason seems clear: He is no longer looking for protest votes, but wants to govern and is reacting accordingly calm and statesmanlike,” Peter Filzmaier, a professor of politics at Danube University Krems, told the broadcaster ORF after the debate on Thursday.Mr. Strache was further helped by a social media scandal worthy of a political mini-series, in which the Socialists were accused of a smear campaign against Mr. Kurz. The chancellor has denied any knowledge of the affair, overseen by an Israeli hired by the chancellor’s party, who was later fired.But the affair cost the Socialists support, with polls showing their popularity slipping by around 5 percentage points from before the news broke, forcing them to cede second place to the Freedom Party. It also earned them a rebuke from President Alexander Van der Bellen, who chided the leading candidates for breaking “political porcelain,” and weakening respect for the country’s democratic institutions.', 'Trump Alienates America’s Allies and Hands Iran a Victory - The New York TimesFor months, President Trump has made no secret of his desire to tear up one of the Obama administration’s top national security achievements: the nuclear accord with Iran, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A.Mr. Trump repeatedly bashed the agreement during last year’s campaign. Once in the White House, American law required the president to certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran was complying. Even Mr. Trump’s adversarial relationship with the truth could not dodge the fact that Iran is in compliance — as determined repeatedly by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the American intelligence community and our closest European allies. Mr. Trump has found it galling to certify — not once, but twice — that a deal he described as “the worst ever” and “an embarrassment” is working.So, the only remaining question was how Mr. Trump would justify pulling out. Now we know. In a tortured statement at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump laid out a long litany of Iranian misdeeds, from the 1979 hostage crisis to today, as the predicate for the need to deny the government in Tehran access to nuclear weapons. This presented the president with a logical dilemma, since that is exactly what the nuclear deal accomplishes, well into the future. To overcome it, Mr. Trump waxed disingenuous about the deal — weaving together misstatements, exaggerations and distortions — to trigger the one totally subjective standard for decertification in the 90-day review law: an assertion that the nuclear steps Iran is actually taking to implement the J.C.P.O.A. are insufficient to warrant the suspension of sanctions.Mr. Trump’s false narrative began with a whopper: that the Obama administration lifted sanctions “just before what would have been the total collapse of the Iranian regime” — an assertion wishful thinkers in Washington have been making every year for the past four decades. To the contrary, while sanctions succeeded in bending the regime enough to get it back to the negotiating table, it had become clear they could not break it.The Iranian regime is nothing if not resilient. It fought an eight-year-long war with Iraq to a draw despite losing hundreds of thousands of lives; it has survived decades of isolation.Meanwhile, Tehran had invested its national pride and an estimated $100 billion in its nuclear program. The regime was not about to give up on those investments, even though international sanctions painstakingly built by the Obama administration cost it some $150 billion. In fact, at the time the nuclear deal was negotiated, Iran was on the threshold of becoming a nuclear state with the ability to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a weapon in a matter of weeks. The J.C.P.O.A. pushed that “breakout time” to more than a year.Next, Mr. Trump trotted out the canard that the deal gave Iran “over $100 billion its government could use to fund terrorism.” Never mind that the money in question is actually Iran’s — the proceeds from oil sales that countries around the world froze in bank accounts at the United States’ behest — or that virtually all of it is being dedicated to unmet domestic needs, to pay off debts and to prop up Iran’s currency.As to Iran’s nuclear obligations under the agreement, Mr. Trump asserted that “we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran’s path to a bomb.” This will be news to the I.A.E.A., which now benefits from the most intrusive and transparent inspection and monitoring regime ever devised. Its major provisions last 20 to 25 years, and under the Additional Protocol that Iran is obliged to adopt under the agreement, the I.A.E.A. will have the right to access declared and undeclared sites in perpetuity, including Iran’s military facilities.And that “short term” delay in Iran’s race to a bomb? Mr. Trump ignored the fact that while certain constraints on Iran’s enrichment capacity go away in 10 or 15 years, it is permanently barred under the Non-Proliferation Treaty from acquiring a nuclear weapon or doing weapons-related work. If Iran nonetheless moves in that direction, thanks to the inspection regime a future president will have a much greater likelihood of seeing it and a united international community to confront it — both of which the United States will lose if it reneges on the deal.Now that Mr. Trump has decertified Iran’s compliance with the nuclear agreement, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. Mr. Trump called on Congress and America’s allies to use the time “to address the deal’s many serious flaws.” If not, he said, “the agreement will be terminated.”By “fix” Mr. Trump means legislation to impose new conditions on Iran beyond the purview of the agreement and to extend its constraints indefinitely. That would put the United States, not Iran, in violation of the agreement and isolate Washington, not Tehran, around the world. It would allow Iran to resume its pursuit of nuclear weapons or to stick with the deal for its economic benefits, forcing the United States to sanction its closest allies for doing business with Tehran. It would provide a “we told you so” gift to Iranian hard-liners in their struggle with pragmatists. It would shackle, not advance, Mr. Trump’s ability to sign others on to his broader strategy to confront Iranian aggression. More broadly, it would undermine America’s credibility — and its ability to strike agreements that make the country safer in the future.Congress must resist the temptation — and the political pressure — to unilaterally renegotiate the Iran deal and therefore kill it. Instead, it could usefully lay out what Mr. Trump’s speech did not: an actual comprehensive strategy to contend with Iran’s non-nuclear behavior, including diplomatic efforts to end the conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Iraq that Iran exploits; stronger security cooperation with the Gulf States and Israel; better coordination with America’s allies; and targeted sanctions on Iran that do not violate the nuclear accord. Unlike Mr. Trump’s decision to decertify Iran, that would be a real contribution to America’s security.', 'Farhad and Nicole’s Week in Tech: Russia, Russia Everywhere - The New York TimesEach Friday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Mike is off this week, so Nicole Perlroth, who covers cybersecurity, took his place. Farhad: O.K., it was a big week in tech. We should probably start with the thing we’ve been talking about every week for, what, 300 years now? Facebook and Russia. In a report this week, a couple of our colleagues found that when Russian operatives set out to sow civil unrest in America on Facebook, they turned to an obvious source — political messages posted by Americans.The Russians created Facebook pages that had names like “Being Patriotic” and “Blacktivist,” and they populated their pages with videos and memes created by Americans — for instance, a hoax story about Muslim men collecting welfare checks for multiple wives. I found the story fascinating because the whole thing is so banal. You have this picture of foreign spies using James Bond-type technology to go after an enemy’s political system. Nope, turns out they went about it exactly how you or I might do it — they found some videos online and posted them on Facebook.Nicole: Yup. It turns out the Kremlin has found their sweet spot in the ugly fault lines in American politics. They’ve truly exploited our country’s political grievances, cultural resentments, news literacy and diminishing faith in once-trusted institutions like the news media to bring out the worst in us, simply by creating some Facebook pages. Who would have thought that Russians would be behind a pro-Texas fan page disseminating pro-secessionist Texas messages, or a “Blacktivist” page advocating for more protests against racial inequality?Farhad: It wasn’t just Facebook. Google disclosed this week that Russian operatives also bought ads on its platform to interfere with the 2016 race. The amounts were small — about $4,700 in ads from the Russian government — but they added to the overall story line, which is that the tech giants’ platforms are being used in ways they probably had never foreseen.Nicole:  Did we really think Russia was going to try to hack election databases in 21 states, and pour that many resources into Facebook and not touch Google, the No. 1 source of information for most Americans?It’s frustrating that this is only coming out now, but to be fair, much of the Russian activity was not exactly obvious. The silver lining is that we may finally be getting some answers. This week, the House Intelligence Committee said it would turn over Russian Facebook ad content, after meeting with Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.Farhad: Let’s turn to another story about Russian spies, this one not at all banal. The United States recently discovered that a Russian antivirus company, Kaspersky Lab, had been compromised by the Russian government. The software was essentially being used as a kind of search engine for spying — the Russians could search through the files of people who’d installed the software, and in some cases it led them to classified documents, including from an employee of the National Security Agency who had stored files on a home computer.That’s pretty amazing by itself. But what was most amazing was how the spying was discovered — because Israeli spies were watching the Russians spy on the Americans, as you and Scott Shane reported. That’s crazy! Can you explain how it went down?Nicole: My reporting can basically be summed up as: Spies were spying on spies spying on spies’ spying. Are you with me?Farhad: Er….Nicole: So in 2014, the Israeli government hackers managed to compromise Kaspersky Lab, a Russian antivirus company with 400 million users, many of them in Western Europe and the United States.Here I should mention that some two dozen American federal agencies used Kaspersky’s software, including some of the most critical agencies like the Department of Energy, which oversees our nuclear program. Kaspersky was so thoroughly “owned” by the Israelis, that nearly a year later when Kaspersky’s researchers discovered the intrusion, its own researchers called the Israeli attack code “the best we have ever seen.”As it turns out, the Israelis were so deep inside Kaspersky’s systems that they watched — in real time — as Russian spies used Kaspersky’s systems effectively as a Google search box for American classified government programs. The Israelis caught Russian spies searching any computer that contained Kaspersky’s software for the words “Top Secret,” in a sense abusing Kaspersky’s deep access to the innards of more than 400 million people’s machines to search for American government classified programs.In at least one case, the spies struck gold: They discovered a trove of highly classified National Security Agency programs on an agency employee’s personal computer. Apparently the employee had installed the Kaspersky software on his home computer, not knowing that in doing so he was giving Russians full access to some of the N.S.A.’s most coveted programs for penetrating foreign networks.Israel was able to capture all of this in real time and provided the N.S.A. with evidence in the forms of screenshots and other documentation, which is how the N.S.A. learned the source of this particular leak. The tip also prompted tons of internal discussions and studies within the United States intelligence community, which eventually led to a government ban on Kaspersky products last month.Farhad: Kaspersky is a real mystery in this. They’ve denied any wrongdoing, but is it plausible that they wouldn’t have had an idea that their tools had been infiltrated by the Russian government?Nicole: This is the mystery indeed. I sent Kaspersky a detailed list of questions that gave them ample opportunity to offer any explanations. But they declined to answer any of those questions. Instead they put out a short vague statement and sent me a Rihanna GIF on Twitter.There are still some possible technical explanations for how Russia could have used Kaspersky as a backdoor without Kaspersky’s knowledge. But most counterintelligence experts, including one we quoted from the Central Intelligence Agency, insist there is no way these kinds of broad scans for United States intelligence could have been conducted without Kaspersky’s knowledge.And even if Kaspersky was not complicit, these experts say, that would still mean Kaspersky is either grossly incompetent or horrendously compromised. As a security company, neither is optimal.Farhad: That’s been quite the week! Thanks for joining me, Nicole. See you!Nicole: Ciao!

This difficulty in isolating specific people — really seeing them as sovereign beings rather than as an undifferentiated mass — is crucial to the meaning of the documentary, which charts the global refugee and migrant crisis. Shot over the course of one year in 23 countries, the movie tracks the here and there of people whose relentless ebbing and flowing make startlingly visible what news headlines repeatedly suggest: that ours is an age of ceaseless churn with no calm in sight.A Chinese dissident now living in Berlin, Mr. Ai is a major art-world figure who’s had a more modest cinematic profile until now. He’s directed other nonfiction titles, and is the subject of Alison Klayman’s very fine feature documentary, “Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry,” which was shot when he was still living in China. Although Mr. Ai occasionally shows up in “Human Flow,” in oblique glimpses and hovering at the edges of the frame, he plays an appropriately discreet role in his own documentary. In one scene, he walks along a waterfront where refugees are arriving by boat; elsewhere, he comforts a distraught woman and, to his credit, makes the scene about her and not him.Mr. Ai’s ambition in “Human Flow” is as expansive as his reach and his apparently deep-pocketed resources. (More than 200 crew members, including a half-dozen drone operators, were involved in this worldwide journey.) Some documentaries find multitudes in fixed locations, as is the case with Gianfranco Rosi’s “Fire at Sea,” about an Italian island that’s become a destination for African, Asian and Middle Eastern refugees. Mr. Ai instead takes an ambulatory approach and wanders the globe, traveling to Africa (Kenya), Southeast Asia (Malaysia) and the Middle East (Israel, Jordan) as well as to North America and many ports of call throughout Europe.“Human Flow” opens and closes with aquatically themed imagery, beginning with a shot of a deep, dazzlingly blue body of water. It’s a soothing, almost meditative vision as well as a seductive dream of nature as a balm and refuge. This pacific picture, though, is soon replaced by far more disturbing, recurrent images of perilously small boats filled with frantically shouting, gesturing men, women and children seeking asylum. In one makeshift port and then another there is splashing and disembarking and then cries and hugs as babies are gingerly passed from hand to hand. It’s a distressing, familiar scene in some ways, one that has been playing on our televisions for years.What Mr. Ai seeks is to go far beyond the nightly news; he wants to give you a sense of the scale of the crisis, its terrifying, world-swallowing immensity. And so he jumps from one heartbreak to the next, passes through Gaza, drops into Pakistan, spends time in Turkey and ambles along the border separating (somewhat) Mexico and the United States, where an American border guard rather ridiculously tries to explain where Mr. Ai can and cannot go. Mr. Ai also visits a number of refugee camps that range from the squalid to the unimaginable and, as he does throughout, he shows you both the dignity and the misery at street level before using drones to soar over the camps.These drone views help give “Human Flow” a velvety smooth look that is occasionally punctuated by jagged cellphone images, at least some of which Mr. Ai seems to have shot. Drone visuals can come off as faddish, gimmicky, but the airborne material here consistently puts Mr. Ai’s ideas into pure, visual terms. He incorporates reams of information in the movie, sometimes through interviews or through data that crawls along the screen, ticker-tape style. Every so often, he folds in an elegant or haunting quote, giving you something to think about as the camera shows a world in which, step by step, crisis by crisis, borders have become by turns absurd and immaterial.', 'A Trove of Yiddish Artifacts Rescued From the Nazis, and Oblivion - The New York TimesIn one of their odder and more chilling moves, the Nazis occupying Lithuania once collected Yiddish and Hebrew books and documents, hoping to create a reference collection about a people they intended to annihilate.Even stranger, they appointed Jewish intellectuals and poets to select the choicest pearls for study.These workers, assigned to sift through a major Jewish library in Vilna, Vilnius in Lithuanian, ended up hiding thousands of books and papers from the Nazis, smuggling them out under their clothing, and squirreling them away in attics and underground bunkers.In 1991, a large part of the collection was found in the basement of a Vilnius church, and were hailed as important artifacts of Jewish history.But months ago curators at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in Manhattan, the successor to the Vilnius library, were told that another trove, totaling 170,000 pages, had been found, somehow overlooked in the same church basement.These documents, experts say, are even more valuable and compelling. Among the finds:• Five dog-eared notebooks of poetry by Chaim Grade, considered along with Isaac Bashevis Singer as one of the leading Yiddish novelists of the mid-20th century.• Two letters by Sholem Aleichem, the storyteller whose tales of Tevye the Milkman formed the core of “Fiddler on the Roof.”• A postcard written by Marc Chagall, the Jewish modernist painter.“These are gold,” said David E. Fishman, a professor of Jewish history at the Jewish Theological Seminary, who traveled to Vilnius in July at YIVO’s behest to assess the trove’s importance. He came back with the sort of enthusiasm one might find in an explorer who has just discovered unknown lands.A selection of 10 items from the newly found literary manuscripts, letters, diaries, synagogue record books, theater posters and ephemera will go on display on Oct. 24 at YIVO headquarters on West 16th Street.In interviews, Mr. Fishman and Jonathan Brent, YIVO’s executive director, discussed other findings, including, an early poem by Abraham Goldfaden, the father of the flourishing Yiddish theater in Europe and on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, and 10 poems handwritten in the Vilna ghetto by Abraham Sutzkever, among the greatest Yiddish poets. In one poem, Sutzkever expresses his fear that “Death is rushing, riding on a bullet-head/To tear apart in me my brightest dream.”Mr. Brent and his staff said they were just as excited by more quotidian items like scripts of “Sherlock Holmes” and other popular entertainments that delighted prewar Jews and an astronomical guide with a set of dials to calculate when religious holidays should fall, given variations in the lengths of Jewish lunar months. A 1933 “autobiography” by a malnourished fifth grader, Bebe Epshtein, describes how her parents forced her to eat by telling her beguiling stories. When “I would open my mouth,” she wrote, “they would pour in food.”Many of the items, the experts said, offer glimpses into the hardscrabble everyday lives of the Jews of Eastern Europe when the region, not Israel or the Lower East Side, was the center of the Jewish world.Almost as intriguing as the cache is the serpentine story of the documents’ rescue and rediscovery, much of which had been known before but which has been updated with the new find.When the Nazis occupied Lithuania from 1941 to 1944, they were determined to incinerate or grind up the country’s Jewish collections, particularly those at YIVO, which from 1925 to 1940 in Vilna was the world’s foremost library of Jewish life in Eastern Europe. With characteristic incongruity, though, they decided to save a third of the YIVO collection for a research center near Frankfurt that would study “the Jewish question” even if they planned to make sure the Jews would be extinct. (In Lithuania alone, 90 percent of the prewar Jewish population of 160,000 was murdered.)They needed Yiddish speakers to analyze and select the materials, and deployed 40 ghetto residents like Sutzkever and another raffish poet, Shmerke Kaczerginski, as slave laborers. Risking death by a firing squad, this “paper brigade” rescued thousands of books and documents.When the Germans were pushed out of Lithuania by the Soviets, survivors like Sutzkever spirited some hidden treasures to New York. (The Soviets frowned on anything evocative of ethnic or religious loyalties.) Meanwhile, a gentile librarian, Antanas Ulpis, who was assembling the remnants of the national library in a former church, St. George’s, stashed stacks of Jewish materials in basement rooms to hide them from Stalin’s enforcers. He is, as a result, regarded by YIVO as a kind of Oskar Schindler of document rescue.The bulk of the basement collection — documents totaling 250,000 pages — was recovered after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.Last year, the entire basement collection was transferred to the Martynas Mazvydas National Library of Lithuania, which had reopened in a grand colonnaded building, and in May officials there informed Mr. Brent, of the new trove of 170,000 documents. They had been stored in a separate church basement room and had never been evaluated because none of the assigned archivists could read Yiddish or Hebrew.Lithuania has chosen to hold onto all the Jewish documents in the library’s Judaica center as part of its national heritage. But it has allowed YIVO to digitize them for the use of the general public — and to have select items to display in Manhattan later this month.“It’s going to take decades for scholars to analyze all of this,” said Mr. Fishman, who this month published “The Book Smugglers: Partisans, Poets and the Race to Save Jewish Treasures From the Nazis.”Among the more mundane curiosities that were salvaged is a weathered agreement from 1857 between a yeshiva in Vilna and a union of water carriers.What is a water carrier, a Talmud student might ask?In Vilna at that time, water carriers were needed to deliver buckets of water to homes from available wells. The ragtag Jewish water carriers formed a guild, which promised to donate a Torah scroll and a set of Talmuds to the yeshiva if members were given a room of their own, rent-free, for worship.The crew that rescued these records largely did not survive the war. Some 34 of the 40 people viewed by experts as having been members of the “paper brigade” died, according to Mr. Fishman, some in death camps like Treblinka or in labor camps or in more random fashion. Mr. Kaczerginski was killed in 1954 in a plane crash in the Andes. Sutzkever had an illustrious career as a poet in Israel and died at age 96 in 2010. Mr. Ulpis, who helped save the documents later found in the church basement, died in 1981.', 'Forget Marx and Mao. Chinese City Honors Once-Banned Confucian. - The New York TimesGUIYANG, China — Nearly 500 years after he died, the Chinese philosopher Wang Yangming once again wielded a calligraphy brush, carefully daubed it into a tray of black ink and elegantly wrote out his most famous phrase: “the unity of knowledge and action.”A crowd murmured its approval as his assistant held up the paper for all to see.“I respect Wang Yangming from the bottom of my heart!” blurted Cao Lin, 69, a retiree.Watching the scene unfold was Zhou Ying, who manages Wang — or at least a very realistic robot that not only looks like Wang but is able to imitate his calligraphy and repeat more than 1,000 of his aphorisms.“This is exactly what we’re hoping to achieve with the robot,” Ms. Zhou said as Wang began writing another saying. “We feel this is a way to get people interested in these old ideas.”Promoting these old ideas has been a priority for President Xi Jinping, who has rekindled enthusiasm for traditional culture as part of a broader push to fill what many Chinese see as their country’s biggest problem: a spiritual void caused by its headlong pursuit of prosperity.And when China’s most powerful leader in 40 years endorses a philosopher, even a long-dead Confucian one, people rush to take action.The epicenter of Wang’s revival has been this city of four million people perched on a plateau in China’s mountainous south. When Wang spent three years in exile here in the early 16th century, Guiyang was a remote outpost on imperial China’s southern border.Today, as the capital of one of China’s poorest provinces, it has high-speed rail service to the coast and is trying to position itself as a center of big data — and traditional culture.Since Mr. Xi began promoting the philosopher three years ago, officials in and around Guiyang have built a Wang Yangming-themed park, constructed a museum to showcase his achievements, turned a small cave into a shrine in his honor and, yes, commissioned a robot to bring him to life.“It’s a way to promote moral behavior in society as a whole,” said Larry Israel, a scholar at Middle Georgia State University in Macon who has written about the revival.Restoring a sense of public morality has been a policy goal of Mr. Xi, who is set to be reappointed as Communist Party leader at the party’s 19th congress starting Wednesday.In his efforts to address the country’s spiritual shortcomings, Mr. Xi has spoken favorably of Confucius, praised Buddhism and presided over a revival of traditional religious practices that were once condemned as superstitious.But he has seemed most comfortable praising the life and works of Wang Yangming.Born in 1472, Wang was a scholar with a promising career in the imperial court in Beijing when, in 1506, he spoke out against the cruelty of a well-known courtier. That offense earned him banishment to faraway Guiyang.During his years here, Wang ran a post house on the edge of town. That gave him time to meditate on the philosophical problem that would define his legacy: understanding how people know right from wrong. His conclusion: People have an inborn conscience that they must act upon, regardless of the consequences.It was this advocacy of moral action that apparently appeals to the no-nonsense Mr. Xi, who has cracked down on vice and corruption within the party’s ranks. Mr. Xi frequently refers to Wang, who regained favor in 1509, and then loyally served the emperor as a military leader who quashed a rebellion.However, some see Wang, with his emphasis on following one’s internal moral compass, as a risky thinker for an authoritarian state to embrace.“Wang Yangming can pave the way for a philosophy of autonomy — that standards don’t come from outside. that they are inner,” said Sébastien Billioud, co-author of a recent book on Confucian thought in today’s China. “And of course autonomy is always dangerous for authoritarian regimes.”During the first decades of communist rule, Wang’s works were banned as “bourgeois.” Even into the 1990s, it was still risky to talk about him at academic conferences.“We held small private meetings” to discuss Wang, recalled Zhang Xinmin, a philosophy professor at Guizhou University on the city’s outskirts. “We were monitored the whole time,” he said.The ban on Wang began to lift around 2000 with a revival in the popularity of Confucian studies. Then, in 2014, Mr. Xi explicitly told local leaders to promote Wang’s thoughts. Suddenly, Wang Yangming was China’s hottest philosopher since Marx.“It was completely unexpected,” Professor Zhang said.Wang’s rehabilitation has turned Guiyang into a hive of activity. One reason is that until a recent promotion, the province was led by one of Mr. Xi’s protégés, Chen Min’er.Mr. Chen’s loyalty is on display at the Guiyang Confucius Academy, a vast complex of museums, fountains, dioramas and lecture halls on the city’s outskirts. When it opened in 2013, it made little mention of Wang. But now there is a museum devoted to him nearly as big as the hall to Confucius himself.“Both Uncle Xi and Chen Min’er love him,” said Xu Qi, the party official in charge of the museum.Guiyang’s embrace of Wang can also show how much work Mr. Xi still has before him.On the city’s north side is the Yangming Cave, where Wang taught and whose name he adopted as his own. (His name at birth was Wang Shouren.) The cave is now encircled by a cultural park that is the centerpiece of a 600-acre real estate project of luxury high-rises and malls.A senior local official, who asked not to be identified because of the delicacy of the issue, said the project was being investigated for corruption. When asked what he intended to do about it, however, his answer didn’t seem exactly in keeping with Wang’s advocacy of independent moral action.“We are waiting,” he said, “until after the 19th Party congress to see how to proceed.”', 'Lights, Camera and, Yes, Music: Reporting From the Operating Room as Doctors Perform Fetal Surgery - The New York Times“She wants Eric Church on the Pandora,” Dr. Michael Belfort told the team that was preparing a woman for surgery at Texas Children’s Hospital, in Houston.The country music fan was Lexi Royer, who, 24 weeks and two days pregnant, was about to have her belly sliced open and her uterus lifted out (though still attached internally). It would then be drained of amniotic fluid, pumped full of carbon dioxide and pierced so tiny slits could admit a light, a camera and surgical tools.The tools would be used to repair a severe spinal defect — spina bifida — in her unborn son. It is a disabling condition, and the hope was that the operation would give him better odds of being able to walk and avoiding fluid buildup in his brain.In a few decades of reporting on medicine, I had been in the O.R. during brain surgery, cesarean sections, liver transplants, cardiac bypass, an eyeball cut out of its socket — but never an operation on a fetus.I learned about this one when I contacted Dr. Belfort about a YouTube video in which he described the need for tiny tools to operate on fetuses. He’s got a book full of his own detailed drawings — a cross between Leonardo and Rube Goldberg — of instruments he wants made. In our conversation he mentioned spina bifida surgery, and I wanted to see it. Permission was not immediate: Doctors, patients and hospital officials had to consent. Once they agreed, a public relations person was assigned to accompany me and a photographer in the operating room.Before the operation started, one of the surgeons who would assist, Dr. Oluyinka O. Olutoye, shared a sobering thought about the potential risks of performing surgery on two patients at once. “Fetal surgery,” he said, “is one of the few operations with a 200 percent risk of mortality.”Operating rooms are usually kept cool, almost chilly. But not for fetal surgery. If the temperature is too low, the fetus’s heartbeat can slow down too much, so this operating room was pretty hot. When the photographer, Béatrice de Géa, and I were changing into scrubs in the women’s locker room, a nurse warned, “It’s going to be like a sauna in there.”It was crowded, too. Besides Dr. Belfort and a pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. William Whitehead, there were two anesthesiologists, a pediatric cardiologist and two doctors who would steady the uterus and help to gently hold the fetus in position, as well as several nurses.For reporters in the operating room, the job is to see what’s going on, stay out of the way and not touch — or even get near — anything draped in blue, which is the sterile stuff. It’s O.K. to look over the surgeons’ shoulders as long as you don’t brush their gowns. And the reporter has to stay out of the photographs, too.In this case there were amazing views of the surgery, on three flat screens that showed images from the camera inside the uterus. Because the doctors were operating through the tiny slits, they needed those images to see what they were doing.People often ask if I’ve ever felt sick or faint in an operating room. So far, no: What’s going on is invariably so interesting, and I’m so caught up in trying to understand it, that squeamishness just doesn’t happen. I don’t like the smell: Surgeons seem to cauterize everything they cut, and burning flesh has an acrid odor, but either it doesn’t last or my nose gets used to it.At 9:28 that Tuesday morning, the soft Pandora music had moved on from Eric Church to Neil Young’s “Harvest Moon,” and he was singing, “I want to see you dance again,” as Mrs. Royer’s son came into view. He seemed to be kneeling inside her womb; we could see his bottom and the soles of his feet, impossibly small.The operation was an endurance test for the surgeons. They stood shoulder to shoulder for hours, hands and arms in the air as they worked through the slits, painstakingly snipping tissue, stretching it over the open spine and stitching it shut to make a watertight seal. The spinal defect was so big that there seemed barely enough skin to cover it, and it was painful to watch it being tugged into place.The room was so hot that I took off a gown I’d been given to put over my scrubs, and I found a chair to sit in periodically, to give my legs a break. There were no breaks for the surgeons.Israel Kamakawiwoʻole was singing “Over the Rainbow” as the last stitch went into the fetus. By noon, the surgeons were done.“I sweat like hell,” Dr. Belfort said, peeling his gloves off pale waterlogged hands that looked as if they’d spent too long in the bath.Mrs. Royer’s husband, Joshuwa, his mother and Mrs. Royer’s parents were waiting anxiously, and crowded into a small room when Dr. Belfort arrived.“Everything went very well, so you can relax,” he said, showing them pictures of the fetus’s back, before and after. “So far, so good. Now we have to hope and pray she doesn’t go into preterm labor.”Mr. Royer was stoic, but the parents, the reporter and the photographer all burst into tears and hugged one another.Later, Mrs. Royer’s mother, Raquel Bourgeois, said the family understood that the operation was not a cure, and that her grandson would almost certainly have some degree of disability.“But we’re strong believers in God, and we’re at peace,” Mrs. Bourgeois said. “This baby is going to be so loved. We just don’t care.”She went on: “Lexi and Josh are very strong together. This is not going to break them. They are the best possible parents for this child in this situation.”I am wishing the best for Mrs. and Mr. Royer and their son, and I hope to report on how they’re all doing after he’s born.', 'DOHA, Qatar – As U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visits the Middle East this weekend, he\'ll hope to achieve something that has eluded top American diplomats for a generation: sealing a new alliance between Saudi Arabia and Iraq that would shut the doors of the Arab world to neighboring Iran.While the United States strives to heal the rift between the Gulf Arab states and Qatar, and resolve civil wars in Yemen and Syria, Tillerson is the Trump administration\'s point man on an even more ambitious and perhaps even less likely geopolitical gambit.U.S. officials see a new axis that unites Riyadh and Baghdad as central to countering Iran\'s growing influence from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea, particularly as the Iraqi government struggles to rebuild recently liberated Islamic State strongholds and confronts a newly assertive Kurdish independence movement.History, religion and lots of politics stand in Tillerson\'s way. He arrived in Riyadh on Saturday and planned to visit Qatar on Monday.The effort to wean Iraq from Iran and bond it to Saudi Arabia isn\'t new, but U.S. officials are optimistically pointing to a surer footing they believe they\'ve seen in recent months. They\'re hoping to push the improved relations into a more advanced phase Sunday when Tillerson participates in the inaugural meeting of the Saudi Arabia-Iraq Coordination Committee in Riyadh.Tillerson will seek Saudi financial generosity and political support for Iraq, its embattled northern neighbor. Two U.S. officials said Tillerson hopes the oil-rich Saudis will contribute to the massive reconstruction projects needed to restore pre-IS life in Iraqi cities such as Mosul and lend their backing to Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. He is treading delicately among a host of powerful countries on Iraq\'s borders which are increasingly trying to shape the future of the ethnically and religiously divided nation.The officials briefed reporters on condition of anonymity because they weren\'t authorized to publicly preview Tillerson\'s plans.Shiite-majority Iraq and Sunni-led Saudi Arabia, estranged for decades after Saddam Hussein\'s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, have tried in recent years to bridge their differences.Nevertheless, the relationship is still plagued by suspicion.Saudi Arabia reopened its embassy in Baghdad in 2015 after a quarter-century, and earlier this year unblocked long-closed border crossings. But the emergence of arch-Saudi rival Iran as a power player in Iraq continues to gnaw at Riyadh and Washington.Iran\'s reported intervention in Iraq\'s semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region, following last month\'s much criticized vote for independence in a referendum, has deepened the unease.President Donald Trump wants to see "a stable Iraq, but a stable Iraq that is not aligned with Iran," H.R. McMaster, his national security adviser, said this past week. He suggested Saudi Arabia could play a pivotal role.The U.S. view is that the alternative may mean more conflict in Iraq, which endured years of insurgency after the U.S.-led 2003 invasion and ethnic warfare when the Islamic State group rampaged across the country in 2014."Iran is very good at pitting communities against each other," McMaster said Thursday at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "This is something they share with groups like ISIS, with al-Qaida. They pit communities against each other because they use tribal and ethnic and sectarian conflicts to gain influence by portraying themselves as a patron or protector of one of the parties in the conflict and then they use that invitation to come in and to help to advance their agenda and, in Iran\'s case, I think is a hegemonic design."Trump and his national security team have framed much of the Middle East security agenda around counteracting Iran, which they see as a malign influence that poses an existential threat to Israel and other American allies and partners in the region. They also accuse Iran of menacing the United States and its interests at home and elsewhere in the world.Shortly after taking office, Tillerson identified improving Saudi-Iraqi ties as a priority in the administration\'s broader policy to confront and contain Iran. Officials say he has devoted himself to the effort.On his second official trip abroad, Tillerson in February canceled a planned "meet and greet" with staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City to focus on the matter, according to one of the officials who previewed Tillerson\'s current trip.Tillerson\'s decision to skip that gathering was widely criticized at the time as a sign of disengagement with his employees, but the official said Tillerson adjusted plans to speak by secure telephone to Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on the Iraq rapprochement.Tillerson, according to the official, implored al-Jubeir to visit Baghdad as a sign of Saudi goodwill and commitment to the effort to defeat IS, which then still held about half of Mosul.Al-Jubeir agreed. Two days later, he made a surprise trip to the Iraqi capital. He was the first Saudi foreign minister to do so in 27 years.', 'For Nikki Haley, an Establishment Tutorial in Statecraft - The New York TimesAt various points, in different eras, they sat across from dictators and kings and ministers, negotiating on behalf of their country. But when former secretaries of state Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine K. Albright took the stage together this week, they focused their diplomacy on a target closer to home — the Trump administration.During a panel discussion in New York, the cabinet veterans, one Republican and one Democrat, sought to school Nikki R. Haley, the rising star ambassador to the United Nations, on the importance of the State Department budget, the threat posed by Russia, the best way to reform the United Nations and the virtues of nation building, international trade and a free press.Gently, politely but insistently, they offered an establishment tutorial on statecraft for an administration that has disdained the very notion. The discussion was friendly and hardly confrontational, yet it felt like a deposed order seeking to influence the revolutionaries who toppled it. In Ms. Haley, they coached the figure seemingly most sympathetic to the traditional ways of doing business — not to mention the one who may assume their old job soon enough.As a Democrat who served under President Bill Clinton, Ms. Albright felt freer to be direct. “Nation building is not a four-letter word,” she told Ms. Haley at one point.“I think also that we have to be very protective of our press,” she said at another. “Our democracy depends on having a free press.”A former ambassador to the United Nations herself, Ms. Albright also offered firsthand advice about how to handle the world body. “If funding for the United Nations is cut and you go and try to work on reform, you are not going to be listened to because you don’t have the leverage,” she said. “It happened to me.”Ms. Rice, while more cautious addressing her fellow Republican, urged Ms. Haley to stress the value of international cooperation — not just the drawbacks. She pointed to the Trump administration’s recent decision to withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations cultural organization, citing its “anti-Israel bias.” Ms. Rice was President George W. Bush’s national security adviser in 2002 when the United States rejoined Unesco.“You won’t get an argument from me” about pulling out again, Ms. Rice said. “But you have to affirm the things that have worked too, because if you lead with what doesn’t work, that’s all people hear at home and abroad. So I would just hope it could be recalibrated.”The panel on Thursday was a discussion of American leadership sponsored by Mr. Bush’s presidential center. In the end, it was overshadowed by a speech by the former president that sounded like a rebuke of President Trump and the forces that brought him to power. Ms. Haley was the only senior Trump administration official at the conference and she left before Mr. Bush spoke.The conference focused on defending democratic and free-market principles at a time when they appear under siege both in the United States and abroad. It brought together Republicans and Democrats in what seemed almost like a meeting of the exiled bipartisan order, sharing their anxiety about Mr. Trump’s leadership in the world.Ms. Haley, a former governor of South Carolina with no significant foreign policy experience before being sent to the United Nations, has become one of the highest profile members of Mr. Trump’s team and a possible successor to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, whose strained relationship with the president has made him something of a dead man walking.At times during her tenure, Ms. Haley has spoken off the official administration script, expressing sentiments more in keeping with her predecessors from both parties. But at other times, she has been Mr. Trump’s explainer and defender to the world even as he pulls out of international agreements and seeks to slash the American diplomatic corps.At this week’s conference, Ms. Haley, 45, sat between Ms. Rice, 62, and Ms. Albright, 80, and gave the impression of welcoming advice from mentors. She smiled and nodded at some points when one secretary or the other urged her to take a course different than the one favored by the administration.Ms. Rice expressed confidence afterward that the encounter had been useful. “I thought it was a very good exchange,” she said in an email, “and it did show bipartisan support for the importance of American diplomacy and for proper resourcing of the tools to carry it out.”Ms. Rice and Ms. Albright were particularly eager to press Ms. Haley to resist Mr. Trump’s proposals to slash the State Department budget by nearly 30 percent, eviscerating the diplomatic corps. Ms. Rice noted that fighting AIDS, supporting women’s groups and financing election monitoring go a long way toward advancing American interests.“The difference between the budget for the Pentagon, over $600 billion, and for the State Department, under $50 billion at the moment, is crazy,” Ms. Albright said. “We do not have a lot of tools. It is necessary to have a functioning diplomatic service.”Ms. Haley reassured the former secretaries, asserting that Mr. Trump did not necessarily mean for his proposed cuts to actually be enacted. “It was just his conversation point,” she said. “He was starting a conversation.”She likewise played down the possibility that Mr. Trump would simply rip up trade agreements, saying he merely wanted to improve them. “There’s nothing wrong with going back and saying, ‘Can we make them better,’” Ms. Haley said. “I don’t see us tearing up any deals. If we were going to do that, we would have done that already.”One area where the two secretaries were clearly preaching to the choir was Russia’s intervention in last year’s presidential election. Ms. Rice, a longtime Russia scholar, said the intervention was “highly sophisticated” and that she hoped “we are on top of what really happened” because it could happen again. “My own view is if they do this to us once, it’s their fault,” she said. “If they do this to us twice, it’s ours.”Unlike her boss, who has dismissed the Russia intervention as a “hoax” perpetrated by Democrats and the news media, Ms. Haley agreed that it was serious. “The Russians, God bless them, they’re saying, ‘Why are Americans anti-Russian and why have we done the sanctions?’” she said. “Well, don’t interfere in our elections and we won’t be anti-Russian.”“When a country can come interfere in another country’s elections, that is warfare,” she added. “This is their new weapon of choice and we have to make sure we get in front of it.”Ms. Rice and Ms. Albright seemed satisfied. On this, at least, they were all on the same page.', 'Middle East Feud Looms Over Jailing of Egyptian Woman - The New York TimesCAIRO — Confined to a tiny windowless cell without a mattress or a toilet, denied visitors and held in solitary for months on end, Ola al-Qaradawi is being subjected to harsh treatment even by the grim standards of Egyptian prisons.Ms. Qaradawi, 55, was arrested in June when national security officers swooped in on her family’s summer villa on the Mediterranean coast. Since then, her lawyers say, she has been denied the most basic privileges, and is allowed a single, five-minute bathroom break every morning.What crime merits such tough conditions is unclear. The Egyptian authorities have yet to formally charge Ms. Qaradawi, who works in an embassy and is a permanent American resident, or her husband, Hosam Khalaf, who is being held in similar conditions at a separate Cairo prison. State news media outlets say they are accused of belonging to the banned Muslim Brotherhood.But the true reason for Ms. Qaradawi’s punishment, supporters and human rights activists say, is more likely tied to a bruising geopolitical feud between the biggest and wealthiest countries in the Middle East, in which Ms. Qaradawi may have become a hapless pawn.“A big part of this is about Qatar,” said Aayah Khalaf, Ms. Qaradawi’s daughter.In June, four Arab countries, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, imposed a punishing air, sea and trade blockade on Qatar. Among their demands is that Qatar’s gas-rich royals halt their support for prominent Islamists like Ms. Qaradawi’s father, Yusuf.Mr. Qaradawi is one of the Arab world’s most popular televangelists. For years, his regular appearances on “Shariah and Life” on Al Jazeera attracted tens of millions of viewers. His popularity stemmed from his folksy, religiously inflected guidance on a wide range of subjects, from oral sex and the morality of lottery cards to when it is acceptable to own a dog.Mr. Qaradawi, a longtime resident of Qatar, is less popular among Western governments: Britain, the United States and some European countries have refused him visas because of his pronouncements in favor of violent attacks on American soldiers in Iraq, and in favor of suicide bombings in Israel.In television terms the bespectacled cleric, 90, is a waning force: His last broadcast was about four years ago. But he still widely viewed as the spiritual father of the Muslim Brotherhood, and his presence in Qatar is a longstanding irritation for President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.After the Egyptian military ousted the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi in 2013 as the elected president of Egypt, Mr. Qaradawi urged Egyptians to rise up against Mr. Sisi.Egypt stepped up its demand for Mr. Qaradawi’s extradition as one condition for the lifting of the anti-Qatar boycott, shortly after it was imposed in early June. Qatar’s leaders, who have a longstanding relationship with Mr. Qaradawi and have given him Qatari citizenship, refused to comply.Then, on June 30, Egyptian security forces seized his daughter and her husband, Mr. Khalaf, 58, at their vacation home on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast. The security forces raided their Cairo apartment and confiscated money, jewelry and documents. In August, the authorities froze the couple’s assets which, they said, were being used to finance the Muslim Brotherhood.Ms. Qaradawi insists she has never been active in politics, and Human Right Watch and other groups have denounced her arrest as politically motivated. While Mr. Sisi has imprisoned thousands of Brotherhood supporters since 2013, their female family members have generally been left alone. To critics, the couple’s arrest smacks of a vendetta linked to the wider Qatar crisis.“It is unbelievable that we are now living in the era of taking hostages from the families of opponents,” Mostafa al-Naggar, a former lawmaker, wrote in a Facebook post.Ms. Qaradawi and her husband were already under official scrutiny before their arrest. Mr. Khalaf was imprisoned in 2014 for his ties to a small Islamist political party, and released without charge two years later. Ms. Qaradawi is employed as a researcher at the Qatari Embassy in Cairo.They hope their status as American residents, which they obtained last year, might help persuade the White House to take up their case. Although President Trump has hailed Mr. Sisi as a “fantastic guy,” his administration in August cut or withheld $291 million in aid in response to Mr. Sisi’s woeful human rights record.Last spring, in one of his administration’s most clear-cut foreign policy achievements, Mr. Trump helped secure the release of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American aid worker imprisoned in Egypt.But the Muslim Brotherhood, never popular in Washington, is an especially tough sell right now. Mr. Trump considered designating the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization this year, holding back only on the advice of intelligence officials and diplomats.And Mr. Qaradawi, the preacher, evokes limited sympathy in policy circles even if he has been one of the most popular clerics in the Muslim world since the 1960s. In the early weeks of the Arab Spring, in 2011, Mr. Qaradawi addressed huge crowds in Cairo’s Tahrir Square. He has published over 100 books and has 1.8 million followers on Twitter.Although he denies being a member of the Brotherhood, his sermons are hugely influential in Egypt, where Mr. Sisi’s government has charged him with terrorism. Some sermons are tinged with sectarianism — he once said that Christians in Egypt have sided with the military and the West against the Brotherhood.The Egyptian prosecutor’s office did not respond to requests for comment.', 'Executive director of the Center for a Free Cuba Frank Calzon provides insight The Trump administration will defend America\'s decades-old economic embargo on Cuba in a United Nations vote this week, the State Department said Tuesday, in a reversal from the Obama administration that reflects deteriorating U.S.-Cuban relations.Every year the U.N. votes to condemn the embargo, and for years the U.S. predictably voted "no." But last year, under President Barack Obama, the U.S. abstained for the first time, as Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro moved forward with the historic warming of relations.A "no" vote Wednesday from U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley will return the United States to a place of extreme isolation within the global community over its policy toward Cuba, potentially undermining the Trump administration\'s broader goals for engagement with Latin America. The U.S. embargo on Cuba is almost universally opposed throughout the world.The vote comes as an ongoing crisis over U.S. government workers in Havana harmed by invisible "health attacks" has created a new rift between the U.S. and Cuba, putting the restoration of ties in jeopardy. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert did not mention the attacks in announcing the "no" vote, instead emphasizing the need to promote rights and democracy in Cuba."For far too long, Cuba has engaged in human rights abuses -- human rights abuses that perhaps past administrations have turned and looked the other way," Nauert said. Still, she said the U.S. would continue pursuing engagement with the island that advances American interests.General Assembly resolutions are nonbinding and unenforceable. But the annual exercise has given Cuba a global stage to demonstrate how little support America\'s commercial, economic and financial embargo enjoys.The yearly vote condemning the U.S. embargo has reliably passed overwhelmingly. Voting "no" means the U.S. will once again be pitted against almost every other nation.In 2015, the last year that the U.S. voted "no," close ally Israel was the only country to join in opposition, leading to a 191-2 vote to condemn the embargo -- the highest number of votes ever for the measure. The United States lost its only other ally in the vote, Palau, in 2013, when the Pacific island nation abstained rather than joining the U.S. in voting "no."Since taking office, Trump has taken steps to partially roll back the rapprochement with Cuba, but has preserved many other changes put in place by Obama. Yet Cuba has complained bitterly about the U.S. response to the health attacks, which has included pulling most American diplomats out of Havana and suspending visa processing for Cubans at the embassy there."To Cuba, it is unacceptable and immoral that the U.S. government has decided to take political decisions that harm the Cuban people," he said.At least 24 U.S. government workers and their spouses are "medically confirmed" to have been affected by the unexplained attacks in Havana, the State Department has said. The victims suffered a range of medical conditions including permanent hearing loss and mild traumatic brain injury, known as concussion.Cuba vehemently denies any knowledge of involvement. The U.S. has not blamed Cuba for perpetrating the attacks and says it doesn\'t know who is responsible, but has nonetheless faulted Castro\'s government for failing to keep American diplomats safe in his country.The Cuban Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the planned U.S. "no" vote.In late 2014, Obama and Castro announced plans to restore relations, and the following year embassies were re-opened in Washington and Havana more than half a century after ties were cut in 1961.Although the Obama administration eased travel and commerce restrictions on Cuba, allowing direct commercial flights between the countries to resume, Obama was unable to persuade Congress to repeal the formal embargo. The Republican-led Congress has continued to support the far-reaching sanctions.The Obama administration\'s decision last year to abstain rather than vote "no" was cheered in the 193-member General Assembly. Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. at the time, said the United States remained opposed to some of the Cuban government\'s practices and policies but was pursuing a new approach to engagement with the island.', 'Can the Saudi Crown Prince Transform the Kingdom? - The New York TimesLONDON — A new Saudi Arabia is undergoing a difficult and complicated rebirth. Two weeks before the arrest last Saturday of 11 Saudi princes, several ministers and entrepreneurs in an “anti-corruption” drive, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman organized a lavish global economic summit meeting in Riyadh to showcase his plans to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil.At the summit meeting, Prince Mohammed spoke of his plans to return Saudi Arabia to its original moderate Islam. So far his statements about moderate Islam seem to be a public relations exercise aimed at global investors.Prince Mohammed also announced a $500 billion project to build a futuristic city on the Red Sea called Neom, which he said wasn’t meant to generate jobs for Saudi citizens but to serve regional interests and global capitalism. He linked this phantasmagoria to imposing moderate Islam on the Saudi people and ridding the country of many members of the wealthy elite, including princes and their profiteering clients.Prince Mohammed described 1979 as the year when Saudi radicalization was born, as if the country had been an island of tolerance, moderation and liberal Islam earlier. That year will always be remembered for the Iranian revolution, a traumatic moment for Saudi Arabia. The founding of the Islamic Republic of Iran undermined Saudi Arabia’s claims of being the only authentic Islamic country.As Iran began to Islamize its institutions and propagate an Islamic revolutionary rhetoric abroad, the Saudis felt nervous. They consequently revived their cherished radical version of Islam, namely Wahhabism, a puritanical sectarian movement that originated in 18th-century Arabia.In 1979, Saudi Arabia’s own indigenous radical Islam unleashed its full potential when a group of so-called Unitarians seized the Mecca mosque and took hostages in protest against the government’s corruption, relations with the West, Westernization and other grievances.The House of Saud realized the volatility of the state religion. But instead of trying to de-radicalize the radicals, the regime chose to indulge them and submit to their uncompromising agenda.The Camp David agreement between Israel and Egypt in 1979 also troubled many Saudis. Consequently, Saudi Arabia together with other Arab countries boycotted Egypt under pressure from local groups.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 provided an opportunity for Saudi Arabia to outdo Iran’s Islamic republic in displaying Islamic credentials.Saudi Arabia wanted to defuse the religious radicalism at home by letting its own jihadis seek martyrdom in Afghanistan. This eventually led to the emergence of global jihad under the leadership of Osama bin Laden.Notwithstanding Prince Mohammed’s sweeping and inaccurate comments about Saudi religious moderation before 1979, it is not clear how moderate Islam is going to change the religious outlook. If he is serious about getting the country to embrace moderate Islam, he must allow Saudi clerics and thinkers of different denominations to debate foundational Islamic texts and norms in an open environment.Instead, since September, Prince Mohammed has sent hundreds of clerics, intellectuals and Islamic thinkers to prison under the pretext of fighting terrorism. Many of those detained are not radical Islamists.Saudi religious education is still based on the Wahhabi heritage and judges follow the Hanbali jurisprudence, the foundation of Wahhabi literal interpretations of Islam. The founder of Wahhabism, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, is sacrosanct. When a scholar named Hijazi Hasan Farhan al-Maliki wrote a book suggesting that readers temper their unconditional endorsement of Wahhab, he was arrested.Saudi Arabia is still the only country in the Muslim world where non-Muslim places of worship are not allowed. Even in neighboring Gulf countries, Hindu temples and Christian churches exist. The crown prince did not hint whether that would change under the new moderate Islam he envisages.Islands of openness do exist, though. Inside the walled compound in Dhahran built by the oil company Saudi Aramco for its employees, churches flourish and women drive, swim and party. This model was replicated in compounds across the country for wealthy expats, but the regime never dared to let their lifestyles spread beyond the high walls of these enclosures.Moderate Islam will not emerge in Saudi Arabia under a repressive regime whose foundation is based on purging theological difference and criminalizing the Muslim other. The regime’s main interest in religion is to gain legitimacy and pacify the Saudi population as Wahhabism justifies armed rebellion abroad against most Muslim leaders, but forbids Saudis from rising up against their own rulers.The majority of Saudi clerics are conservative Wahhabis, but in recent years some have started engaging with moderate interpretations. Before his arrest in September, Salman al-Awah, a prominent cleric with millions of followers on social media, announced that homosexuals should not be prosecuted.Sufi scholars and intellectuals in the Hijaz like the architect Sami Angawi, who documented the destruction of archaeological and religious sites in Mecca, are reluctantly tolerated, but any public display of Sufi rituals is still prohibited. The Shiites living in the oil-rich Eastern Province remain a marginalized minority, accused of being a fifth column loyal to Iran. Their jurisprudence is not represented in the Council of Higher Ulama, which advises the monarch on religious matters.Only open debate will eventually lead to a kind of Islamic modernism and shrink the spaces where fundamentalism grows. But the regime will then be left without its raison d’être, as the protector of faith, defender of Muslims and the only truly Islamic state.Prince Mohammed will need a new legitimacy narrative to sell absolute rule to the populace. Economic development and employment opportunities may be key but since the new city he’s promoting will rely more on robots than humans, there is little hope there for young Saudis in search of a livelihood.The recent announcements about moderate Islam, the pervasive arrests, and the illusory hypermodern economic projects frame him as a ruthless modernizer, who is struggling to achieve too many things in too little time. But his motive is more about the consolidation of power than about corruption.', 'Julie Banderas reports from New York City.Federal prosecutors said Wednesday that Sayfullo Saipov was "consumed by hate and a twisted ideology" when he ran down dozens of people on a New York City bike path, killing eight people and injuring 12 others.Saipov, 29, was charged with providing material support to a terrorist group and committing violence and destruction of motor vehicles in Tuesday\'s attack, in which he drove a rented Home Depot truck down the path near the World Trade Center site.Law enforcement officials described the initial charges as "holding charges," meaning that more are expected to be filed.Saipov nodded his head repeatedly as he was read his rights in a brief court proceeding that he followed through a Russian interpreter. Judge Barbara Moses set his next court date for Nov. 15.His court-appointed lawyer, David Patton, said Saipov was in "a significant amount of pain" and asked that he get wound care and a wheelchair or crutches in the federal lockup where he\'s being held without bail.Outside of court, Patton called for fair treatment of his client."I hope, given all of the attention in this case and all of the attention that it\'s sure to continue to receive, that everyone lets the judicial process play out," he said. "I promise you that how we treat Mr. Saipov in this judicial process will say a lot more about us than it will say about him."Prosecutors said Saipov had 90 videos and 3,800 photos on one of his two cellphones, many of them ISIS-related pieces of propaganda, including images of prisoners being beheaded, shot or run over by a tank.Saipov left behind knives and a note, in Arabic and English, that included Islamic religious references and said, "Islamic Supplication. It will endure," FBI agent Amber Tyree said in court papers. "It will endure" commonly refers to ISIS, Tyree said.Questioned in his hospital bed, Saipov said he had been inspired by ISIS videos that he watched on his cellphone and began plotting an attack about a year ago, deciding to use a truck about two months ago, Tyree said.Sayfullo Saipov used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out his attack on Lower Manhattan Tuesday(Courtesy Christiaan Wagener)During the last few weeks, Saipov searched the internet for information on Halloween in New York City and for truck rentals, the agent said. Saipov even rented a truck on Oct. 22 to practice making turns, and he initially hoped to get from the bike path across lower Manhattan to hit more pedestrians on the Brooklyn Bridge, Tyree said.He even considered displaying ISIS flags on the truck during the attack but decided against it because he did not want to draw attention, authorities said.John Miller, deputy New York police commissioner for intelligence, said Saipov "appears to have followed, almost exactly to a T, the instructions that ISIS has put out."In the past few years, the ISIS has exhorted followers online to use vehicles, knives or other close-at-hand means of killing people in their home countries. England, France and Germany have all seen deadly vehicle attacks since mid-2016.A November 2016 issue of the group\'s online magazine detailed features that an attack truck or van should have, suggested renting such a vehicle, and recommended targeting crowded streets and outdoor gatherings, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, a militant-monitoring agency.Carlos Batista, a neighbor of Saipov\'s in Paterson, N.J., said he had seen the suspect and two friends using the same model of rented truck several times in the past three weeks.It was not clear whether Saipov had been on authorities\' radar. Miller said Saipov had never been the subject of a criminal investigation but appears to have links to people who have been investigated.In Tuesday\'s attack, Saipov drove his speeding truck for nearly a mile along a bike path, running down cyclists and pedestrians, then crashed into a school bus, authorities said. He was shot in the abdomen after he jumped out of the vehicle brandishing two air guns, one in each hand, and yelling "Allahu Akbar."The attack killed five people from Argentina, one from Belgium and two Americans, authorities said. Of the 12 who were injured, nine remained hospitalized in serious or critical condition.Saipov lived in Ohio and Florida before moving to New Jersey around June, authorities said.Birth records show he and his wife had two daughters in Ohio, and a neighbor in New Jersey said they recently had a baby boy.Saipov was a commercial truck driver in Ohio. More recently, he was an Uber driver.In Ohio, Saipov was an argumentative young man whose career was falling apart and who was "not happy with his life," said Mirrakhmat Muminov, a fellow truck driver from heavily Muslim Uzbekistan."He had the habit of disagreeing with everybody," Muminov said.He said he and Saipov would sometimes argue about politics and world affairs, including Israel and Palestine. He said Saipov never spoke about ISIS, but he could tell his friend held radical views.Fox News\' Catherine Herridge and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.

Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. Senate Republicans are scrambling to figure out how to block Roy Moore’s path to the Senate, after accusations emerged that he made sexual advances on teenage girls when he was in his 30s.Mr. Moore, above, is the Republican nominee for the Alabama Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. A special election is scheduled for Dec. 12.He remained defiant, insisting in an interview on Fox News that he would stay in the race and denying that he “had any contact” with a woman who says he molested her when she was 14.Worried Republicans are debating fielding a write-in candidate or trying to delay the election. In an interview, Senator Mitch McConnell would not say whether he would seat Mr. Moore if he wins._____2. In political intrigue elsewhere: The mystery surrounding the resignation of Lebanon’s prime minister is fueling anxiety about whether the region is on the verge of a new conflict.After a sudden flight to Riyadh a week ago, Saad Hariri announced he was stepping down because of Iranian meddling in Lebanon through Hezbollah.He remains there, and the Saudis say there was a plot to assassinate him. The head of Hezbollah countered that Saudi Arabia had essentially kidnapped Mr. Hariri — and asked Israel to attack Lebanon. Above, a poster in Beirut that reads, “We are all Saad.”_____3. President Trump pitched an “America First” trade policy to business leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Danang, Vietnam.The remarks were strikingly hostile for the pro-trade audience, and contrasted sharply with a speech by President Xi Jinping of China that championed more robust engagement with the world.In between events, President Trump met with American veterans of the Vietnam War, above, and signed a proclamation commemorating the conflict’s 50th anniversary. He was exempted from military service during the war because of a bone spur diagnosis._____4. We published the video of our interview with Stephen Bannon, the Breitbart News chief and former strategist for President Trump, at our New York headquarters this week. Watch it here.Mr. Bannon said that Senator Mitch McConnell “has to go” and lashed out at the media’s coverage of the president. Here are the key takeaways.Jeremy Peters, the reporter who conducted the interview, will discuss it on another episode of our new podcast, “The New Washington,” out tomorrow. Click here to subscribe and hear past episodes._____5. “These stories are true.”The comedian Louis C.K. admitted that he had engaged in sexual misconduct with five women, as we reported yesterday. He expressed remorse, but did not apologize. Here’s his full statement.The release of his forthcoming comedy, “I Love You, Daddy,” was canceled by the distributor, and Netflix canceled a special with him._____6. Gov. Kenneth E. Mapp of the U.S. Virgin Islands plans to go to Washington next week to request $7 billion in aid.More than two months after Hurricanes Irma and Maria struck, many residents there are still grappling with daily survival. We checked in with people we interviewed in the intermediate aftermath of the storms.“It feels like we’re actually making a bit of progress,” said Kimmeiqua Mahoney, seated above. “But it’s still such a long, long way to go.”_____7. Dozens of young immigrants mailed in their DACA renewal forms weeks before they were due. But their paperwork was delayed in the mail — and then denied for being late.Though the Postal Service took responsibility, immigration authorities were unsympathetic: “USCIS is not responsible for the mail service an individual chooses, or for delays on the part of mail service providers,” an official said._____8. The terrible air quality in Delhi has been making headlines. Now Lahore, Pakistan’s second-largest city, is giving the Indian capital a run for its money. For nearly two weeks, Lahore has been like one huge airport smokers’ lounge.The air quality is usually bad in November, from crop burning, cold weather and higher emissions. This year it reached a crisis point, and critics say the government isn’t doing enough to address it.“Lahore looks like a dystopian wasteland right now, kind of like a scene from ‘Blade Runner,’” one local business owner said._____9. Among the panic-inducing headlines we published this week, this one stood out: “Cancer Doctors Cite Risks of Drinking Alcohol.” The American Society of Clinical Oncology had warned that even modest drinking could increase the risk of cancer. Nearly 500 readers commented on the story.“I’m waiting for the headline that reads, ‘Living Longer Causes Cancer,’” one wrote. “Because that statement would also, technically, be true.”Our colleagues at The Upshot argue it should be taken with a grain of salt, perhaps on the rim of a margarita glass._____10. Finally, Louis C.K. was supposed to be on “The Late Show” on Thursday, after the New York premiere of his new movie, “I Love You, Daddy.” But both events were canceled after we reported on his sexual misconduct.Stephen Colbert only briefly discussed the cancellation. Seth Meyers may have captured the reaction among comics best, starting his bit with a mention of the accusations against Roy Moore.“Politics is so full of perverts and deviants, I’m just so glad I work in comedy,” he said. “Aw, damn it!”Have a great weekend._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.Want to catch up on past briefings?

Bush’s administration conjured up not only terrifying images of nuclear mushroom clouds but also of Saddam Hussein plotting with Osama bin Laden to attack the United States.Mr. Bush himself declared that Mr. Hussein “aids and protects terrorists, including members of Al Qaeda” while Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld called links between Iraq and Al Qaeda “accurate and not debatable.”It wasn’t true, of course. But it helped make the case for war.That may be why a similar lie is getting trotted out again now, except this time the target is Iraq’s neighbor, Iran.On Oct. 13, in his statement decertifying the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump claimed that Tehran “provides assistance to Al Qaeda.” The following week, his C.I.A. chief, Mike Pompeo, went further: “It’s an open secret and not classified information that there have been relationships, there are connections,” Mr. Pompeo said at an event hosted by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a neoconservative think tank. “There have been times the Iranians have worked alongside Al Qaeda.”On Nov. 1, the C.I.A. released a new batch of nearly 470,000 files recovered in the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan. But the agency did more than just release the documents to the public. It provided advance copies to the foundation’s online publication, Long War Journal. (The C.I.A. said it was common practice to distribute declassified documents to the news media and academic organizations on an embargoed basis and that the only agenda in releasing these files was “to enhance public understanding” of Al Qaeda.)Long War Journal homed in on a 19-page document by an unidentified Qaeda official who claimed that the Iranian government had offered “Saudi brothers” in Al Qaeda “everything they needed,” including money, arms and training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon, “in exchange for striking American interests in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf.” Yet the Iranian offer, admitted the official, was never accepted by Al Qaeda — if such an offer was in fact made.The timing of these latest claims from the president and his C.I.A. chief are hardly coincidental. Tensions in the Middle East are ramping up. America’s chief allies in the region, Saudi Arabia and Israel, are pushing even more aggressively than usual to confront Iran. With the Obama administration gone, they have found a soul mate in the White House.President Trump has staffed his administration with hawks who believe that the road to solving the Middle East’s problems runs through Tehran. Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, has accused Iran of trying to “hold the world hostage to its bad behavior.” Defense Secretary James Mattis once described the three biggest threats to American national security as “Iran, Iran, Iran.”A former State Department official who worked under Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, told me that the Trump administration is “obsessed” with Iran in the same way that the Reagan administration was obsessed with the Soviet Union. Inside the government, the former official added, “Iran, ISIS, Al Qaeda, are all mentioned in the same breath, as a menacing threat.”But Americans aren’t exactly itching for a new war. (A majority, in fact, believes the country would be better off staying in the nuclear deal with Iran.) So how can the Trump administration build a case for a pre-emptive strike?Those claims of a nefarious alliance with Al Qaeda might help. The “bomb Iran” crowd has long pointed to the presence of senior Qaeda officials, including members of the Bin Laden family, inside Iran since late 2001.But Iran is far from being a base or command center for Al Qaeda. In 2001, after hundreds of Qaeda fighters crossed into Iran from Afghanistan fleeing American airstrikes, the Iranians deported most of them back to their countries of origin. In 2003, the Iranians offered to swap Qaeda members held under house arrest for members of Mujahedeen Khalq, a militant group that seeks to overthrow the Iranian government, who are being detained by American forces in Iraq.The relationship between the Salafi Sunnis of Al Qaeda and the Shiite clerics of Iran is “not one of alliance” but “highly antagonistic” and “largely based on indirect and unpleasant negotiations over the release of detained jihadis and their families, including members of Bin Ladin’s family,” according to a 2012 report by the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States Military Academy at West Point. The report said that Iran held onto senior Qaeda figures not to protect or assist them but to use them as bargaining chips with the United States and also as a deterrent against Qaeda attacks.When I asked terrorism experts what they made of the alleged Iran-Al Qaeda ties, they were unanimous in their incredulity.“I’ve never seen any evidence of active collaboration,” said Jason Burke, the author of an acclaimed book on Al Qaeda.Ali Soufan, a former F.B.I. agent and the author of the new book “Anatomy of Terror,” dismissed the coverage of the C.I.A.’s documents as an “oversimplification of the facts” and a result of “the Trump administration joining Saudi Arabia’s anti-Iran campaign.”Few would deny that Iran has sponsored groups listed by the United States as “foreign terrorist organizations,” such as Hamas and Hezbollah. But, say the experts, support for Al Qaeda is another matter altogether. As William McCants, a former American government adviser on extremism and author of a recent book on the Islamic State, put it, Iran and Al Qaeda “never embraced as lovers.”So far, none of the documents newly released by the C.I.A. contains a smoking gun. Have Iranian security forces and members of Al Qaeda had contacts, or done deals? Probably. Are there Qaeda figures still living in Iran? Almost definitely. Does that mean there’s an anti-American alliance between Iran and Al Qaeda? No.Mr. Trump, like Mr. Bush before him, is beating the drum for war in the Middle East. But he needs a pretext for an attack on a sovereign nation that, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, is complying with the terms of the nuclear deal. The American public fell for a false pretext in 2003 — and it cannot afford to do so again. Saddam Hussein was not allied with Al Qaeda; for all its faults, neither is the Iranian government.As Mr. Bush himself once famously tried, yet failed, to say: “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.”', 'Judge Ruchie, the Hasidic Superwoman of Night Court - The New York TimesJust before the Jewish High Holy Days this fall, Judge Rachel Freier was rushing around her kitchen, as she perpetually is. She had just cooked a salmon dish for Sabbath dinner. She was talking to her daughter in Israel on her headset. She was at a countertop, cutting apples and wrapping tuna salad sandwiches to take to work, because at night court in Brooklyn, where she presides, there’s little to eat that’s kosher.Stepping outside her townhouse in Borough Park, Brooklyn, she climbed into her purple and white minivan emblazoned with the emblems of the female volunteer emergency medical service she founded in her ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. A trained paramedic, she keeps her medical bags in her vehicle, just in case.“My car is like my second home,” she said.This is Ruchie Freier, as friends call her, a 52-year-old Hasidic Jewish grandmother who has blazed a trail in her insular religious community with so much determination that the male authorities have simply had to make room. Eleven years ago, she became one of the first Hasidic female lawyers in Brooklyn, and last November, she was elected as a judge to civil court, making her almost certainly the first female Hasidic elected official in the country. She has done so not by breaking the strict religious rules that govern ultra-Orthodox women’s lives, but by obeying them so scrupulously that there are limited grounds for objection.“I conformed,” she said in an interview in her spacious living room. “I just found some creative ways to extend what it means to conform.”Along with her official duties, she serves these days as a kind of diplomat between Hasidic Jews and the secular world, explaining the realities of the courts to the Hasidim and the habits of the Hasidim to the courts. And she has also been using her public platform to warn publicly of what she sees as a grave threat to her community’s survival, an epidemic of lost youth and suicides that is driven, she believes, by an unforgiving culture of judgment among ultra-Orthodox schools and families that she feels needs to change.Last summer, she wrote a column for Vos Iz Neias, an online Orthodox news source, about Malky Klein, a Hasidic girl who had been expelled from her yeshiva and died of a heroin overdose in June. She quoted anecdotal statistics that estimate 70 Orthodox Jewish children have died of drug overdoses or suicide in the past year.“What happened in our community; why have so many of our children been cast away — thrown overboard into dangerous and troubled waters?” she wrote. “We need to unite and champion true Torah values to solve our problem.”Most Hasidic women do not pursue high-profile success in the outside world. They are taught their most sacred role is to maintain the religious sanctity of their home and raise their children. “What a woman does in order to enhance her glory is not put herself out as an example to other people in the public domain, but rather in private, in the home,” said Samuel Heilman, a professor of sociology at City University of New York and an expert on the Orthodox and Hasidic communities.“The men are in the forefront, they run the world, and we are the power behind the throne,” said Pearl Engelman, 70, a great-grandmother in the Satmar Hasidic sect in Williamsburg, who broke that paradigm several years ago by speaking publicly about a cover-up of child sex-abuse cases in the ultra-Orthodox community.Women are generally permitted to work outside the home to support their families, so long as they comport with religious rules. And Judge Freier felt she could do all that was expected of her as a Hasidic woman — and be a judge, a paramedic and a voice for change, too.“Everyone was waiting to see, ‘What is she going to do?” Judge Freier said of the wary attitude toward her after she became a judge. “And I’m the same. I dress the same, I still cook and I still bake and I do whatever I always did. Whatever we consider important traditional Hasidic values, I didn’t let go. So I guess it was an eye-opener for everyone.”“She is a good barometer of how this community is going through a transition,” Mr. Heilman, the sociologist, said. “It might seem glacially slow from the perspective of the outside world, but clearly she is a sign of the growing power of women, of the impact of democracy and an open society.”A few minutes before her 5 p.m. shift on a recent evening, Justice Freier arrived at Brooklyn Criminal Court on Schermerhorn Street. She is only 5 feet tall, and slender. She was dressed formally, with a dark wig covering her hair to meet the modesty requirements of her sect, and a tailored business suit, its skirt reaching below her knees.It was a half-hour drive from her home but a universe away from Borough Park, where men with side curls and women pushing strollers speak Yiddish on the streets. Here there were police officers and court officers in bulletproof vests. In a narrow hallway, Judge Freier conferred briefly with another female judge about a case. She was ushered into an elevator used to transport prisoners, and strode to her chambers through a warren of hallways divided by metal fences.She will pray, as she does three times a day, before she takes the bench. Her rebbetzin, a female religious mentor such as the wife of a rabbi, had given her a special prayer. “That people shouldn’t malign me or put me in positions, or ask for things I shouldn’t do,” she said. “That I should make the right decisions, because we are all human beings, and don’t have any ability to see the future.”There are precedents for what Judge Freier has accomplished, but not many. In Israel, a small group of ultra-Orthodox women have formed  a political party to run for office, despite opposition from rabbis who still disapprove of women entering public life. In 2013, a Hasidic woman in Montreal ran for a local City Council seat and won. And in the Bible, there is a female judge in the Book of Judges: Devora, or Deborah, a prophetess who calls the Israelites to battle. But there has not been a female ultra-Orthodox judge for centuries, certainly not within the Hasidic movement, which was founded in 18th-century Eastern Europe.Judge Freier recalled that her rebbetzin told her, “If God gave us Devora, the judge, if we have that in our history, that means that Ruchie Freier should be a judge. That’s it!”Yet Justice Freier is careful not to call herself a feminist. For her, it is a radical charge that would imply she wants to overstep and reject traditional gender boundaries. That could lead to community members ostracizing her and her family, which could limit her ability, for example, to arrange marriages for her two unmarried daughters.So she stays away from controversial gender issues. She does not want to be a judge in a religious rabbinical court, a strictly male domain that rules over many civil matters for ultra-Orthodox Jews. She does not pray in the men’s section of the gender-segregated synagogues. She does not want to wear a Tallis, a traditional male prayer shawl, as some Reform Jewish women now do.“I wanted to succeed, but I wanted to do it from within my community,” she said. “I love Borough Park, I love the people here. I didn’t want to break away.”Just after 5 p.m., Judge Freier took the bench. She would see a steady stream of turnstile jumpers, low level assault cases, drug users and order-of-protection violators until 1 a.m. A swirl of public defenders, prosecutors and police officers surrounded her.Night court is the emergency room of criminal court, a tough shift that tends to fall to new judges. On an average night in the misdemeanor part, she will arraign up to 50 men, deciding whether they should be released while awaiting trial or remanded on bail. On that evening, some cases took 5 minutes — the district attorney recommended release, and she agreed. On others, she asked questions for 20 minutes or more.Judge Freier never expected to be in criminal court. She won a seat in Civil Court. But in New York, an administrative office decides where to put judges, and she was assigned to criminal court a few weeks before she started in January. She has been nonetheless energized by the task.The New York City judicial system under Mayor Bill de Blasio is moving toward alternatives to bail, such as vocational training and supervised release, for low-level crimes. Judge Freier has embraced the trend. A young defendant came up, accused of misdemeanor assault of his girlfriend. Judge Freier inquired into his record, and found out that his past offenses consisted of stealing MetroCards and using marijuana. She reduced his bail from $2,500 to $250.Another man, obviously mentally ill, stood before her. He had exposed himself and masturbated in a Popeye’s restaurant. She took her time and decided to release him before trial with mandated mental health treatment, even though the district attorney recommended he be held on $5,000 bail.She is inspired by two things, she said later: the possibility of making a positive change for a defendant, and her own volunteer experiences within the ultra-Orthodox community counseling teenagers who had turned to drugs and other vices. She found time and time again that they were not bad children; they were just doing bad things.“I want you to understand the importance of what’s being offered to you in court,” she told a 17-year-old who had been charged with possession of a knife, offering to dismiss the charges if he stays out of trouble for six months. “I want you to choose your friends, stay in school, do your schoolwork, and stay out of trouble, because you’ve got potential, but it’s in your hands.”Judge Freier was raised in a traditional ultra-Orthodox home in Borough Park, graduating from an ultra-Orthodox high school for girls that discouraged college. Shortly afterward, she married a Hasidic man, David Freier, and became a legal secretary to support his Judaic studies.Then Mr. Freier, who is now a mortgage broker, decided to go to college so he could earn money for the family. That was already a groundbreaking decision among the insular ultra-Orthodox, where even for a man to enroll in a secular university was rare. At his graduation, Mrs. Freier remembers saying to herself, “It’s my turn,” she recounted in a speech to an Orthodox Union women’s group in June. Her husband agreed. Over the next 10 years, she graduated from Touro College, and Brooklyn Law School. By then, she was 40, with six children.More opportunities have opened up for Hasidic women in recent years, with some women pursuing flexible or online degrees in fields like accounting or special education, even as some ultra-Orthodox rabbis continue to disapprove of college for women. Law school, however, had little precedent.“At every stage, everyone said, it’s never going to happen,” she told the women’s group.Even Hasidic women have had mixed feelings about her choices.“O.K., she’s a superwoman, Ruchie Freier, she’s great, she dresses modestly, her deportment is modest,” said Mrs. Engelman, the Satmar great-grandmother from Williamsburg, explaining the more conservative view of her generation.“She’s one in a million. But there isn’t this tremendous yearning to want to be like her. We think, ‘I have my career at home, I want to excel in what I am doing.’”Yet when Judge Freier passed the bar in 2006, her first clients were Hasidic men from the ultra-strict Satmar sect, who needed help with real estate transactions and liked that she spoke Yiddish, she recalled. (Judge Freier, by marriage, is part of the Bobov Hasidic sect.)Her real estate practice grew. Still, the idea that she could parlay her experience to win a local judicial election was unthinkable. So many factors fell into place to make it happen that her oldest son, Moshe, 30, said he didn’t expect to see such a thing again in his lifetime.For one, it was actually her uncle and mentor, Judge David I. Schmidt, who held the seat she would win in her judicial district, which includes Borough Park. He retired in 2015, after his legal secretary sued him, claiming she was fired in 2014 for complaining about his inappropriate sexual comments in the office.Then her opponents in the Democratic primary both had legal trouble. The Daily News reported before the September vote that Morton M. Avigdor, who had the support of local Democratic elected officials, had misused more than $500,000 from an estate of which he was an executor. Her other opponent, Jill Epstein, a secular Jew, had been censured by a panel of judges for failing to respond to inquiries on an ethical matter.Voters “must go with Freier,” The Daily News urged in an editorial.She ran a spirited but careful campaign. Her Yiddish theme song, broadcast from four S.U.V.’s covered with fliers on Election Day, referred to her as Mrs. Freier, not by her first name. Her fliers didn’t feature her photograph, to avoid charges of immodesty. Her husband, not she, gathered the endorsements of 10 local rabbis, who praised both “Mr. and Mrs. Freier” in a letter for their good works in the community.Mr. Freier, 56, a soft-spoken man with a graying beard who jokes that he is now referred to as the judge’s husband, said that he thinks her record of service made the difference. “They liked what she did with the ambulance service, the at-risk youth,” he said.Of all her causes, it is the EMS service about which Judge Freier seems most passionate, perhaps because of the ongoing struggle to keep it alive. Ultra-Orthodox women in Brooklyn had tried to form an all-female emergency service since the 1980s, mostly to help women in emergency birthing situations, she said. But it never happened.Judge Freier pushed for it. In the years that she worked as an attorney in private practice, she signed up for an emergency medical technician course with her mother, who had always told her she could do anything, “unless it’s illegal, immoral or against the Torah,” she said.When the powerful male-run Jewish ambulance service, Hatzolah, declined to open to female volunteers at her request in 2011, Judge Freier applied for a license for a separate female EMS service, Ezras Nashim. It opened with some 20 volunteers in 2014. When local rabbis were reluctant to support it publicly, her husband went to Israel and filmed himself getting rabbinical approval from senior sages.Ezras Nashim, she said, is not about being a feminist, but about reclaiming the traditional role of women to help in their own God-given way. It is the same sentiment that drives her other work. “We aren’t saying the men aren’t good,” Judge Freier said. “But there is something different about us just by the fact that we’re women. We are bringing something that you can’t give.”The service, which she still leads as director, was recently named EMS agency of the year by the city and state emergency medical service councils. Right now, its women respond in their own cars to emergencies, and they help the 911 ambulance dispatched to the scene. But it is now applying for its own ambulance license and in the coming months will face a public hearing at which Hatzolah and other services can object.Judge Freier is girding herself for the hearing, even looking forward to it. She has been practicing what she will say.“I want someone to look me in the face and say that religious women can’t do it,” she said, as she drove to court in her minivan. “I want to see who is going to have the nerve to face me and say, ‘Jewish women aren’t capable.’ I feel bad; I am going to make mincemeat out of that guy.”', 'What’s the Economic Cost of Brexit? Pineapples Tell a Tale - The New York TimesSITTINGBOURNE, England — Britain is increasingly grappling with the bewildering economic consequences of its pending departure from the European Union. For one company, Nim’s Fruit Crisps, the impact is measured in the soaring cost of pineapple.Nim’s dries fruits into snacks served up like potato chips, operating out of a former metal shop in this industrial enclave east of London. One of its best-selling varieties uses pineapple from Costa Rica that is shipped in by an Amsterdam-based trading company.The pineapple is priced in euros. Since Britain’s decision to leave the European Union — widely known as Brexit — the British pound has surrendered nearly 14 percent of its value against the euro on fears that trade will be disrupted.Confronting higher prices for pineapple, the company’s founder, Nimisha Raja, recently brought in a machine to replace three workers who used to peel fruit by hand. “I had to cut costs somewhere,” she said.She could be speaking for all of Britain.In the 16 months since the referendum that set Brexit in motion, the British economy has weakened in the face of a confounding array of uncertainties. Thrift is the order of the day, along with worries about multinational companies’ paring their investments in Britain.Last week, the picture appeared to brighten, as official data showed the economy had expanded a tad more than expected between July and September. The growth of 0.4 percent for the quarter, which bested expectations of 0.3 percent, reinforced the market’s assumptions that the Bank of England will lift rates when it convenes on Thursday, using a presumably stronger economy as the impetus.But some economists fear such a move is premature given Britain’s fragile state. Many focused on plunging retail and car sales as a harbinger of trouble.The drop in the pound has lifted prices on goods ranging from Italian olive oil to Chinese-made electronics. The rate of inflation reached 3 percent in September, the fastest pace in five years. Consumer spending has dipped over the past year while consumer credit is rising — a combination that often ends badly.The Brexit referendum prompted negotiations through which Britain and a jilted Europe are supposed to hash out their future dealings. But the talks have proved acrimonious and largely futile. This has heightened concerns that a two-year deadline on negotiations could pass without a deal, subjecting companies that trade across the English Channel with unsettling ambiguities about future rules. The Bank of England has been warning banks to prepare for that very eventuality as one possible outcome.With the boundaries of commerce unclear, some companies are reassessing the appeal of centering operations in Britain, the former seat of a global empire that increasingly looks like an island nation.“Clearly, growth has slowed quite sharply over the last several months,” said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. “There is a sense that companies have been postponing investment.”Britain now stands as one of the world’s weakest major economies, even as Europe, Asia and North America enjoy relatively robust growth. Over the first nine months of the year, the British economy expanded at an annualized rate of only 1.3 percent.Absent a deal, global banks are confronting the prospect that they could no longer use their London office to serve customers across the Continent. Many have been scouting spaces in financial centers that are firmly within European Union territory.Citigroup has outlined plans to set up a trading operation in Frankfurt, while applying for a backup license in France. Goldman Sachs recently leased expanded office space in Frankfurt.In the West Midlands, an industrial reach of England that includes Birmingham, foreign direct investment dipped slightly in the year after the Brexit vote, according a recent assessment from the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce.The chamber pinned the blame on “uncertainty caused by the outcome of the E.U. referendum,” which was “delaying investment decisions, a trend echoed in other areas of the U.K.”Chamber representatives have been turning their attention beyond the European Union in pursuit of fresh investment. A delegation recently returned from Turkey. In planning future visits, the chamber is especially focused on cultivating business with members of the British Commonwealth.“It’s a rewinding of history, overtly looking for trade with Commonwealth countries, rather than with Europe,” said John Lamb, a chamber spokesman. “We really are starting to look at markets in the post-Brexit world.”At the KimberMills International factory in the Black Country west of Birmingham, workers use tongs to pluck glowing orange blocks of steel from a caldron-like furnace, then pound the metal into desired shapes using a three-and-a-half-ton hammer hoisted by a pulley.Other workers guide lathes and drills to yield an assortment of industrial parts — rockers for marine engines, clamps for oil pipelines, components for gearboxes of construction machinery.The plunge in the pound has raised the price of steel the company imports from Sweden, the Czech Republic and Italy. The company has raised its prices to adjust.KimberMills taps a forge in Eastern Europe to produce large parts that are beyond its works in England. If Britain fails to strike a trade deal with Europe, these parts could face tariffs. The company has already begun seeking out alternative suppliers in Britain.“Despite everything that happens, there’s a resilience to the British market,” said Larry Joyce, the company chairman. “We just get on with it.”But on a recent afternoon at the Great Western pub, a cozy, beer-scented den in Wolverhampton, people worried that such sentiments were being overwhelmed by the economic realities of Brexit.The pub has been doing a brisk business, owing to the success of the local soccer team, the Wolverhampton Wanderers, whose stadium is within walking distance. But customers were nursing woes.“Brexit is a disaster,” said Richard Lloyd, 48, the proprietor of a local construction company, as he hoisted a pint of Guinness. “It’s thrown a lot of people into uncertainty. Companies are certainly delaying investment. They are being very cautious.”Two years ago, Mr. Lloyd employed as many as 20 people. These days, he has only four. “If things were going really swimmingly, I’d hire more,” he said.A local taxi driver, B. Maan, recalled how he used to take home 200 pounds, or about $266, in the course of a Saturday night, ferrying revelers to pubs. These days, he is fortunate to secure 120 pounds.“People are spending less,” he said.Time itself has become a threat. As negotiations yield headlines about sniping within Britain’s governing Conservative party, each week that passes absent clarity amplifies pressure on companies to shift people and operations to Europe.“We can’t see how investment particularly, but also consumption, will not be affected,” said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. “How can you go ahead with big investments when you don’t know what framework will result?”For Nim’s Fruit Crisps, the variables of Brexit have advanced British self-sufficiency.Previously reliant on a supplier in Belgium for most of its fruits and vegetables, the company has in recent months found domestic suppliers for every needed variety except pineapple, limiting its exposure to the vagaries of exchange rates. Today, Nim’s buys apples, parsnips, cucumbers and a range of other crops from British farmers.The fall in the pound has also made Nim’s products cheaper outside Britain, bolstering its exports, which now make up more than half of total sales. Nim’s snacks are sold in Germany, France, Italy, India, Israel and — soon — Saudi Arabia.“What I’ve learned is that Europe isn’t the only market for us,” said Ms. Raja, whose Nim’s business card identifies her as TheBoss.Yet as she seeks to complete a deal putting her crisps on the shelves of a major British supermarket chain, Ms. Raja worries that the needed volumes will exceed the capacities of Britain.“I suddenly have to find 100 tons of apples,” she said.She is scoping out farms in Poland, even as she worries about the value of British money in a world shaped by Brexit.“I have to keep my margins tight,” she said.', 'ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates – Stepping into the Louvre Abu Dhabi, one of the first artworks a visitor sees is a two-headed Neolithic statue from Jordan, one of the oldest known in human history.That duality — looking back and toward the future, encompassing both East and West — is a theme that extends throughout the new museum, which is opening to the public on Saturday after a decade of delays and questions over laborers\' rights.The conservative mores of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates that\'s more buttoned-up than freewheeling Dubai, can be seen in the relative absence of pieces depicting nudity. Still, artwork at the new Louvre offers a brief history of the world and its major religions, not shying away from Judaism in a country that officially does not recognize Israel."Here at the Louvre Abu Dhabi, we\'ve accomplished history," Mohamed Khalifa al-Mubarak, the chairman of Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority, said at a ceremony for journalists on Monday. "This museum is a lot more than just a museum."The modernist museum, designed by French architect Jean Nouvel, sits under a honeycombed dome of eight layers of Arab-style geometric shapes.It draws the lapping waters of the Persian Gulf into its outer corridors, allowing individual beams of light that pass through the roof to strike the surface and cast dancing reflections across the white walls. At night, light inside pours out like tiny little stars from a salt shaker against the city\'s skyline."I imagine this metaphor of the sky, cosmic, cosmographic, with a random system like the stars itself," Nouvel told The Associated Press. "I imagine that with not a lot of lighting, just a little bit to create a kind of rain of light."That rain has been a long time coming in this desert country, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. Authorities first announced the Louvre Abu Dhabi project in 2007 as Dubai feverishly built the world tallest building and other wonders.Today, much of Saadiyat Island, envisioned as a cultural district anchored by the museum, is still empty. A planned Middle East outpost of HYPERLINK "https://apnews.com/30f394387a6c46f495b581b66441edea" , with just a poured foundation on the salt flood plain.Part of the reason is the drop in global energy prices from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to around $30 in early 2016. Officials in Abu Dhabi have not disclosed how much it cost to build the museum.What is known is that Abu Dhabi agreed to pay France $525 million for the use of the "Louvre" name for the next 30 years and six months, plus another $750 million to hire French managers to oversee the 300 loaned works of art. A center at Paris\' Louvre now bears the name of the late UAE President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, which was also part of the deal.During construction, the project faced intense criticism over conditions faced by laborers, who faced low pay, long hours and hot conditions. A worker was killed in an accident in 2015 while another died of "natural causes" in 2016, according to Abu Dhabi authorities.Hundreds working on projects on the island, including the Louvre, also were deported or lost their work visas for launching strikes over their conditions, according to HYPERLINK "https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/02/10/uae-abuses-nyu-louvre-guggenheim-project" . Labor strikes are illegal in the UAE.Jean-Luc Martinez, the president-director of the Louvre in Paris, contends the museum spoke "very frankly" about laborer conditions. He described the museum as a bridge between Asia, Africa and Europe."We are not a European museum," he told the AP. "It\'s a place to see the world from Abu Dhabi."That begins in the first gallery, where the floor bears an outline of the UAE with the names of different world cities in Arabic, China, English and Hindi. Different cultures face each other in exhibits: for example, a French suit of armor is positioned to look directly across from a Japanese warrior\'s outfit.The museum also makes a point to put the world\'s religions side by side.In one exhibit, a Jewish funerary stele from France in 1250 sits next to a Tunisian Muslim\'s funerary steel and a Christian archbishop\'s stone epitaph from Tyre, Lebanon. A painted French stone statue of Virgin and Child stands by a section of a Syrian Quran dating to around 1250, open to a page recounting the night during the holy month of Ramadan when Muslims believe the holy book was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.In a darkened room, a page from the Blue Quran, one of the oldest ever found, sits near a Gothic Bible, Buddhist sutras and a Torah from Yemen dating to 1498.In a Middle East still torn by religious and sectarian conflict, whether between Sunni and Shiite or Israelis and the Palestinians, simply putting them side by side is a major statement."By addressing their message to all humanity without distinction, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam transcended local cultural characteristics and deeply transformed ancient societies," one placard reads. "These religions shared with Judaism the concept of monotheism but diverged on the subjects such as the representation of the divine."Nudity, however, is only lightly represented, either in bare breasts on an Italian dish or nude bronze ballerina statuettes by Edgar Degas, seemingly dancing in the line of sight of James McNeill Whistler\'s famed painting of his mother. Whistler\'s painting joins a woman\'s portrait on wood by Leonardo da Vinci, two works by Pablo Picasso and a hot-pink Andy Warhol image of an electric chair.For now at least, the museum\'s exhibit ends with an installation by Chinese artist Ai Weiei called "A Foundation of Light," an illuminated work of steel and glass that recalls the museum\'s gleam at night.___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/jongambrellap" .

He was 96.The cause was heart disease, his son, Daniel, said.Conducting his research and practice in Philadelphia and New York City, Dr. Minuchin (pronounced meh-NOO-chin) helped redefine the role of a therapist.Moving away from traditional methods, which focused on plumbing the individual psyche, he took a broader perspective, considering the role of the family and other social environments in shaping a patient’s behavior.And rather than adhering to the therapist’s traditional role as passive listener, he became an inquisitive interventionist who challenged his patients’ preconceptions.“He teases, cajoles, flatters, confronts, scorns, praises, argues, apologizes — turning himself into a rabbi, a magician, a kindly uncle or a bullying authority, to help a family get out of some rigid pattern that causes its members pain,” Sophie Freud, a professor of social work and a granddaughter of Sigmund Freud, wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1993 in critiquing Dr. Minuchin’s book “Family Healing: Tales of Hope and Renewal From Family Therapy,” written with Michael P. Nichols.“We are dazzled by Dr. Minuchin’s instant understanding of the deeper dynamics of every case and by his imaginative interventions,” Professor Freud wrote.Paul L. Wachtel, of the City College of New York, called Dr. Minuchin “one of the founders of family therapy.” Discussing that branch of psychiatry in his review, also in The Times Book Review, of “Institutionalizing Madness: Families, Therapy and Society” (1989, with Joel Elizur), Professor Wachtel invoked the “no man is an island” metaphor.“Family therapists,” he wrote, “are disciples not so much of Freud as of John Donne.”Dr. Minuchin explored what he called psychosomatic families, finding that their common characteristics included avoidance of conflict and an ostensible civility that masked submerged anger.A child may become anorexic as a result of rifts between her parents, he said in 1974. “So the child doesn’t fight; she doesn’t say, ‘No, I won’t,’ ” he explained. “She just doesn’t eat.”He added: “We work with the family to get their conflicts out into the open, so that everybody can see that their problem isn’t that they have a little girl who won’t eat, but that the family is enmeshed — they are all into each other’s lives so much that the system simply can’t work. The children have no rights as children; the parents have no rights as parents.”Dr. Minuchin said it made no sense to blame parents for their children’s psychosomatic disorders.“There’s no perfect family; it’s a myth,” he said. “One set of circumstances might lead to an anorexic child, another to a depressive. Perfect parenting is an impossible thing, like being a perfect president or something like that. It’s trying to do good through a series of mistakes. It’s part of the human condition.“No one,” he added, “knows how to do it right.”Dr. Minuchin, a son of Jewish immigrants from Russia, was born on Oct. 13, 1921, in San Salvador, Argentina, north of Buenos Aires. His father, Mauricio, owned a small store and, after it failed during the Depression, herded horses. His mother was the former Clara Tolachier.Salvador Minuchin was inspired to help young delinquents after a high school teacher, quoting the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, described them as victims of society. He later became active in leftist protests opposing the military government’s seizure of Argentine universities and was jailed for several months.After earning a medical degree from the National University of Córdoba in Argentina, he enlisted in the Israeli Army during the 1948 war for independence.Dr. Minuchin studied child psychiatry in the United States with Dr. Nathan Ackerman, who later established what is now the Ackerman Institute for the Family in Manhattan. He returned to Israel to treat Holocaust orphans and children displaced by wars, then came back to New York to train in psychoanalysis at the William Alanson White Institute.He went on to work as a child psychiatrist at the Wiltwyck School for delinquent boys in the Hudson Valley, where he developed his theory of what became known as structural family therapy. He recounted his experiences with several co-authors in “Families of the Slums” (1967).In the mid-1960s, Dr. Minuchin was the director of psychiatry at Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia, director of the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School.He retired as the clinic’s director in 1975 and served as director emeritus and head of training until 1983. He then returned to New York to establish the Family Studies Institute (now the Minuchin Center for the Family), a nonprofit training center for therapists. He also joined the faculty of the New York University School of Medicine as a research professor.Dr. Minuchin retired in 1996, moving first to Boston and then to Florida, but continued to teach and write.His wife, who died in 2015, was the former Patricia Pittluck, a psychologist and author. In addition to their son, he is survived by a daughter, Jean Minuchin; a granddaughter; and a sister, Sara Itzigsohn.', 'In China, Aung San Suu Kyi Finds a Warm Welcome (and No Talk of Rohingya) - The New York TimesBEIJING — For the second time in a week, one of Myanmar’s top leaders is visiting Beijing, as international criticism over the brutal purge of Rohingya Muslims is bringing the neighboring countries together.Casting aside past misgivings about China’s one-party system, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto civilian leader of Myanmar and a Nobel Peace laureate, arrived on Thursday to attend a conference for international political parties hosted by China’s Communist Party.After a month of uncomfortable meetings with Western officials including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Pope Francis, and having her Freedom of Oxford award stripped for her failure to criticize the military, she is sure to find a warmer welcome in Beijing.Preceding her, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the architect of Myanmar’s scorched-earth military campaign to eject the Rohingya, met China’s president Xi Jinping last week. In a show of mutual admiration, Mr. Xi described Chinese-Myanmar military relations as the “best” ever.As Washington begins to pursue sanctions against Myanmar’s Army for what American and United Nations officials call a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya Muslim minority, China is taking advantage and filling the gap.Already spending billions of dollars on infrastructure projects in Myanmar, China is now also assisting its neighbor in diplomatic efforts to try and help burnish the country’s image in the face of widespread criticism.Though China has usually been reluctant to become involved in mediation, it has offered to broker talks between Myanmar and Bangladesh, now the host of more than 600,000 Rohingya who fled the military campaign of systematic rape, massacre and arson in Myanmar.As China moves more aggressively to build a sphere of influence in Southeast Asia, Myanmar is a prime asset, a border state with a long coastline that offers a strategic outlet to the Indian Ocean.The predominantly Buddhist country has been an elusive catch for China. Anti-Chinese sentiment pervades Myanmar’s population, and there has been suspicion that China’s infrastructure projects are intended to help China more than Myanmar.With the military in the ascendancy again and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi sidelined and frustrated with the United States’ denunciation of the Rohingya crackdown, an increasingly isolated Myanmar is accepting China’s courtship.“Myanmar values China’s understanding of the Rakhine issue, which is complicated and delicate,” Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said during a recent visit by the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, to Myanmar.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi refuses to use the word Rohingya and instead refers to Rakhine, the state where most of the Rohingya live among a Buddhist majority. She has declined to condemn the actions of the Myanmar military.At the United Nations, China blocked efforts to organize a resolution against Myanmar, and stopped language to ensure that the Rohingya have the right of return to the country.The crisis over the Rohingya gives China an opportunity to build a reputation as a peace builder, Chinese analysts say. China is already involved in brokering peace talks between warring ethnic groups in Myanmar’s northern region, which is adjacent to the Chinese border.“China’s broad objective is to let the world see it as the new power broker that can get things, like peace building and political settlements, done,” said Baohui Zhang, professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.As he starts his second term as president, Mr. Xi is intent on projecting China’s “great power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics,” and an effort to help facilitate the return of the Rohingya would earn China some credit, Mr. Baohui said.A three point mediation plan offered by Mr. Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, does not specifically mention the plight of the Rohingya, hundreds of thousands of whom are now living in squalid refugee camps in Bangladesh just over the border from Myanmar.Myanmar and Bangladesh have held talks about what to do about the refugees, but no Rohingya have been present. It is not clear whether Chinese envoys were present.“The plan doesn’t commit China to very much in the way of mediation,” said Mary P. Callahan, associate professor of international studies at the University of Washington.Mr. Wang’s proposal called for a cease-fire without a definition of who should stop what activities.The foreign minister asked for a strengthening of relations between Myanmar and Bangladesh, and said China would pursue economic development in Rakhine, the poorest area of Myanmar and the center of the military’s purge of the Rohingya.China is calling for an economic corridor linking India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and China that would run through Rakhine.One of China’s major construction companies is scheduled to start building a $7.3 billion deep-sea port next year at Kyaukpyu, a port town in Rakhine on the Indian Ocean. Pipelines from the port carry gas and oil through Rakhine to southern China.The visit of General Min Aung Hlaing to Beijing in November invigorated a relationship between the Myanmar military and Beijing that had been languishing, said U Maung Aung Myoe, professor of international affairs at the International University of Japan and an expert on the Myanmar military.As the possibility of any military ties with the United States disappears, the general can now look more easily to the People’s Liberation Army of China for support, Mr. Maung Aung Myoe said.The United States maintained sanctions against the military junta that ruled Myanmar for decades. But the Obama administration relaxed many of those penalties the year after Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi won the 2015 elections. There were even plans to invite some Myanmar military officers to the United States for training as a way to counter China’s longstanding ties with the army.Since the expulsion of the Rohingya, Washington has stopped contacts with the military, and Congress is considering new sanctions.China had been a major provider of military equipment to Myanmar, but those ties frayed after Beijing sold inferior fighter jets to the air force in the late 1990s, Mr. Maung Aung Myoe said. Since 2001, Myanmar has been buying more from Russia and Israel, he said. Now, China might return as a provider of military equipment.Both armies, he said, were sympathetic to each other’s problems with Muslim minorities. The Chinese military faced what it considered a Muslim insurgency in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, and now the Myanmar Army has expelled the Rohingya.“China wants to help Myanmar by lessening the international pressure on it,” he said.For that, he said, Myanmar’s military was no doubt appreciative.', "The president demanded the rogue regime give up its nuclear program and ripped Tehran for seeking to destabilize an entire region; John Roberts has the roundup for 'Special Report'There’s a pitched rhetorical battle underway right now in Washington as an October 15 deadline approaches for President Trump to certify to Congress that the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran (the JCPOA) is in the national interests of the United States and that Iran is in compliance. Although the president said last week he has made his decision, backers and opponents of the agreement are working overtime to convince him to adopt their recommendations.President Trump has been highly critical of the JCPOA, calling it “the worst deal ever” during the presidential campaign and “an embarrassment to the United States” during his speech to the UN General Assembly on Sept. 19.However, the president reluctantly certified the nuclear deal to Congress twice this year due to heavy pressure from his top national security advisers, especially Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. After a heated discussion with his advisers, Mr Trump made the last certification in July but indicated he did not plan to do so again.A few months ago, Tillerson, McMaster and other advisers were telling President Trump he had no choice but to certify the JCPOA because Iran was in compliance and any violations were “not material.” Many disagreed, including Senators Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Ted Cruz, R-Texas, David Perdue, R-Ga., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who spelled out major instances of Iranian noncompliance and cheating in a July 11, 2017 letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.As the 45 experts said in their letter to President Trump, “It is time to move beyond President Obama’s appeasement of Iran and to begin work on a comprehensive new approach that fully addresses the menace that the Iranian regime increasingly poses to American and international security.” But the main argument Trump advisers made to certify the Iran deal was that if America withdrew it would alienate European leaders.Now, with the president reportedly determined to “decertify,” Tillerson, McMaster and others who oppose a U.S. withdrawal have shifted gears. They have intensified their criticism of the Iran deal as deeply flawed and are proposing the president not certify but remain a party to the deal to fix it later. In addition, they are calling for the JCPOA be sent to Congress for it to impose more sanctions.This supposed middle-ground option would allow President Trump to give a tough-sounding speech lashing out at the JCPOA and demanding major changes. But Iran has made it clear that it will never agree to alter the agreement and Congressional Democrats are certain to filibuster any sanctions legislation that would kill the deal. As a result, the “decertify but remain in the deal” option is actually a clever ploy to ensure the U.S. never withdraws from the nuclear deal.Ambassador John Bolton has a far better and more honest option: a clean withdrawal implementing a comprehensive strategy with America’s allies – including Israel – that addresses the full range of threats posed by Iran.Bolton was tasked to write a plan to do this by former Trump Chief Strategist Steve Bannon in response to the president’s request last July for a policy option to withdraw from the Iran deal. Worried that the Bolton plan could sway Mr. Trump, senior Trump officials have blocked Bolton from meeting with the president. Bolton therefore published his “Iran Deal Exit Strategy” in National Review on August 28.Bolton’s plan has not received a lot of media coverage because senior Trump officials – especially McMaster – have been aggressively working with the press to promote the “decertify but remain in the deal” option. However, the Bolton plan received a huge boost last week when 45 national security experts sent a letter to President Trump urging him to withdraw from the JCPOA using Bolton’s strategy.The letter’s signatories included many leading experts in arms control and nuclear nonproliferation such as former Director of Sandia National Laboratory Paul Robinson, former Under Secretary of State for Arms Control Robert Joseph; former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith; former Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Gen. William Boykin and dozens of other former State and Defense Department officials.The proposal being advanced by McMaster, Tillerson and others -- that President Trump keep the United States in the JCPOA but not certify to Congress that it is in our national security interests -- is absurd, especially after the president called the agreement an embarrassment to the United States. This option will ensure that this dangerous agreement continues as is and will undermine Mr. Trump’s credibility with the American people and the world.As the 45 experts said in their letter to President Trump, “It is time to move beyond President Obama’s appeasement of Iran and to begin work on a comprehensive new approach that fully addresses the menace that the Iranian regime increasingly poses to American and international security.” President Trump should do this by implementing a clean withdrawal from the fraudulent Iran nuclear deal using the plan drafted by Ambassador Bolton.Fred Fleitz is senior vice president for policy and programs with the Center for Security Policy, a national security think tank.

But he stops well short of torpedoing the pact, which was negotiated over 18 months by the Obama administration, European allies and others.Instead, Trump will kick the issue over to Congress, asking lawmakers to come up with new legislation that would automatically re-impose sanctions should Iran cross any one of numerous nuclear and non-nuclear "trigger points," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said in remarks released ahead of Trump\'s announcement.Those "trigger points" would include violations of the deal involving illicit atomic work or ballistic missile testing, support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon\'s Hezbollah movement and other groups that destabilize the region, human rights abuses and cyber warfare, they said.Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to snap the sanctions back into place, modify the law or do nothing. Any decision to re-impose sanctions would automatically kill America\'s participation in the deal.In a White House speech on Friday afternoon, Trump will notify Congress that he is "decertifying" the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, arguing that while Iran is complying with the letter of the agreement, the accord itself is not sufficient to be in U.S. interests."We don\'t dispute that they\'re under technical compliance," Tillerson said. "We\'ve said the agreement has a number of weaknesses in it, and, in fact, one of the weaknesses is the standard to remain in technical compliance is not that difficult, or has not been that difficult for them to meet."In remarks ahead of his address to a group of conservative voters, Trump previewed his position by calling Iran "a terrorist nation like few others" and urged his audience to listen in.Both defenders of the Iran nuclear deal and critics are likely to be displeased by Trump\'s decision. Those who support the deal believe Trump\'s move will badly damage U.S. credibility in future international negotiations, while opponents think he does not go far enough in unraveling the accord.Trump will urge lawmakers to codify tough new requirements for Tehran to continue to benefit from the sanctions relief that it won in exchange for curbing its atomic program, according to Tillerson. And he\'ll announce his long-anticipated intent to impose sanctions on Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard Corps by designating it a terrorist organization under an existing executive order."The reckless behavior of the Iranian regime, and the IRGC in particular, poses one of the most dangerous threats to the interests of the United States and to regional stability," the White House said in a statement. The statement denounced the Obama administration for its "myopic focus on Iran\'s nuclear program to the exclusion of the regime\'s many other malign activities" and said the same "mistakes" would not be repeated.Ali Larijani, Iran\'s parliament speaker, said Friday that any U.S. move against a nuclear deal with Iran would be an "insult" to the United Nations because the U.N. had given the deal its blessing.He added that any revision of the deal would allow Iran to take its own actions, and warned that the U.S. move could destabilize the international situation."We will continue to adhere to our obligations ... for as long as other parties observe the agreement," he said on a visit to Russia.In his speech, Trump also will ask Congress to amend or replace legislation that currently requires him to certify Iranian compliance every 90 days. Officials have said that Trump hates the requirement more than the nuclear deal itself because it forces him to take a position every three months on the deal. That frequency hassend also irritated aides who have complained that they are spending inordinate amounts of time on certification at the expense of other issues.American allies, who have pressed the White House to remain in the nuclear accord, will be closely watching the president\'s address. Trump wants to impress on the European parties to the accord — Germany, France and Britain — the importance of fixing what he sees as flaws in the nuclear accord and addressing malign behavior not covered in the agreement.The Europeans, along with the other parties, Iran, Russia and China, have ruled out reopening the deal. But some, notably France, have signaled a willingness to tackle unresolved issues in supplementary negotiations.Among those issues are the expiration of several restrictions on advanced nuclear activity under so-called "sunset clauses" that will allow Iran to begin ramping up its enrichment capabilities after 10 years, the end of an arms embargo and the eventual easing of demands for a halt to its missile program.In the speech, Trump hopes to "recruit" the Europeans into joining his broad strategy, particularly by punishing the Revolutionary Guard, which he and his national security team believe is fomenting instability, violence and extremism throughout the Middle East and beyond, according to one official.In anticipation of Trump\'s announcements, Republican legislators have drawn up a new version of the law replacing the current 90-day timetable with "semi-annual" certifications, according to drafts seen by the Associated Press this week.Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker said in a statement on Friday that his panel had agreed to fresh certification criteria to include items that are also the province of the U.N. nuclear watchdog and require the U.S. intelligence community to determine if Iran is carrying out illicit activity in facilities to which the International Atomic Energy Agency has not had access.___Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.', 'Why America Needs Foreign Medical Graduates - The New York TimesAs our recent eight-nation bracket tournament showed, many people think the United States health care system has a lot of problems. So it seems reasonable to think of policy changes that make things better, not worse. Making it harder for immigrants to come here to practice medicine would fail that test.The American system relies to a surprising extent on foreign medical graduates, most of whom are citizens of other countries when they arrive. By any objective standard, the United States trains far too few physicians to care for all the patients who need them. We rank toward the bottom of developed nations with respect to medical graduates per population.When physicians graduate from medical school, they spend a number of years as residents. Although they have their degrees, we still require them to train further in the clinical environment to hone their skills. Residents are more than learners, though; they’re doctors. They fill a vital role in caring for patients in many hospitals across the country. We don’t have enough graduates even to fill residency slots. This means that we are reliant on physicians trained outside the country to fill the gap. A 2015 study found that almost a quarter of residents across all fields, and more than a third of residents in subspecialist programs, were foreign medical graduates.Leaving training aside, foreign medical graduates are also responsible for a considerable share of physicians practicing independently today. About a quarter of all doctors in the United States are foreign medical graduates.As in many other fields, foreign medical graduates work in many of the areas that other doctors find less appealing. More than 40 percent of the American primary care work force is made up of people who trained in other countries but moved here. More than half of all the people who focus on caring for older people are foreign medical graduates as well.As if this weren’t enough, foreign medical graduates are more likely to practice in geographic areas of the country where there are physician shortages (typically nonurban areas), and they’re more likely to treat Medicaid patients.As a physician who graduated from a domestic medical school, I’ve often heard others disparaging doctors who went to medical school outside the country as if they were inferior. Those complaints are not supported by data. A study from Health Affairs in 2010 found that patients with congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction had lower mortality rates when treated by doctors who were foreign medical graduates. Another from earlier this year in the BMJ found that older patients who were treated by foreign medical graduates had lower mortality as well, even though they seemed to be sicker in general.A recent study in Annals of Internal Medicine shows that these graduates are also responsible for a significant amount of teaching. Of the 80,000 or so academic physicians in the country, more than 18 percent were foreign medical graduates. More than 15 percent of full professors in medical schools in the United States were educated elsewhere, most often in Asia, Western Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean.Foreign medical graduates also do a lot of research. Although they are ineligible for some National Institutes of Health funding — which is granted only to citizens of this country — they still manage, through collaboration, to be primary investigators on 12.5 percent of grants. They led more than 18 percent of clinical trials in the United States and were responsible for about 18 percent of publications in the medical literature.“Our findings suggest that, by some metrics, these doctors account for almost one fifth of academic scholarship in the United States,” said the lead author of the study, Dhruv Khullar, who is a physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, a researcher at Weill Cornell and a contributor to The Upshot. “The diversity of American medicine — and the conversations, ideas and breakthroughs this diversity sparks — may be one reason for our competitiveness as a global leader in biomedical research and innovation.”The United States is not the only country that relies on doctors trained or educated in other countries. We’re not even the country with the highest percentage of such physicians. According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, almost 58 percent of physicians practicing in Israel are foreign medical graduates. About 40 percent of the doctors in New Zealand and Ireland were trained outside those countries.Because of the sizes of those nations, even though the percentages of foreign medical graduates are higher there, the total numbers aren’t as high as in the United States. In 2015, the O.E.C.D. estimated that the United States had more than 213,000 foreign-trained doctors, and no other country was close. Britain had about 48,000, Germany had about 35,000, and Australia, France and Canada had between 22,000 and 27,000.For years, I’ve listened to doctors tell me stories of physicians who leave Canada — because they were dissatisfied about working in a single-payer health care system. That might have been true decades ago. But in the last 10 years, that number has dropped precipitously. The number of Canadians returning to their country to practice may actually be higher than the number leaving.Although many feared that coverage expansions from the Affordable Care Act might lead to an overwhelmed physician work force, that didn’t happen. That doesn’t mean that America doesn’t have a shortage of physician services, especially when it comes to the care of the oldest, the poorest and the most geographically isolated among us. Even though we know foreign medical graduates care for those patients disproportionately, we make it very difficult for many born and trained elsewhere to practice here. Some Americans need these doctors desperately. Evidence suggests that policies should be made to attract them, not deter them.', 'The Phony Peace Between the Labour Party and Jews - The New York TimesLONDON — From Sept. 23 to 27, the Labour Party held its annual conference in Brighton, England, believing it had the wind at its back. The Tories are in disarray over Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May is mortally sick of self-inflicted wounds, and either way her likely successor — Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg — will be a buffoon.Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was until recently disparaged by doubters in his own party as yesterday’s man, but is now revered by them for the same reason — yesterday being the nearest modern Britain can get to tomorrow. And so the songs rang out in Brighton, the banners flapped, and Labour marched ever backward to the Shelley-inspired slogan “For the many, not the few.”But there is a fly in the ointment: anti-Semitism. How Labour changed roles with the Conservatives as the enemy of the Jews is a tale that cannot be told briefly, but like some of Mr. Corbyn’s closest advisers, it goes all the way back to Stalin.Cognizant of the criticism, though never really believing it, Mr. Corbyn staged his own inquiry a year ago. It was a brief and shoddy shuffling of superficies by Sharmishta Chakrabarti, former director of the human rights group Liberty. Ms. Chakrabarti’s inquiry spoke to very few of the people charging the party with anti-Semitism and understood even fewer of their arguments.She noted the “occasional toxic atmosphere” in the party and recommended cutting out analogies with Hitler and the Nazis when discussing Israel. Not stop thinking Nazi, just stop saying it. And that more or less was that. In response to continuing criticism by Jews, Mr. Corbyn elevated Ms. Chakrabarti to the peerage.At the Labour Conference just concluded there was no sign, as the fringe moved ever closer to the center, that even Ms. Chakrabarti’s modest advice as to Hitler and the Nazis had been heeded. There were calls for some Jewish groups to be excluded from the party. A paper was handed out supporting the claim by Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London, of collusion between German Jews and Nazis. A motion to question the truth of the Holocaust was proposed.By way of a sop to critics, a rule warning against such conduct as might be deemed detrimental to the party — such as hostility to disability, gender reassignment, civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, oh, and anti-Semitism — was adopted. But condemnation of Zionism was as febrile as ever and any Jew — particularly any Israeli Jew — willing to join in could count on a standing ovation. No man is a prophet in his own land but an anti-Zionist Israeli is a hero in this one.If the arguments were old, the prospect of power lent them fresh urgency. In a moment that will live in infamy, the distinguished film director Ken Loach defended questioning the Holocaust. “I think history is for all of us to discuss,” he said, dodging the question of why the Labour Party should have chosen the Holocaust, of all historical events — and not slavery, say — to subject to scrutiny. But we know the answer to that. When the political temperature rises, extremism becomes an allowable indulgence. All things suddenly seem possible; in the euphoria, there is nothing that daren’t be said.George Eliot wrote an essay about the condition of Jews in the late 19th century, titled “The Modern Hep! Hep! Hep!,” a reference to the cry of the Crusaders as they swept through Europe annihilating every Jewish community in their path. Hep stood for “Hierosolyma Est Perdita” — Jerusalem is destroyed. Hep! Hep! Hep!When an avenging army takes to the road there will be no check on the exhilaration of its righteousness and slaughter. Labour Party delegates are hardly crusaders, but the whiff of blood lust rises even from Brighton.To this Mr. Corbyn and those closest to him are tetchily indifferent. Mr. Corbyn goes out of his way not to use the word “anti-Semitism,” and when he is forced into condemnation of it he invokes the platitude that Labour opposes all racism and discrimination. The “all” is important. Burying anti-Semitism among offenses such as bullying and sexual harassment is a dodge to equalize things that are not equal and in the process ensure that anti-Semitism is rarely privileged with a mention of its own.There is method in this evasiveness. To implicitly deny the existence of anti-Semitism — as some continue to deny the Holocaust — is to render it as a sick fantasy of the Jews’ own making, a pathology whose function is to blunt the edge of the anti-Zionist critique. That Jews invoke anti-Semitism primarily to silence critics of Israel is a tired canard, but it continues to be pressed in to service. It serves a purpose: It libels the Jews as liars in the act of protesting innocence of any such offense. And if anti-Semitism is a chimera, then anti-Zionism, so often conflated with it, has nothing after all to apologize for.Desperate to win any sort of concession from Labour, Jews have settled for a phony peace. You desist from overtly anti-Semitic discourse — invoking the malignancy of our appearance and ambitions — and we will allow you your anti-Zionism. But the deal is beginning to unravel as it was always bound to. For the truth is you cannot keep the Jews out of Zionism.A willful historical ignorance sustains anti-Zionism. In some accounts the Israelis drop out of a clear blue sky in 1967 and occupy the West Bank; in others, Zionism is a recent ideology always contested within Jewish society itself. What is elided is the 2,000-year history of Jews returning to the country from which they had been exiled, whether in response to longings for a homeland, to pray where they had once prayed, or to find a place of safety.In 1862, the socialist Moses Hess, collaborator of Karl Marx, published “Rome and Jerusalem,” an argument for the Jews — since all other attempts to live free of persecution had failed — to return to that “inalienable ancestral homeland” toward which they’d been directing their gaze for millenniums. “No modern people which strives for a fatherland of its own,” Hess continued, “can deny the Jew his, without committing moral suicide.”Zionism was thus, in a phrase of Simon Schama’s, a long-gestating movement for “regenerative transformation” — more spiritual than political, and not at all the imperialist adventure that anti-Zionists accuse it of being. A grand ambition, bound to lose its shine when it declined into the banal and sometimes cruel exigencies of statehood, but can we hate a thing in retrospect because we don’t like what it became? And if we do hate it, where is our understanding of the desperation that made it necessary?What needs to be insisted on is that Zionism — the idea not the political events to which it has given rise — is integral to the Jewish mind and imagination. Those who say they are against Zionism but not Jews are speaking in riddles. It is not the Jew who needs to see himself apart from anti-Zionism; it is the anti-Zionist who needs to ask himself what feeds his fervor and whether, in his righteous rage, he is committing what Moses Hess called “moral suicide.” Until then the Labour Party’s slogan will go on reading, “For the many, not the Jew.”', 'U.S. Ambassador to U.N. Escalates Confrontation With Iran - The New York TimesThe Trump administration escalated a bitter confrontation with Iran on Wednesday, demanding that the United Nations Security Council punish the Iranian government for what the American ambassador called its “outlaw behavior” across the Middle East.“The United States will not turn a blind eye to these violations,” the United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, told a Security Council meeting that had been meant to focus on developments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Ms. Haley used her speaking time instead to deliver a critique of Iran. Her remarks were among the most strident denunciations Ms. Haley has made of Iran since she became President Trump’s ambassador in January.The remarks seemed timed partly to respond to international criticism of the administration over Mr. Trump’s avowed hostility to the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and major powers, including the United States, which he has described as an embarrassment and a disaster.She spoke less than a week after Mr. Trump announced that he would disavow the nuclear agreement and might withdraw the United States from the accord altogether unless it was strengthened to his satisfaction.That decision has deeply angered Iran — which has ruled out any renegotiation — and has raised alarms among many American allies, including Britain, France and Germany, which were among the parties to the agreement.They have exhorted Congress to preserve the deal, which they say is doing exactly what had been intended — thwarting Iran’s ability to attain a nuclear weapon. They have warned that the United States is risking isolation, loss of credibility and increased global insecurity if the deal unravels.Accusing the Iranian government of having violated at least four Security Council resolutions with impunity, Ms. Haley said that “nearly every threat to peace and security in the Middle East is connected to Iran’s outlaw behavior.”She argued that the nuclear agreement was an insufficient instrument with which to measure Iran’s relations with the world.“Iran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior,” she said. “And we have allowed them to get away with it. This must stop.”Ms. Haley also demanded that the Council take action on what she called Iran’s “most threatening act”: ballistic missile launchings.A Security Council resolution that put the nuclear agreement into effect calls upon Iran to refrain from ballistic missile tests but does not prohibit them. Iran has argued that its missiles are a defensive countermeasure to deter hostile neighbors, notably Israel and Saudi Arabia, both close American allies.There was no indication that other Council members would act on Ms. Haley’s demands. China and Russia, veto-wielding members who also are parties to the Iran nuclear agreement, are strong supporters of it.More broadly, they oppose the Trump administration’s efforts to ostracize Iran.Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gholamali Khoshroo, offered what amounted to a diametrically opposite appraisal of Iran’s behavior in his Council remarks, saying “no country has done more than Iran” in fighting Middle East terrorism, most notably in fighting the Islamic State.“If we had hegemonic ambitions, the nuclear deal would never have been reached,” Mr. Khoshroo said. He said Mr. Trump’s approach “toward the deal and Iran run counter to all of these efforts and intend to add another crisis to the regional issues.”Hours earlier in Tehran, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, delivered a tough denunciation of Mr. Trump’s position on the nuclear deal and his other criticisms of Iran, calling it “a waste of time to respond to such blatherings and nonsensical remarks by the foulmouthed U.S. president.”In a speech to academics carried by Iranian state media, Ayatollah Khamenei said Iran would not renounce the nuclear agreement as long as the United States does not. “But if it does,” he said, “we will shred it to bits.”Mr. Trump’s decision announced last Friday not to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear agreement triggered a provision in American law that gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions that were rescinded under the accord.Ayatollah Khamenei’s remarks suggested that the reimposition of sanctions would be interpreted by Iran as an American withdrawal from the accord. It is unclear whether Congress will take that action.European leaders, including the European Union’s top foreign policy official, Federica Mogherini, who helped negotiate the nuclear agreement, have urged American lawmakers to preserve it. A growing number of disarmament advocates and diplomats also have publicly defended the agreement.In the latest indication of support, a group of 25 former foreign ministers said Wednesday in a letter to congressional leaders that the agreement was in the best interests of the United States.The signers included former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright of the United States and many of her counterparts from Europe and elsewhere.“A unilateral withdrawal from the agreement would have far-reaching adverse consequences for the security of the United States and America’s standing in the world,” the letter said.“We know from experience that the world counts on the United States to live up to its commitments,” it said. “If the United States loses its credibility, the consequences for its security, and the security of its allies, would be disastrous.”In a telephone interview, Ms. Albright said that the group of former ministers, which meets a few times a year, considered the nuclear agreement “such a good example of multilateral cooperation” that its members felt it was important to speak out.Ms. Albright, whose first diplomatic post was as the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said she understood Ms. Haley’s concerns about Iran’s “counterproductive and dangerous” activities.Still, she said: “Everything would be more serious if they had a nuclear weapon. You’re safer if they don’t have one.”', 'David vs. Goliath Gets an Update: It’s Now Altuve vs. Judge - The New York Times', 'President Trump allows the Obama administration\'s Iran deal to stand, but he chooses not to certify it. Doing so, he kicks the decision making to congress. What are their options?President Trump announced Friday he will decertify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, saying he believes the “radical regime” has committedmultiple violations of theagreement as he kicked a decision over whether to restore sanctions back to Congress.“I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification,” Trump said during a speech at the White House. “We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror, and the very real threat of Iran\'s nuclear breakthrough.”Friday\'s announcement does not withdraw the United States from the Iran deal, which the president called “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.”But the president threatened that he could still ultimately pull out of the deal.“In the event we are notable to reach a solution workingwith Congress and our allies,the agreement will be terminated,” he said. “It is under continuous reviewand our participation can becanceled by me as president atany time.”Speaking to reporters ahead of Trump’s speech, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the president will use the Congressional Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to decertify the agreement, which was negotiated over 18 months by the Obama administration.Congress could then decide to restore sanctions, do nothing or make changes to the law. Trump is pressing Congress to work to fix the deal\'s "flaws."IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL: WHAT IS IT?In making his decision, Trump said, “Iran is not living up to the spirit of the deal.”Among other alleged violations, Trump said Iran failed to meet expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges and intimidated international inspectors into not using their full authority.The president also slammed sunset provisions in the deal itself, complaining that the U.S. got a “weak inspection” in exchange for a “short-term” delay in Iran’s nuclear progress.Trump, meanwhile, announced plans to take action against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, authorizing the Treasury Department to impose targeted sanctions against “its officials, agents, andaffiliates.”“Execution of our strategy beginswith a long overdue step ofimposing tough sanctions onIran\'s Islamic RevolutionaryGuard Corps,” Trump said. “The revolutionary guard is theIranian supreme leader’s corruptpersonal terror force andmilitia.”In his broadside against the Iranian regime, the president said it “remains the world\'s leading state sponsor of terrorism,” accusing it of providing assistance to Al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah and other terrorist networks.The president accused Iran of developing missiles that threaten American troops and allies and imprisoning Americans “on false charges.”“Given the regime\'s murderous past and present, we should not take lightly its sinister vision for the future,” Trump said. “The regimes two favorite chants are ‘Death to America’ and ‘Death to Israel.’”The president did not designate the IRGC a terrorist group, something that had been rumored ahead of the announcement. In the run-up to the decision, Iranian officials threatened consequences if that occurred.“If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world,” IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said Sunday, according to Reuters.The National Resistance Council of Iran, an offshoot organization of the People\'s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK), praised Trump\'s move in support of the de-certification.Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), welcomed the new U.S. policy to "condemn the IRGC\'s gross violations of human rights" in Iran."The regime\'s deadly meddling in the region and concessions made to it in the course of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) have been disastrous, and for which the people of Iran and the region have paid heavily," Rajavi said in a statement provided to Fox News."The IRGC is a prime means of suppression, execution, and torture in Iran, spreading terrorism throughout the world, war mongering and massacre in the region, the drive for acquiring nuclear weapons, and the increase in the proliferation of ballistic missiles," she said. "If the IRGC had been recognized as a terrorist entity earlier and dealt with accordingly, the current situation in the region in general, and Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and Afghanistan in particular, would have been totally different."Trump had been facing a Sunday deadline to notify Congress whether Iran is complying with the accord.Republicans are calling for new legislation that addresses the “flaws” of the agreement.“Lawmakers need to do now what we couldn’t do two years ago: unite around an Iran strategy that truly stops Iran’s nuclear weapons program and empowers the United States and our allies to combat the full spectrum of Iran’s imperial aggression,” Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said in a statement.Democrats accused the president of making matters worse. Former Obama administration official Ben Rhodes, who helped sell the Iran deal, said the president is “provoking” a crisis with his speech.“Hard to overstate how irresponsible it is for Trump to risk blowing up Iran Deal by demanding rest of world justify his campaign rhetoric,” Rhodes tweeted.Fox News’ Serafin Gomez, Mike Emanuel and Perry Chiaramonte and The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'Daydreaming in Germany - The New York Times', 'The Aftermath of War, Seen Through Photographers’ Eyes - The New York TimesWhen Carol McCusker was designing the photography show “Aftermath: The Fallout of War — America and the Middle East,” she wanted “powerful photographs that expanded the notions of individuals when they are considering warfare.”The result, at the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art in Gainesville last year was images of tragedy: a Syrian woman sobbing after a rampage by President Bashar al-Assad’s soldiers; a child in Gaza sitting in the chaos of a destroyed home; a toddler standing in front of the rubble that was once her home in Beirut; portraits of American soldiers who had fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.No art form lends itself to current events as immediately as photojournalism. The greatest photojournalists are on the front lines of history, creating iconic images that shape the interpretation of those events.Ms. McCusker, curator of photography at the museum, which is part of the University of Florida, was careful to set parameters.“We are not antiwar,” she said. “But there is a generation of people who look to war to solve problems. We want to show what war does. I have always been interested in history, and I believe in using photography to address contemporary issues. More and more of our exhibits are of the moment.” As examples, she cited coming exhibits on James Baldwin and Malcolm X.Ms. McCusker is hardly alone. The impetus to use an art form to address the problems in the Middle East prompted Natalie Marsh, director of the Gund Gallery at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, to take the “Aftermath” show, as did Steven High, executive director of the  Ringling Museum in Sarasota, a division of Florida State University.The three museums are connected to schools of higher education, and executives and curators saw the exhibit as an opportunity to involve the students as well as the public. The show arrived this month at the Ringling and will be open through Jan. 21.“Normally we would not take a show that is done by a neighboring institution,” Mr. High said. “We thought it was powerful and we wanted it. It reaches out to the community. There are issues of migration. People are migrating to Tampa. It seemed like something we should say.”Christopher Jones, Ringling’s photography curator, added: “For decades, curators have been thinking about ways to engage their audience. In the past few years politics are so upended, and we are all trying to make sense of the world we live in. Curators are too. Our aim is to garner different perspectives.”The photographers in the exhibit represent a variety of backgrounds, but Ms. McCusker set certain limitations, and she is careful to say that the exhibit has no larger political agenda. The photographs show virtually no guns. “It is about the aftermath,” she said.Among the photographers whose work is included is Lynsey Addario, who frequently contributes to The New York Times. Some of her images capture displaced Syrian refugees: some waiting, desperate to collect their daily bread at a refugee camp in Jordan. From Eman Mohammed, who describes herself as the first female photojournalist in Gaza, are images of families mourning the deaths of men killed in Israeli airstrikes. Rania Matar’s suite of pictures of Lebanon from a 2006 series “What Remains” show the devastation of both cities and homes.Ms. McCusker also used two series on American soldiers. She explained that “The Forever War,” a 2008 book about Iraq and Afghanistan written by Dexter Filkins of the New Yorker, then a New York Times reporter, had strongly influenced her views. In the introduction of the show’s catalog, Mr. Filkins wrote that the strain on American servicemen and servicewomen who fought in those wars was often severe.To capture their personal aftermath, Ms. McCusker incorporated the work of Jennifer Karady, who together with veterans attempted to recreate the emotional impressions of their returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. One portrait shows a former sergeant covering his ears when a truck approaches on an American street. The caption explains that it reminded him of the terrible sound of mortar fire. The exhibition also showcases the photography of Suzanne Opton: images of the heads of soldiers, lying sideways — an unusual pose for men and women who are generally upright in portraits.Two abstract images by the Israeli artist Michal Rovner depict people moving through a landscape, seemingly an effort to show the timelessness of the human condition.But exhibits tied to current events can create conflict, and the selection of photographers provoked some questions in Gainesville, where “some of the Jewish community wanted to see more from Jewish photographers,” Ms. McCusker said. “We got a string of emails saying there should be more photographs from Israeli journalists.”Explaining her selection of photographers to a woman who identified herself as Jewish, Ms. McCusker wrote that “the stream of refugees coming out of those countries is where the appalling crisis of ‘aftermath’ resides.”“It also resides with many of our soldiers,” she added. “This will impact us all for decades to come.”In the letter, she was careful to note that there was a video of a talk between Ms. Mohammed, possibly the most outspoken photographer in the labels she wrote to her photographs, and Mati Milstein, an Israeli photojournalist, in the exhibit’s touch table. Ms. McCusker included a lengthy description of her year living and working in Israel. She added: “I have seen many images of Israeli suffering. We publish them in our press.”That response was sufficient for Joanne Block, a donor to the exhibit, who said,“I felt that Carol had done her utmost to be inclusive and seek out photographers who would appropriately represent the theme: destruction of people’s environment.”In Gambier, Ohio, which Ms. Marsh described as “the land of Trump,” the Gund took the show early this year to connect the Middle East to the community. “It is a complex issue,” she said, “and we try to address them so the students will become critical thinkers fully engaged in these debates and their world”Comments in the Gund guest book were overwhelmingly supportive. “Despite how unnerving, the photos are something people absolutely must see,” one visitor wrote.But at least one visitor criticized the show, writing, “This exhibit is lying leftist America-hating B.S.”Generally, the reaction to “Aftermath” has been positive. Although the Harn does not track attendance at discrete exhibits, 48,271 people visited the museum in the five months both “Aftermath” and “Portraits of Frida Kahlo” were up. (Eighteen classes from the University of Florida based discussions on “Aftermath.”) By comparison, a Monet and American Impressionism show that ran for a shorter time brought in slightly fewer visitors.', 'Lord & Taylor, WeWork and the Death of Leisure - The New York TimesThis past week, Hudson’s Bay, whose story begins 347 years ago in the fur trade, making it the oldest company in North America, announced that it was selling Lord & Taylor’s flagship store, on Fifth Avenue, several years after it had acquired the department store chain through a deal with a private-equity firm.The buyer would be WeWork, the office rental outfit very much rooted in the virtue-and-shell-game ethos of 21st-century capitalism. The founders Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey got together in a building on the Brooklyn waterfront where they both worked — Mr. Neumann as the proprietor of a company called Krawlers that produced padded clothes for babies — and quickly realized that they could make money from all the vacant space they saw around them by simulating the atmosphere of the Silicon Valley workplace, fueling the dreams of young entrepreneurs who always wanted to appear as if they were having fun. Over the summer, seven years into its existence, WeWork reached a $20 billion valuation.On the face of it, the transformation of a department store — the first in the country to install an elevator — into the headquarters of a start-up is simply a story of the new economy cannibalizing the old. Traditional retail businesses have been in decline for a long time; the cult of shared goods and services enabled by technology is ever ascendant.The first iteration of Lord & Taylor was a dry goods store on Catherine Street in Lower Manhattan that opened in 1826. The 676,000-square-foot Italianate building in Midtown it eventually occupied in 1914 (a building for which WeWork is now paying $850 million) stood not merely as a monument to turn-of-the-century commerce but also as the grand testament to what the sociologist Thorstein Veblen called the rising culture of “conspicuous leisure.”Leisure, Veblen wrote, “does not connote indolence or quiescence.’’ What it conveys is the “nonproductive consumption of time,” by which he was not anticipating the 10,000 hours people would fritter away playing Minecraft, but any time spent away from the activity of labor. In their infancy and well into the first 80 years or so of the 20th century, department stores were largely places to pass the hours. When Lord & Taylor opened on Fifth Avenue and 38th Street it featured three dining rooms, a manicure parlor for men and a mechanical horse that could walk, trot or canter. Harry Gordon Selfridge, founder of Selfridges in London, dictated that “a store should be a social center.” To that end he installed an ice rink and shooting range on the roof of his store and exhibited the first plane to fly over the English Channel.During this period, shopping as the consummate theatrical experience was memorialized in art. Florine Stettheimer’s 1921 painting “Spring Sale at Bendel’s,” to cite one example, shows us no cashiers, no scrambling for discounted Jazz Age style. In rich reds, it delivers the sense of a decadent party. Émile Zola’s novel “The Ladies’ Paradise” chronicled the rise of the Parisian department store in the 19th century, with its reading rooms and varied enticements.Today, of course, shopping is something else entirely, not a diversion but just an extension of our working or “productive” lives. At our desks and laptops we buy our avocados, face creams, bathing suits, boxer shorts, coffee tables, routers, sport coats, ski clothes. We can spend $53 or $8,500. There is nothing to immortalize unless you are a writer or artist moved to render the image of an exhausted-looking middle-aged woman staring at a screen-full of Amazon reviews.With the rise of the internet, shopping came to look like work, and work, in many instances, came to look like leisure, which is why WeWork’s purchase of the Lord & Taylor building has a resonance beyond the obvious. WeWork leases office space to small but growing companies, giving them shared access to communal rooms that look like lounges with bars, air-hockey tables, lemon-infused water and so on.“WeWork’s mission is to help people make a life, not just a living,’’ as one of its executives recently explained in a news release. The tech sensibility, which has leaked into so many other industries, imagines distinctions between work and private life as benighted. You are always working — posting to Instagram your vacation pictures in Bali, where you also happen to be sourcing materials for your new app-distributed small-furniture line — and you are always living.You could, in fact, build an entire social life around the WeWork experience. There are events all the time. Next week, for instance, a branch of WeWork in Dallas will hold a fashion show to benefit an animal protection charity. The show is to be followed by drinks, manicures and the opportunity to adopt a dog. There are WeWork offices in Haifa, Israel; Tokyo; Buenos Aires and 53 other cities now.Although the mourners are unlikely to be comforted, Lord & Taylor will not disappear entirely from New York’s streetscape; the famous Christmas windows should survive. Lord & Taylor will rent a quarter of the building, maintaining a smaller version of itself. WeWork will take over the rest for its headquarters and the leasing of shared office space — and tutorials perhaps for what is supposed to count now as a good time.', 'Not Just ‘West Side Story’: Celebrating Bernstein’s Symphonies - The New York TimesLeonard Bernstein is having the last laugh, the conductor Leon Botstein said recently from the stage of Carnegie Hall.Mr. Botstein was at Carnegie to lead his American Symphony Orchestra in Bernstein’s “Kaddish” Symphony, one of the ambitious concert works that earned him much snobbish criticism in his lifetime. But Mr. Botstein argued that these pieces, including three symphonies, have been steadily gaining respect and even entering the standard repertory.Though I love these scores, I wouldn’t go that far: Condescension endures toward Bernstein’s unabashedly theatrical symphonies. But there will be new chances to hear them, as international celebrations of what would have been Bernstein’s 100th birthday in August are already underway. (He died, at 72, in 1990.)The festivities include Bernstein’s Philharmonic, the New York Philharmonic’s three-week celebration of its beloved onetime music director, which starts on Wednesday. The symphonies are the centerpieces of the programs, conducted by Alan Gilbert and Leonard Slatkin; this will be one of the centennial’s most valuable opportunities to revisit these underappreciated works.Bernstein was clearly stung by the persistent criticism of his “serious” music by those who valued him as the composer of “Wonderful Town” and “West Side Story.” For all the anecdotes attesting to his substantial ego, he was also plagued by insecurity, something I got a glimpse of when I interviewed him in 1987 at Tanglewood.Bernstein was rehearsing a youth orchestra in Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring.” I attended every one of the exacting sessions and badly wanted to speak with him. But a salacious biography of him had recently been released and he was loath to meet with journalists. Thanks to the intercession of his longtime publicist, he warily allowed me backstage during a break.I thought that if he knew I was also a pianist, he might trust me more. So I mentioned having studied with Leonard Shure, with whom Bernstein had given a colossal performance of Brahms’s First Concerto on a Philharmonic program in 1960.It worked. “Ah, my old friend Leonard,” Bernstein said, relaxing.Then, looking at me a little suspiciously, he said: “You know, pianists don’t think I’m a real pianist.” Of course, he added, “conductors don’t think I’m a real conductor, and composers don’t think I’m a real composer.”It’s true that some thought the multifaceted Bernstein was a dilettante. And his insecurity about his compositions, which seemed genuine, was understandable: They were beaten up by critics, ignored by most orchestras and never really embraced by audiences.The Symphony No. 1, “Jeremiah,” completed in 1942 when he was just 24, was the best received of the three. The first movement, “Prophecy,” shows an impressionable Bernstein in thrall to Aaron Copland. But the precision and sting of the music, the steely blasts heaving with dissonance, display a feisty new voice eager to say something important. The second movement, “Profanation,” is a turbulent scherzo with hints of jazzy intensity. The symphony ends with a sternly anguished setting for mezzo-soprano of a Hebrew text from the Book of Lamentations.So far, so good. But Bernstein took a risky leap with his Symphony No. 2, “The Age of Anxiety,” a de facto piano concerto with a blazingly difficult solo part, written in 1949 (and revised in 1965). The title comes from the Auden poem about four lonely friends, a woman and three men, who convene at a New York bar and have an all-night rap session about life.The premise may seem pretentious for a composer to take on, and some said so. But Bernstein, already a Mahler devotee, was enamored of symphonic works that addressed cosmic questions and explored identity.Besides, you can listen to “The Age of Anxiety” knowing nothing about the narrative subtext (the piece is wholly instrumental) and be swept into this audacious symphony. A quizzical prologue sets up two long sets of intricate variations in myriad styles, with echoes of Neo-Classical Stravinsky and ironic Shostakovich. Eventually, a plunked-out piano theme leads into an angry dirge that breaks into an unabashed jazz romp, before the piece ends in a sweeping, cinematic epilogue. A bit much? Maybe. But it’s a voluble, big-hearted symphony.The “Kaddish” Symphony remains the most debated of the three. As he composed it during the early 1960s, Bernstein was alarmed by what seemed a looming threat of nuclear war.The core of this 42-minute work, scored for orchestra, chorus, children’s chorus and soprano soloist, is a setting of passages from the Jewish hymn of praise that is recited while mourning the dead. Yet the music is run through with a spoken text written by Bernstein in the confrontational manner of the Book of Job.Addressing God as “angry, wrinkled old majesty,” a speaker issues challenges with, he says, “respectful” fury to “you who make peace in the high places”: “Surely you can cause and command a touch of order here below.” Whole stretches of the text are spoken against backdrops that range from atmospheric choral humming to heated orchestra outbursts.Just as Bernstein was putting the final touches on the orchestration, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The shaken composer dedicated the piece to the fallen president. In places this darkly brooding score juxtaposes strands of 12-tone writing with crushingly poignant tonality, which raised hackles among modernist composers at the time. Many critics found the text preachy and embarrassing.Today, when tweets from the White House once again raise the specter of nuclear war, Bernstein’s text has new relevance. I was riveted by the performance Mr. Botstein led at Carnegie Hall. (Bernstein’s recordings of the symphonies with the New York Philharmonic, which he led from 1958 to 1969, are available as part of Sony’s 25-disc set “Bernstein the Composer,” released in March.)I’ve been thinking lately about my encounter with Bernstein at Tanglewood. I wish I’d told him that hearing him conduct the Philharmonic in “The Rite of Spring” in 1966, with Stravinsky in the audience, was a formative experience of my early musical life. And that in the realm of operetta, nothing, for me, tops “Candide.”And how much I admired his concert works — especially, as I’ve now come to realize, the “Kaddish.”', 'Lebanese Prime Minister Meets Macron After Mysterious Saudi Stay - The New York TimesPARIS — Lebanon’s absent prime minister arrived in France on Saturday morning after two weeks in Saudi Arabia, a mysterious stay that touched off intense speculation that he was being held against his will.The prime minister, Saad Hariri, who has not publicly explained the nature of his stay in Saudi Arabia, met with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for lunch at the Élysée Palace and confirmed that he would travel to Beirut later in the week.The meeting with Mr. Macron came hours after a phone call between Mr. Macron and the Lebanese president, Michel Aoun, the French president’s office said. Officials said that Mr. Aoun had thanked Mr. Macron for “France’s actions in favor of Lebanon” and confirmed that Mr. Hariri would be in Beirut for Lebanon’s Independence Day holiday, which is Wednesday.Mr. Hariri later said in statements to the news media that he would announce his position on the crisis in his country after holding talks with Mr. Aoun.“As you know, I have resigned and we will speak about this matter there,” Mr. Hariri told reporters, referring to Lebanon, as he was leaving the Élysée Palace, where he met with Mr. Macron for over 30 minutes, before gathering for lunch with his wife, their oldest son and Mr. Macron’s wife.After the meeting, officials in the French president’s office announced that Mr. Macron was considering gathering in Paris the members of the United Nations International Support Group for Lebanon, although no specific date was given.French officials refused to say whether Mr. Hariri had explained to Mr. Macron the reason for his mysterious stay in Saudi Arabia or the circumstances around the announcement of his resignation.Mr. Hariri’s office said earlier on Saturday that his wife, Lara, and their son Houssam would be present at the lunch in the Lebanese prime minister’s honor at the Élysée Palace. Mr. Hariri’s wife had accompanied him on the flight from Saudi Arabia, and his son was said to have flown in from Britain.Mr. Hariri’s two younger children, a 16-year-old daughter, Loulwa, and a 12-year-old son, Abdulaziz, did not appear in television footage of his arrival. The two have been attending school in Saudi Arabia and could have stayed behind for that reason, but their apparent absence was an obstacle to ending concerns that Mr. Hariri was not acting freely. It left room for speculation that the Saudis had pressured Mr. Hariri to leave them in the country as leverage.Mr. Hariri announced on Nov. 4 from Riyadh, the Saudi capital, that he was stepping down as Lebanon’s prime minister, but officials in Lebanon have said that his departure would not take effect until he delivered his resignation in person in Beirut.Mr. Hariri’s unexpected trip and resignation unsettled the Middle East, setting off a political crisis in Lebanon and even raising fears of war. Saudi Arabia was widely seen as pressuring Mr. Hariri to resign as part of its escalating regional feud with Iran and its effort to isolate Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia and political party that is part of Mr. Hariri’s coalition government.Mr. Hariri said he feared for his safety in Lebanon.With European diplomats scrambling to defuse the crisis, France seized the role of mediator. Mr. Macron made a surprise visit to Riyadh on Nov. 9. A week later, the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, met Mr. Hariri in the Saudi capital.Mr. Macron’s deputy adviser on diplomacy also traveled from Paris to Lebanon during the crisis, while Mr. Macron was having “direct and frequent” contacts with leaders in the region, including President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, according to officials in the French president’s office.France has strong ties to Lebanon, where it was a former colonial ruler, and to the Hariri family.“It’s an occasion for France to show that it can be an intermediary and have a role in the crises of the Middle East,” Rima Tarabay, an adviser on European affairs for Mr. Hariri, said in a phone interview.But Ms. Tarabay added that the crisis went beyond Mr. Hariri’s announced resignation, which has plunged the political situation of Lebanon in uncertainty.“We are facing a very complex situation, not specifically tied to Saad’s personal issue, but regarding what is going to happen next,” Ms. Tarabay said, raising concerns about the potential “resurgence of violence in the region, and a war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.”At a European Union summit meeting on Friday, Mr. Macron told journalists that France did not want to choose sides in the Middle East, adding that “the role of France is to talk to everyone.” However, he urged Iran to pursue a “less aggressive regional strategy.”On Saturday, Mr. Hariri met at his residence in France with two of his closest advisers, Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk and Nader Hariri, a senior aide. Many of the prime minister’s most trusted advisers had been out of touch or only in rare contact with him during his Saudi stay.At 1:10 a.m. on Saturday in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Hariri wrote on Twitter that he was “on the way to the airport.” His tweet mentioned Sigmar Gabriel, the foreign minister of Germany, who had asked whether the Saudis were holding Mr. Hariri.Saudi Arabia later said on Saturday that it would formally protest Mr. Gabriel’s remarks and that it would recall its ambassador to Germany.Mr. Hariri had arrived in Riyadh just as Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, put many of the country’s most wealthy and powerful men, including some members of the royal family, under de facto arrest in what has been described as an anti-corruption sweep.His visit also came as the Saudis accused Iran-backed rebels in Yemen of firing a missile at Riyadh. It was not clear if Mr. Hariri’s trip was related to these events.In Lebanon, many questions remain, including whether Mr. Hariri will hand in his resignation or rescind it, and whether the government will be reorganized.“The crisis of the resignation and Hariri’s return is now finished, but a political crisis has just begun,” Lebanon’s Parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, said on Friday after news emerged that Mr. Hariri would fly to Paris.Regardless of his next moves, Mr. Hariri will remain beholden to Saudi Arabia. His personal and family finances are deeply entwined with the country, which has also backed his party’s extensive political patronage network and media outlets. But the Saudi gambit to get him to take a more confrontational approach against Iran and Hezbollah could backfire.Mr. Hariri could end up presiding over a caretaker government ahead of elections planned for next year. Analysts and diplomats said that Saudi Arabia was likely to gain little more than a renewed rhetorical commitment from all sides to Lebanese neutrality.Tension had been building during the year since Mr. Hariri formed a national unity government in a deal that brought Mr. Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, to the presidency.Hezbollah gained new power and weaponry while helping President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, another Iran ally, beat back insurgents. Mr. Aoun began signaling plans to normalize relations with the Syrian government, with members of his party even meeting with Syrian diplomats in New York during the annual General Assembly gatherings. That was too much for some of Mr. Hariri’s allies and supporters, and for Riyadh.Mr. Hariri reached out to Jordan with a request to go to Amman as a safe haven, a Western official said. The request was denied, the official said, because the Saudis had pressured Jordan not to accept him.A spokeswoman at the Embassy of Jordan in Washington denied that such a request had been made.Assessing what Mr. Hariri’s stay in France would mean for the crisis in Lebanon going forward, an official in the French president’s office said the move had likely contributed to easing the current tensions but was unlikely, he added, to bring them to any definitive conclusion.', 'Earthquake Strikes Southeastern Iran - The New York TimesA magnitude-6.0 earthquake struck southeastern Iran near the city of Kerman on Friday morning, the United States Geological Survey said.The quake, initially reported as magnitude 6.3, was centered 36 miles northeast of Kerman, a city of more than 821,000. It was very shallow, at a depth of 6.2 miles, which would have amplified the shaking.A magnitude-6.0 quake is considered strong and capable of causing severe damage.', 'Rebeccah Heinrichs of the Hudson Institute weighs in on \'America\'s News HQ\'President Trump accused Iran of collaborating with North Korea to strengthen their missile technology Saturday evening in a Twitter post criticizing the 2015 nuclear agreement between the U.S., Iran and five other nations."Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel," Trump wrote. "They are also working with North Korea. Not much of an agreement we have!"Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!Nonproliferation experts have long suspected North Korea and Iran are sharing know-how when it comes to their rogue missile programs. Earlier this month, CIA Director Mike Pompeo told Fox News\' "Special Report with Bret Baier" that Iran would "certainly be someone who would be willing to pay" for that expertise."The North Koreans have a long history of being proliferators and sharing their knowledge, their technology, their capacities around the world," Pompeo said. "As North Korea continues to improve its ability to do longer-range missiles and to put nuclear weapons on those missiles, it is very unlikely if they get that capability that they wouldn\'t share it with lots of folks."Trump posted the tweet hours after Iran claimed to have successfully tested a new ballistic missile capable of reaching parts of the Middle East, including Israel.The missile, known as the Khoramshahr, has a range of 1,250 miles and is based on a North Korean design. A similar missile was tested in late January and blew up 600 miles after launch.The Iranian test-launch constituted a direct challenge to Trump, who last month signed a bill imposing mandatory penalties on those involved in Iran\'s ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them.Trump has vowed repeatedly to take a tougher line toward Iran than his predecessor, threatening at various times to renegotiate or even dismantle the nuclear deal, and shoot Iranian boats out of the water if they provoke U.S. naval vessels in the Persian Gulf.On Wednesday, Trump told reporters that he had made a decision about whether or not to pull out of the nuclear deal, but declined to say what it was.Earlier this week, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani vowed Iran would strengthen its missile capabilities without asking for any country’s permission, just days after Trump accused Iran in an address to the United Nations General Assembly of exporting violence to Yemen, Syria, and other parts of the Middle East.In that speech, Trump criticized the nuclear deal as "one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.""Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States," the president proclaimed, "and I don’t think you’ve heard the last of it, believe me."The nuclear deal between Iran and world powers does not strictly prohibit Iran from developing missiles but after the deal came into effect last year, the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution calling on Iran not to take any actions related to ballistic missiles "designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons" for eight years.Iranian officials have argued that the measure only applies to missiles specifically designed to carry nuclear warheads.Fox News\' Lucas Tomlinson and the Associated Press contributed to this report.', '                                    U.S. Sen.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., called on the Trump administration to decertify the 2015 accord.Cotton, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told an audience at the Council of Foreign Relations that President Donald Trump was correct in calling the deal “a direct national security threat.”“Put simply, this deal only makes sense if you assume, contrary to all experience, that Iran will evolve into a peaceful, law-abiding regime in ten years,” Cotton said. “To put that differently, it was the Obama administration -- not its critics -- that based our Iran policy on a fanciful vision of regime change.”"Decertification" could lead Congress to reintroduce economic sanctions on Iran that were suspended under the deal. If that happens, Iran has threatened to walk away from the arrangement and restart activities that could take it closer to nuclear weapons.Trump has called the agreement one of America\'s "worst and most one-sided transactions" ever.Officials said what Trump hates most is a provision — known as the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act — that requires him to tell Congress every three months if Iran is meeting promises to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for broad international relief from oil, trade and financial sanctions.But Trump has said repeatedly that he doesn\'t want to certify Iranian compliance again after having done so twice already.“They are two different pieces,” Mattis said, referring to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act and the international agreement. “I’ve been dealing with the president and the secretary of state and it is being considered in terms of security for the U.S. — the law plus the agreement.”Trump declared last month that he made up his mind on what he’ll do next.Late last month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson suggested that the president had made his decision on whether to withdraw from the agreement but had not shared that decision “externally.”Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, "Iran is not in material breach of the agreement and I do believe the agreement to date has delayed the development of a nuclear capability by Iran."The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump will say on Friday the Iran nuclear deal is no longer in America\'s national security interests, but he won\'t withdraw from the landmark 2015 accord or immediately re-impose sanctions, U.S. officials said.The announcement is essentially a compromise that allows Trump to condemn an accord that he has repeatedly denounced as the worst deal in American history. But he stops well short of torpedoing the pact, which was negotiated over 18 months by the Obama administration, European allies and others.Instead, Trump will kick the issue over to Congress, asking lawmakers to come up with new legislation that would automatically re-impose sanctions should Iran cross any one of numerous nuclear and non-nuclear "trigger points," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said in remarks released ahead of Trump\'s announcement.Those "trigger points" would include violations of the deal involving illicit atomic work or ballistic missile testing, support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon\'s Hezbollah movement and other groups that destabilize the region, human rights abuses and cyber warfare, they said.Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to snap the sanctions back into place, modify the law or do nothing. Any decision to re-impose sanctions would automatically kill America\'s participation in the deal.In a White House speech on Friday afternoon, Trump will notify Congress that he is "decertifying" the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, arguing that while Iran is complying with the letter of the agreement, the accord itself is not sufficient to be in U.S. interests."We don\'t dispute that they\'re under technical compliance," Tillerson said. "We\'ve said the agreement has a number of weaknesses in it, and, in fact, one of the weaknesses is the standard to remain in technical compliance is not that difficult, or has not been that difficult for them to meet."In remarks ahead of his address to a group of conservative voters, Trump previewed his position by calling Iran "a terrorist nation like few others" and urged his audience to listen in.Both defenders of the Iran nuclear deal and critics are likely to be displeased by Trump\'s decision. Those who support the deal believe Trump\'s move will badly damage U.S. credibility in future international negotiations, while opponents think he does not go far enough in unraveling the accord.Trump will urge lawmakers to codify tough new requirements for Tehran to continue to benefit from the sanctions relief that it won in exchange for curbing its atomic program, according to Tillerson. And he\'ll announce his long-anticipated intent to impose sanctions on Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard Corps by designating it a terrorist organization under an existing executive order."The reckless behavior of the Iranian regime, and the IRGC in particular, poses one of the most dangerous threats to the interests of the United States and to regional stability," the White House said in a statement. The statement denounced the Obama administration for its "myopic focus on Iran\'s nuclear program to the exclusion of the regime\'s many other malign activities" and said the same "mistakes" would not be repeated.Ali Larijani, Iran\'s parliament speaker, said Friday that any U.S. move against a nuclear deal with Iran would be an "insult" to the United Nations because the U.N. had given the deal its blessing.He added that any revision of the deal would allow Iran to take its own actions, and warned that the U.S. move could destabilize the international situation."We will continue to adhere to our obligations ... for as long as other parties observe the agreement," he said on a visit to Russia.In his speech, Trump also will ask Congress to amend or replace legislation that currently requires him to certify Iranian compliance every 90 days. Officials have said that Trump hates the requirement more than the nuclear deal itself because it forces him to take a position every three months on the deal. That frequency hassend also irritated aides who have complained that they are spending inordinate amounts of time on certification at the expense of other issues.American allies, who have pressed the White House to remain in the nuclear accord, will be closely watching the president\'s address. Trump wants to impress on the European parties to the accord — Germany, France and Britain — the importance of fixing what he sees as flaws in the nuclear accord and addressing malign behavior not covered in the agreement.The Europeans, along with the other parties, Iran, Russia and China, have ruled out reopening the deal. But some, notably France, have signaled a willingness to tackle unresolved issues in supplementary negotiations.Among those issues are the expiration of several restrictions on advanced nuclear activity under so-called "sunset clauses" that will allow Iran to begin ramping up its enrichment capabilities after 10 years, the end of an arms embargo and the eventual easing of demands for a halt to its missile program.In the speech, Trump hopes to "recruit" the Europeans into joining his broad strategy, particularly by punishing the Revolutionary Guard, which he and his national security team believe is fomenting instability, violence and extremism throughout the Middle East and beyond, according to one official.In anticipation of Trump\'s announcements, Republican legislators have drawn up a new version of the law replacing the current 90-day timetable with "semi-annual" certifications, according to drafts seen by the Associated Press this week.Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker said in a statement on Friday that his panel had agreed to fresh certification criteria to include items that are also the province of the U.N. nuclear watchdog and require the U.S. intelligence community to determine if Iran is carrying out illicit activity in facilities to which the International Atomic Energy Agency has not had access.___Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.', 'Iran Tests Ballistic Missile and Rejects ‘Threats’ - The New York TimesDUBAI — Iran said Saturday that it had successfully tested a new ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 kilometers, or about 1,200 miles, and would keep developing its arsenal despite pressure by the United States.The United States has imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its tests violate a United Nations resolution that calls on the country not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Iran says it has no such plans.Iran said in its announcement on Saturday that the missile could carry several warheads.The state broadcaster IRIB showed footage of the missile test without giving its time and location. It included video from an onboard camera, which the broadcaster said showed the detachment of the cone that carries multiple warheads.“You are seeing images of the successful test of the Khorramshahr ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 kilometers, the latest missile of our country,” IRIB said, adding that this was Iran’s third missile with such range.The Khorramshahr missile was first displayed at a military parade on Friday, during which President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would strengthen its missile capabilities.President Trump told the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday that Iran was building its missile capacity and accused it of exporting violence to Yemen, Syria and other parts of the Middle East.Mr. Trump also criticized the 2015 pact that the United States and other world powers struck with Iran under which Tehran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.Iran’s defense minister said Saturday that foreign pressures would not affect Iran’s missile program.“On the path to improve our country’s defensive capacity we will certainly not be the least affected by any threats and we won’t ask anyone’s permission,” the defense minister, Brig. Gen. Amir Hatami, said in remarks carried by state television.The United States says that Iran’s ballistic missile tests violate a United Nations resolution that endorsed the nuclear deal. Britain expressed similar concerns on Saturday.In a post on Twitter, Britain’s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, wrote: “Extremely concerned by reports of Iran missile test, which is inconsistent with UN resolution 2231. Call on Iran to halt provocative acts.”Iran denies that its missile development breaches the resolution and says its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons.Iranian state television said the Khorramshahr missile was “Iran’s most powerful missile for defense and retaliation against any aggressive enemy.”', "The president demanded the rogue regime give up its nuclear program and ripped Tehran for seeking to destabilize an entire region; John Roberts has the roundup for 'Special Report'President Trump just extended sanctions relief on Iran, but this does not mean he will certify that Iran is complying with the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) next month. He won’t, because doing so would mean lying to Congress.The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA), also known as Corker-Cardin, requires the president to certify that Iran is in compliance with JCPOA every 90 days. Trump has done that twice since he took office, but it was against his better instincts. He was very unhappy with his leadership for not giving him proper ammunition to do the right thing.But that won’t happen this time. There is plenty of proof that Iran is not complying, and the president has told his Cabinet leaders in no uncertain terms to bring him reasons for not certifying. The problem he has run into in the past has been the intelligence community’s assessment that Iran is technically in compliance, that they have no certain evidence of a material breach of the JCPOA.But Iran is in violation of a related agreement, UN Security Council Resolution 2231, through ballistic missile testing and export of weapons to Hezbollah and other terrorist groups. These violations are so flagrant even Samantha Power, Obama’s UN Ambassador, felt obligated to point them out. But the reason they can claim no certain evidence of violations is that the Obama administration gave away any right to conduct meaningful inspections in Iran. No one can get anywhere near the military sites where Iran does its dirty work. Also, in their naïve zeal to make a deal at any cost, President Obama’s negotiators took ballistic missile programs out of the agreement. A nuclear weapon needs a delivery system to be fully functional. Removing the missile program from the deal allowed Iran to keep working on half of its program and remain in technical compliance with the JCPOA.But Iran is in violation of a related agreement,UN Security Council Resolution 2231, through ballistic missile testing and export of weapons to Hezbollah and other terrorist groups. These violations are so flagrant even Samantha Power, Obama’s UN Ambassador, felt obligated to point them out. That is the opening Trump can use to announce that he can’t certify compliance with the deal. The INARA contains a provision (Page 129 STAT. 207) that says the president must certify that “Iran is transparently, verifiably, and fully implementing the agreement, including all related technical or additional agreements.”A UN Security Council resolution, directly applicable to the Iran nuclear program and negotiated by the Obama administration in conjunction with the JCPOA, absolutely counts as a related or additional agreement. The comical thing is that Obama loyalists are claiming it does not. When they submitted the JCPOA and all related agreements to Congress, as required by INARA, which President Obama signed, they included UNSCR 2231 as: (Other) not a related agreement.Seriously, that’s their excuse for why it should not be considered. That’s like saying the money they sent to Iran on an unmarked plane in the middle of the night wasn’t bribes and ransom because the pallets of cash were stenciled “humanitarian aid.” Well, maybe that’s not the best example, since they actually did claim that.Trump has every right, even an obligation, to identify UNSCR 2231 as a related agreement, and to tell Congress that he cannot certify compliance because Iran’s missile tests and weapons movements via commercial airlines are serial violations. This would set in motion numerous options for reapplying sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program. It should also prompt all elements of the U.S. government to fix, renegotiate or, ideally, eliminate the deal, and to take action to actually stop Iran’s nuclear program.The Iran deal was one of the worst negotiations in U.S. history. We gave away everything and gained almost nothing. Iran has moved forward with malign activity in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and, worst of all, its burgeoning nuclear and ballistic missile partnership with North Korea. By taking the first steps toward replacing this deal with actions that will keep us all safe, President Trump will be doing his sworn duty.All elements of U.S. power should be brought to bear, including a credible threat of military action if Iran doesn’t allow inspections at its military sites. We should also let the Iranian people know that we do not hold them responsible for the actions of the mullahs who oppress them and endanger the world. A new government for Iran would be in everyone’s interest.That or military action is the only thing that will stop Iran from finishing its plans to become a nuclear power. Expect President Trump to move us forward in that regard.Jim Hanson is President of Security Studies Group and served in US Army Special Forces.", '                                    A Ghadr-H missile, center, a Sejjil missile and a portrait of the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei are on display for the annual Defense Week, marking the 37th anniversary of the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, at Baharestan Sq. in Tehran, Iran, Sunday, Sept. 24, 2017                                                                            (AP)                                                                    Iran tried to obtain illicit technology that could be used for military nuclear and ballistic missile programs, raising questions about a possible violation of the 2015 agreement intended to stop Tehran’s drive to become an atomic armed power, according to three German intelligence reports obtainedby Fox News.The new intelligence, detailing reports from September and October and disclosed just ahead of President Trump’s planned announcement Thursday on whether the U.S. will recertify the Iran deal, reveals that Iran’s regime made “32 procurement attempts … that definitely or with high likelihood were undertaken for the benefit of proliferation programs.”According to the document, the 32 attempts took place in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The report lists Iran as a nation that engages in proliferation, which is defined as “spreading atomic, biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction.”Missile delivery systems are also included in the definition of illicit proliferation activity in the report.THE CASE FOR A \'CLEAN WITHDRAWAL\' FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEALThe North Rhine-Westphalia agency accused Iran of using front companies in the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and China to circumvent international restrictions on its nuclear and missile programs.The intelligence report, which covered the year 2016 — the Iran deal was implemented on Jan. 16, 2016 — calls further into question Iran’s compliance with the agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.The overwhelming majority of Iran’s illegal attempts covering the year 2016 in North Rhine-Westphalia encompassed technology for the clerical regime’s missile programs.The year before, the agency recorded 141 attempts by Iran to secure illicit goods for proliferation purposes.AS TRUMP CHALLENGES IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, THOSE IN TEHRAN WORRYIn a second intelligence report obtained by Fox News, the German state of Hessen said Iran, Pakistan, North Korea and Sudan use “guest academics” for illegal activities related to nuclear and other weapons programs. “An example for this type of activity occurred in the sector of electronic technology in connection with the implementation of the enrichment of uranium,” the document reads.The intelligence officials also cited an example of foreign intelligence services using “research exchanges at universities in the sector of biological and chemical procedures.”When asked about whether Iran was involved in the academic and research cases, a spokesman for Hessen’s intelligence agency declined to comment.In April, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told Fox News he’s “gravely concerned” about Iran’s role in helping Syria develop its chemical warfare program. Rubio, a Republican, said he was troubled by reports that both Iran and Russia were complicit in Syrian President Bashar Assad’s chemical weapons program.IRAN ISSUES THREAT OVER US STRIKES IN SYRIA“Congress and the White House should work together to hold the Assad regime accountable for its war crimes and impose harsh sanctions against its enablers,” Rubio told Fox News.A third intelligence report, from the state of Saxony-Anhalt, said Iran works “unabated” on its missile program.“With ballistic missiles and long-range rockets, Iran will be in the position to not only be able to threaten Europe,” it says.Iranian Arabs who are members of the paramilitary Basij force march in a military parade marking the 37th anniversary of Iraq\'s 1980 invasion of Iran, in front of the shrine of late revolutionary founder Ayatollah Khomeini, just outside Tehran, Iran, Friday, Sept. 22, 2017.(AP)United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution 2231 notes that “activities with Iran for nuclear and non-nuclear civilian end uses” should be sent to a technical UN working group on procurement.When asked if Germany reported the illicit exports and the unlawful attempts to the UNSC, German diplomats told Fox News: "We have no indication of Iran violating its JCPOA commitments. Quite on the contrary, the recent 2016 Report of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution states that there is no evidence of Iran violating the JCPOA."Having said that, we remain worried by Iran’s missile program. The aforementioned report, as well as reports from regional intelligence authorities, shows that Germany is highly vigilant in this regard and will continue to do so.However, this issue is outside the scope of the JCPOA and needs to be dealt with separately."David Albright and Andrea Stricker, two experts on Iran’s nuclear program at the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, wrote in April that the UN’s “Procurement Channel is a potentially valuable transparency and verification condition in the JCPOA, aimed at controlling the export of goods to Iran’s authorized nuclear programs and non-nuclear, civil end uses.”The experts added, “It seeks to deny Iran opportunities, or at least help expose any efforts, to violate the JCPOA and increase the transparency of Iran’s nuclear programs.”Sigmar Gabriel, the outgoing Social Democrat foreign minister of Germany, has made several trips to Iran since 2015 to boost trade with Tehran.

Follow him on Twitter @BenWeinthal', 'Ehud Barak, Israeli Hawk and No Friend of Iran, Urges Trump to Keep Nuclear Deal - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — Ehud Barak, the former Israeli leader known for his hawkish views on Iran, said it would be a “mistake” for President Trump to decertify the Iran nuclear deal, both because it would play to Iran’s advantage and because it would scuttle any hope of a negotiation with North Korea.Mr. Barak, a decorated soldier who was prime minister and defense minister, is the latest and most prominent Israeli to urge Mr. Trump not to disavow the deal — a step the president is expected to take when he announces his broader strategy for dealing with Iran later this week.“Even if America decides to pull out of it,” Mr. Barak said in an interview on Tuesday, “no one will join — not the Chinese, not the Russians, not even the Europeans. It will serve the Iranians.”Iran, he pointed out, is complying with the terms of the agreement. It will “continue to harvest” the economic benefits of the deal. But if Mr. Trump disavowed it, that would give the Iranians a pretext for resuming their drive toward a nuclear “breakout” capability, particularly in the latter years of the agreement, when the economic benefits are outweighed by Iran’s desire to join the club of nuclear states.The lessons of a broken deal will not be lost on North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, Mr. Barak said. “They will say it makes no sense negotiating with the Americans if they can pull out of a deal that has been signed, unilaterally, after a relatively short time.”An unconstrained North Korea could impel Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons, he said. In the Middle East, Iran’s renewed drive for a bomb would pressure neighbors like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey to do likewise.“Think what happens in the next generation if Iran turns nuclear,” he said. “It’s become almost inevitable that we are entering a totally different international landscape.”As Mr. Trump’s expected decision draws closer, other prominent Israelis are urging him not to decline to certify the agreement. Uzi Arad, a former top Mossad official who served as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser, traveled to Washington last week to lobby Republicans on Capitol Hill to preserve the agreement.On Tuesday, Condoleezza Rice, who served as President George W. Bush’s secretary of state, added her voice to those urging Mr. Trump not to disavow the deal, which was negotiated by the Obama administration. “The United States wants to be seen as living up to the obligations that it’s undertaken from president to president to president,” she said on Fox News.Mr. Barak’s advocacy for the deal is particularly significant because, as Israel’s defense minister from 2007 to 2013, he led the preparations for a possible military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities. He warned then that if the Israelis did not act at some point, Iran’s effort to produce a bomb would no longer be vulnerable to any military action.He and Mr. Netanyahu were closely aligned in that view, but they faced resistance from the chiefs of Israel’s intelligence agencies, who argued that a military strike could have catastrophic consequences and that they were exaggerating the imminence of the Iranian threat.President Barack Obama implored Mr. Netanyahu to give American efforts at pressure and diplomacy time to work, which he did grudgingly. But the prime minister never liked the resulting agreement. He lobbied against it in the United States Congress and encouraged Mr. Trump to try to renegotiate its terms. (Israel is not part of the deal.)“Change it, or cancel it,” Mr. Netanyahu said at the United Nations last month. “Fix it, or nix it.”Under the action being contemplated by the White House, Mr. Trump would essentially kick the agreement to Congress, which would have to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran — a step that would almost certainly blow up the deal — or use the threat of renewed sanctions to try to force the Iranians to renegotiate parts of the agreement.“Like many Israelis,” Mr. Barak said, “I think the Iran deal is a bad deal. But it is a done deal.”With the agreement in place, he said, “Iran is far from being an existential threat to Israel.” But he added, “It carries all the potential of turning into an existential threat in the longer-term” — a scenario made more, not less likely, by walking away from the deal, he said.While refusing to certify the agreement would be politically satisfying for Mr. Trump, Mr. Barak said, it would also not help the United States in its campaign to curb Iran’s ballistic missile program, its support for terrorist organizations, or its cyberwarfare operations.For Mr. Barak, the implications for North Korea are just as far-reaching. The United States, he said, had no military option to destroy the North’s nuclear facilities because of the massive retaliation that the North Korean leader would inflict on South Korea. That leaves only a strategy of negotiations, backed by sanctions, to coerce the North to curb its behavior.“Kim Jong-un is extreme,” Mr. Barak said. “But he is totally predictable and almost transparent — simple to understand. He just doesn’t want to experience what happened to Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein. Basically, there is no way he will give up his nuclear intentions.”Mr. Barak, now 75 and a nonresident senior fellow at the Belfer Center at Harvard, said the bellicose threats between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump raised the risks of a miscalculation that could lead to war.“No one personally remembers the Cuban crisis or the Berlin crisis,” he said. “People at the leadership level don’t have the fingertip feel for how easily the world situation can cascade.”', 'WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump plans to deliver a broad and harsh critique of Iran in a speech Friday declaring that the landmark Iran nuclear deal is not in America\'s national security interests, according to U.S. officials and outside advisers to the administration.Trump\'s speech from the White House will outline specific faults he finds in the 2015 accord but will also focus on an array of Iran\'s troubling non-nuclear activities, four officials and advisers said. Those include Tehran\'s ballistic missile program, support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon\'s Hezbollah movement and other groups that destabilize the region.Under U.S. law, Trump faces a Sunday deadline to notify Congress whether Iran is complying with the accord that was painstakingly negotiated over 18 months by the Obama administration and determine if it remains a national security priority. Although Trump intends to say Iran is living up to the letter of the agreement, he will make the case that the deal is fatally flawed and that its non-nuclear behavior violates the spirit of the regional stability it was intended to encourage, the officials and advisers said.The officials and advisers, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly preview the speech, said Trump will not call for a re-imposition of nuclear sanctions on Tehran. He will urge lawmakers to codify tough new requirements for Tehran to continue to benefit from the sanctions relief that it won in exchange for curbing its atomic program. And he\'ll announce his long-anticipated intent to impose sanctions on Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard Corps by designating it a terrorist organization under an existing executive order, according to the officials and advisers.In addition, Trump will ask Congress to amend or replace outright the legislation that currently requires him to certify Iranian compliance every 90 days. Officials have said that Trump hates the requirement more than the nuclear deal itself because it forces him to take a position on what he has denounced as the worst deal in American history every three months. That frequency has also irritated aides who have complained that they are spending inordinate amounts of time on certification at the expense other issues.At the White House, Trump\'s chief of staff, John Kelly, confirmed the president would announce the results of his Iran policy review on Friday but declined to offer any detail. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was calling foreign minister colleagues from the other parties to the deal to brief them on what to expect, the State Department said.But in a possible preview of Trump\'s announcement, CIA Director Mike Pompeo blasted Iran during a speech at the University of Texas, calling Iran\'s Ministry of Intelligence and Revolutionary Guard "cudgels of a despotic theocracy."The IRGC, which is responsible for external operations, is expanding its power across the Middle East, Pompeo said. "Unlike ISIS and its mirage of a caliphate, Iran is now a powerful nation-state that remains the world\'s largest state sponsor of terror."White House aides initially sought a venue for Trump\'s address that would project American power and determination. The shuttered former Iranian embassy in Washington was briefly considered before being deemed inappropriate. Officials also considered the Iwo Jima Marine Corps Memorial, which was ruled out because it is currently being renovated.American allies, who have pressed the White House to remain in the nuclear accord, will be closely watching the president\'s address. Trump wants to impress on the European parties to the accord — Germany, France and Britain — the importance of fixing what he sees as flaws in the nuclear accord and addressing malign behavior not covered in the agreement.The Europeans, along with the other parties, Iran, Russia and China, have ruled out reopening the deal. But some, notably France, have signaled a willingness to tackle unresolved issues in supplementary negotiations. Among those issues are the expiration of several restrictions on advanced nuclear activity under so-called "sunset clauses" that will allow Iran to begin ramping up its enrichment capabilities after 10 years, the end of an arms embargo and the eventual easing of demands for a halt to its missile program.In the speech, Trump hopes to "recruit" the Europeans into joining his broad strategy, particularly by punishing the Revolutionary Guard, which he and his national security team believe is fomenting instability, violence and extremism throughout the Middle East and beyond, according to one official.In anticipation of Trump\'s announcements, Republican legislators have drawn up new versions of the law replacing the current 90-day timetable with "semi-annual" certifications, according to two drafts seen by the Associated Press this week.Both drafts, one from Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker., and one from committee member and harsh deal critic Sen. Tom Cotton, expand the U.S. certification criteria to include items that are also the province of the U.N. nuclear watchdog and require the U.S. intelligence community to determine if Iran is carrying out illicit activity in facilities to which the International Atomic Energy Agency has not had access.The certification would also demand that the intelligence community produce judgments on Iranian behavior not covered by the nuclear deal, including missile testing and development, backing for Hezbollah and Assad and threats to Israel and the Mideast more broadly, according to the drafts.___Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.', 'Iran\'s supreme leader supports country\'s recent missile testsFollowing an announcement that Iran would cap the flight range of its ballistic missiles at about 1,200 miles, a top Iranian military commander said Tuesday that all U.S. military bases in the region could still be struck.Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, added that Iran had the capability to expand its missile range beyond that limit, the Washington Free Beacon reported, citing information from U.S. officials and regional reports.The range limit was reportedly set by Iran\'s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The comments by Jafari appeared to be an effort by Iranian authorities to contrast their missile program, which they often describe as being for defensive purposes, against those of countries like North Korea, which has talked about launching missiles that can hit any U.S. city.Speaking on the sidelines of a conference in Tehran, Jafari told journalists that the capability of Iran\'s ballistic missiles was "enough for now."Jafari said he didn’t believe that the U.S. and Iran would go to war anytime soon, though some may question his reasoning.Referring to the United States, he said: "They know that if they begin a war between Iran and the United States, they will definitely be the main losers and their victory will by no means be guaranteed. Therefore, they won\'t start a war."The Associated Press contributed to this report.', "Why aren't missiles and military sites part of the current deal?President Donald Trump followed up his Iran speech announcing that he would not be certifying the Iran nuclear deal by also making clear his administration stood in solidarity with ordinary Iranians. Just two days later, thousands of Iranians marched against the regime over charges of corruption. Some experts say the protesters were newly emboldened by Trump’s speech.Speaking exclusively to Fox News before the protests, Maryam Rajavi, the head of that country’s most visibly active opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), said that Trump’s new policy toward Iran gives ordinary Iranians hope.“The Iranian people welcome a new approach by the U.S. government, recognizing the suffering of the Iranian people under the regime, ending years of misguided policy and siding with the Iranian people in their desire for regime change and the establishment of freedom and democracy,” she said in a recorded statement from her exiled headquarters near Paris.Rajavi is seen by some Iran watchers as one someone the White House should be engaging with on Iran’s future.Heshmat Alavi, an Iranian political and rights activist said that Rajavi enjoys vast support in Iran.“Mrs. Rajavi is the voice of a very restive society, described as a ‘powder keg’ by many, seen so vividly in the growing protests by the younger generation, women and most recently by thousands of investors across the country who have trusted their life savings into government institutions, only to be robbed of all their assets,” he said.Alavi said dissent against the clerical regime is growing especially given recent allegations that the regime took investors for their lifesavings.TRUMP DECERTIFIES IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL“Sunday afternoon Tehran witnessed a demonstration by thousands of people chanting, ‘We don’t want a government of sheikhs,’ expressing their dissent with the ruling regime in its entirety,” he said.Walid Phares, a Fox News national security and foreign policy expert, said that while the Obama administration abandoned Iranian protesters in 2009, preferring to engage with the regime, President Trump has a different goal.“This narrative is rekindling hopes among young Iranians that the new administrator is changing the tone. Interestingly President Trump spoke of the Iranian people and how it is oppressed by the regime just few days ago. With satellite TV and social media, millions of Iranians captured the new messaging. Did that influence the several demonstrations that took place over the past weekend in Tehran and other locations —highly possible. Iran civil society is moving again and they know there is a different White House,” Phares said.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a veteran Middle East analyst close to the White House told Fox News that the Trump administration wants the Iranian people to know they are targeting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC) and not the people.“They know Iran is a rich and ancient civilization and that the Iranian people were the first victims of the regime. They’re not going to make excuses for the IRGC regime like the Obama team did. That was a huge part of President Trump’s speeches at the U.N. and last week.”Trump also designated the IRGC for its terrorist activities in last week’s speech on Iran.In her comments to Fox News, Rajavi called for regime change and for governments to recognize her group as a more enlightened replacement to the regime.“It is imperative that the National Council of Resistance of Iran be recognized as the democratic alternative to the terrorist dictatorship ruling Iran. Such recognition would rectify decades of a misguided U.S. policy regarding the Iranian people,” she continued.“Dissent has grown significantly among the Iranian people, especially among women and young people. Regime change by the Iranian people and resistance is within reach,” she told Fox News.So far it is believed that the Trump administration has not reached out to any of the Iranian opposition groups. Most of that outreach ended with the Obama administration because of its intense focus on Obama’s quest to make a deal with the Iranian regime.Ben Evansky reports for Fox Newson the United Nations and international affairs.He can befollowed@BenEvansky", '                                    Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri slammed Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group for meddling in Arab affairs and says "Iran\'s arms in the region will be cut off."

Officials say what Trump hates most, however, is a provision in a 2015 U.S. law — known as the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act — that requires him to tell Congress every three months if Iran is meeting promises to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for broad international relief from oil, trade and financial sanctions.Because the U.N. nuclear watchdog has found Iran in compliance, it\'s difficult for the U.S. administration to say otherwise.But Trump has said repeatedly that he doesn\'t want to certify Iranian compliance again after having done so twice already, declaring last month he even had made his mind up about what he\'ll do next. "Decertification" could lead Congress to reintroduce economic sanctions on Iran that were suspended under the deal. If that happens, Iran has threatened to walk away from the arrangement and restart activities that could take it closer to nuclear weapons."Iran is not in material breach of the agreement and I do believe the agreement to date has delayed the development of a nuclear capability by Iran," Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.Asked if he believed staying in the deal was in America\'s national security interest, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said, "Yes, senator, I do."For U.S. officials involved in the decision-making process, the focus on finding a way for Trump to avoid anything looking like approval for the accord has become a source of frustration. Various options are in play to resolve the problem, but none are clean solutions, according to officials who weren\'t authorized to discuss the private deliberations and demanded anonymity.The most likely strategy centers on Trump not certifying Iran\'s compliance when he faces another deadline Oct. 15. Below the president, diplomats and officials would then strive to manage any fallout with Tehran and America\'s European allies by emphasizing that the U.S. isn\'t leaving the deal or applying new nuclear sanctions on Iran. After that, Trump wouldn\'t have to address the certification matter again, officials said.The State Department and National Security Council declined to comment for this story.The Iran review law provides a potential out for Trump. The president must determine that Iran is implementing the nuclear deal and hasn\'t committed a "material breach," or taken action that could advance its nuclear weapons program. It also demands the president\'s verdict on a fourth question: whether suspending sanctions is "appropriate and proportionate," and if doing so is "vital to the national security interests of the United States."Mattis hinted his boss may try to decertify without breaking the deal."You can talk about the conditions under one of those, and not walk away from the other," he said. "They\'re two different pieces."The goal would be to reinforce the administration\'s argument that Iran\'s technical compliance — meeting uranium stockpile limits, pouring cement into the core of a plutonium reactor and so on — doesn\'t mean it\'s living up to the "spirit" of the agreement. This lofty but ill-defined notion encompasses things not directly covered by the nuclear deal, such as Iran\'s missile development, threats to America\'s Middle East allies and support for U.S.-designated terrorist organizations.While Mattis described the issues of certification and upholding the deal as "different pieces," they overlap.If Trump declares the nuclear deal isn\'t in the nation\'s security interests, how will his administration stick to it? In January, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson must again waive multiple sets of sanctions on Iran, and the national security question is relevant to those decisions.As a possible solution, officials said the administration is weighing whether to send the question of sanctions back to Congress. But if lawmakers pass new economic penalties on Iran, the same risk to the overall deal applies.Other alternatives are being weighed, too, according to officials.One would involve Trump grudgingly certifying Iran\'s compliance a final time and then persuading Congress to change the law so he wouldn\'t have to do so again. Officials say this option is unlikely because no one expects already gridlocked lawmakers to pass anything quickly on so polarizing a topic — even if the objective isn\'t to save or destroy the deal, but help Trump avoid the discomfort of the certification process.A further, even more remote possibility, officials said, is Trump not saying anything in 12 days\' time. His silence would amount to decertification, but would seem to be the least Trumpian course of action for a president who has loudly and consistently railed against the merits of the deal.Close observers of the Iran deal, both for and against, say Trump may even deliver a major foreign policy speech outlining his decision.', 'Mattis Contradicts Trump on Iran Deal Ahead of Crucial Deadline - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — Days before President Trump has to make a critical decision on whether to hold up the Iran nuclear deal, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis openly split with him on abandoning the agreement, the second senior member of the president’s national security team to recently contradict him.Mr. Mattis told senators on Tuesday that it was in America’s interest to stick with the deal, which Mr. Trump has often dismissed as a “disaster.”“Absent indications to the contrary, it is something that the president should consider staying with,” Mr. Mattis told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee after being repeatedly pressed on the issue.The comments were the latest example of how Mr. Trump’s instincts on national security — to threaten North Korea with destruction and tear up an Iran accord that most experts and allies say is working — are running headlong into opposition from his own National Security Council.But rather than keep those arguments inside the White House Situation Room, where similar battles have played out over many presidencies, Mr. Trump’s key advisers are making no secret of their disagreements with their boss.Mr. Mattis came to office with well-established, hawkish views of Iran, whose support of Syria’s government and of Hezbollah, he believed, had cost American lives. But he has always taken the position that if he had to confront Iran, he would rather confront a non-nuclear Iran, and that the agreement was preventing the country from possessing or making enough bomb-grade material for a weapon.Asked on Capitol Hill on Tuesday whether he had changed his view, Mr. Mattis said he supports “the rigorous review that he has got going on right now.”When that answer did not satisfy the committee, Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, asked whether the defense secretary thought holding onto the nuclear pact is in the interest of the national security of the United States.Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine general, paused before replying: “Yes, senator, I do.”An administration official said that no difference existed between the president’s views and those of his secretary of defense on the Iran deal.But the evident dissonance between the president and his senior national security advisers has taken on greater consequence in the cases of Iran and North Korea, which are potentially questions of war or peace.Amid the simmering North Korean crisis, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters  in Beijing over the weekend that he was keeping “a couple, three channels open to Pyongyang” to defuse the situation. The next morning, he was slapped down by Mr. Trump, who read newspaper accounts of that conversation and tweeted “save your energy Rex,” complaining that Mr. Tillerson was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,” the president’s derisive nickname for Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.White House officials said Mr. Trump was angry that his secretary of state was suggesting it was time to talk with North Korea, when official administration policy is that the North must earn the right — by halting missile and nuclear tests for an unspecified period of time.It was hardly the first time that Mr. Tillerson, who is widely reported to be frustrated in the job, has publicly split with the president. In August, he conceded that he had argued in favor of keeping the Iran deal, saying he had “differences of views” from the president. At the same time, he acknowledged that Iran continued to support terrorism and was failing to comply with what he called “the spirit” of the agreement.At the meeting with reporters in the American ambassador’s residence in Beijing, Mr. Tillerson hinted he was pressing Mr. Trump to certify to Congress once again that Iran is in compliance with the agreement despite Mr. Trump’s declaration in August that he would have declared the country “noncompliant 180 days ago.”Mr. Trump must make that decision anew by Oct. 15. But his choice is not necessarily the final word on the deal. Even if he decertifies the agreement, Congress could hold back on restoring the economic sanctions that the United States agreed to ease in exchange for Iran halting its nuclear weapons program. If Congress did not act, the deal would be preserved.“I don’t want to suggest to you that we’re not going to stick with the Iranian deal,” Mr. Tillerson said. “The president will have to make that decision; ultimately, it’s what he wants to do.”Mr. Mattis told lawmakers on Tuesday that Tillerson was “probing opportunities to talk” with North Korea and sidestepped questions about the president’s tweets about his secretary of state.And at his confirmation hearing in January, Mr. Mattis described the Iran deal as flawed but said the United States should remain committed to it, and to working with the other nations that negotiated it: Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. “I think it is an imperfect arms control agreement — it’s not a friendship treaty,” Mr. Mattis said at the time. “But when America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.”In the first eight months of the Trump administration, Mr. Mattis has made a habit of navigating Trump’s bombast with measured — often seemingly contradictory — statements. He has warned about the potential for huge loss of life if the Korean crisis ended up resuming the war that ended in an armistice in 1953. Taken by surprise by the president’s tweet declaring a ban on transgender members of the military, he quietly got wording into the final executive order that gave him time to delay, or upend, the ban.Inside the Pentagon, Mr. Mattis and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., have told aides they are worried that abandoning the Iran deal could make it harder to convince North Korea that the United States would stick with any diplomatic agreement it might be able to reach to head off — or at least pause — the growing confrontation.General Dunford testified at the same hearing alongside Mr. Mattis, and while he did not take a position on the Iran deal, his description about whether Tehran is violating the accord was at odds with the administration’s talking points. He said Iran “is not in material breach” of the agreement and that it had “delayed the development of a nuclear capability by Iran.”White House officials, by contrast, have said that Iran was violating hortatory language in the agreement about fostering better relations, even if it is not reprocessing plutonium and enriching uranium, the two pathways to a bomb.Diplomacy Works, an Iran deal advocacy group run by former Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who negotiated the accord, lauded Mr. Mattis’s support for the pact.“The president’s most senior security adviser now joins the likes of the United States’ closest allies and the International Atomic Energy Association in confirming that the Iran nuclear deal is not only working, and that Iran is in compliance, but that it remains the best agreement to protect American interests,” the group said in a statement.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump repeatedly threatened to tear up the deal, and negotiate a better one. In August, Mr. Trump also said that Iran is “not in compliance with the agreement and they certainly are not in the spirit of the agreement in compliance.”', 'TEHRAN, Iran – As U.S. President Donald Trump threatens the Iran nuclear deal, those living in Tehran feel that an accord they have yet to benefit from may already be doomed, hardening their skepticism about America.Trump is set to deliver a speech on Iran this week in which he is expected to decline to certify Iran\'s compliance in the landmark 2015 agreement, referring it to Congress, and perhaps targeting the country\'s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard with new sanctions.In the streets of the Iranian capital on Monday, The Associated Press spoke to a series of people about the nuclear deal: students and teachers, young and old, men in fashionable clothes and women in chadors.Nearly all had the same concerns: Benefits from the 2015 accord have yet to reach Iran\'s 80 million people despite its government signing billion-dollar airplane deals. Inflation remains high while job opportunities stay low.They also said Trump\'s threats fall in line with what Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic Revolution have warned: Americans can\'t be trusted. That feeling has unified hard-liners supporting Iran\'s clerically overseen government, as well as reformists seeking to change it."I have not seen any benefit from the deal, so what is Trump going to add to nothing?" asked Gholamreza Haeri, a 21-year-old architecture student. "Is he going to add zero to zero?"The faith of the average Iranian has eroded over time in the nuclear deal, which saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. It was sealed in July 2015 after 18 months of negotiations by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — the U.S., Britain, China, France and Russia — as well as Germany.In September 2015, a telephone survey by the Toronto-based opinion research firm IranPoll for the University of Maryland found 45 percent of 1,000 Iranians said they were not confident the U.S. would live up to its obligations in the nuclear deal. By September 2017, an IranPoll telephone survey of 700 urban Iranians found 77 percent were not confident. The margins of error for the polls were 3.1 percentage points and 3.7 percentage points respectively."The trend has continuously been increasing," said Amir Farmanesh, the president and CEO of IranPoll.That suspicion extended to Tehran\'s streets Monday. Bahram Safari, a 39-year-old junior high school teacher, said he initially supported the nuclear deal but slowly became disenchanted by Trump\'s constant attacks. Safari pointed to comments by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who repeatedly called the Americans untrustworthy during the negotiations."During the nuclear talks, I was wondering why the supreme leader was saying so, now I understand that he was right," Safari said. "Americans are not loyal to their signatures."Ashkan Ashtari, a 30-year-old electronics importer, said breaching the deal will be problematic for both sides."Iranians are worried about a breach of the nuclear deal because Iran has kept with all of its commitments and has been loyal to the agreement," he said. "Chances are that the U.S. president will break his country\'s commitment, as he has done so before."For Iranians, they still do not have access to international credit cards. While Iranian banks have reconnected to the SWIFT network, which allows for international wire transfers, many complain they still don\'t have access to global financial markets."I know that under the deal, Western banks were supposed to enter Iranian market, but they have not come in practice," said 31-year-old Zohreh Lavasani, who works at a private bank. "So I do not expect the new move by Trump can lead to a meaningful change."Iran\'s stock market dropped 1.2 percent in the last week as the price of hard currencies like dollars and euros edged up against the Iranian rial.Mehdi Abedi, a 30-year-old tire dealer, said despite the challenges, Iran could handle facing more U.S. sanctions."The world community is not just America. Iran can still continue its dealings with other countries," he said. "We have been at odds with the United States for about 40 years now and have managed to survive despite conflicts."Also on Monday, Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the top commander of the Revolutionary Guard, said in a statement that Iranian officials will have a "unified" approach toward the U.S. threats, the official IRNA news agency reported."Rest assured Mr. Trump that we (the Guard), foreign ministry and administration are united and our hearts are synchronized," the report quoted Jafari as saying.Some people continue to hold out hope for the nuclear deal. On Sunday, the German Embassy in Tehran put a placard on its wall saying: "Yes to Barjam" — nuclear deal in Farsi. Germany was involved in negotiating the agreement."I still want the deal to remain in place and both sides remain faithful to it so that we can finally see its positive impact on the lives of the people," said Hassan Aghaei, a 23-year-old street food vendor.But some saw fault in both sides."Iran\'s actions have probably provoked America, such as testing missiles and similar things," said Mehdi Shakeri, 42, who imports and sells car parts. "Iran could have dealt with Trump more cautiously because he is a radical leader and many of his actions are not always based on logic. Perhaps if Iran had not made Trump sensitive toward itself, we would not be in the situation we are today."___Associated Press writers Mohammad Nasiri in Tehran and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed.', "National security adviser previews President Trump's message to United Nations on 'Fox News Sunday'National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster on Sunday addressed President Trump’s decision last week to nix the Iran nuclear deal unless the rogue nation fully complies with the 2015 international pact, saying it’s not a “trustworthy regime” and that it has already “crossed the line several times.”Trump on Friday accused Iran of violating the Obama-era deal. However, the president didn’t terminate it or re-impose sanctions. Instead, he told Congress to toughen the law that governs U.S. participation while calling on the other parties to fix a series of deficiencies.“It's a weak deal that is being weakly monitored,” McMaster said on “Fox News Sunday.” “The president has made clear that he will not permit this deal to provide cover for what we know is a horrible regime to develop a nuclear weapon.”McMaster also argued that other nations that signed the deal agree with Trump about the changes and that Iran will need to renegotiate. “Our European allies already support much more rigorous reinforcement of [the deal] and more monitoring,” McMaster said.The landmark deal, signed in July 2015, prevents Iran from building a nuclear bomb. Iran, along with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council – the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia – agreed that sanctions that were in place for years would be lifted. The deal means Iran can receive billions of dollars in funds that were previously frozen and allow its markets to be re-opened to foreign investors, according to reports.“One of the real problems with this deal,” McMaster said, “is we can't really say with confidence that they [Iranian officials] are complying and we know from their behavior, probably in the region and their behavior within the agreement where they have walked up to the line, they have crossed the line several times in terms of the restrictions. This is not a trustworthy regime so much more comprehensive monitoring is in order.”McMaster added that Trump is not yet ready to walk away from the deal, and is waiting to see if there is real change or the ability of Congress to address the issues regarding monitoring Iran and whether the country is complying with the agreement.", '                                    Hillary Clinton appears at a book-signing event in New York City, June 10, 2014.

"We will have the Japanese, who understandably are worried with missiles flying over them as the North Koreans have done, that they can\'t count on America."Clinton stressed that a diplomatic solution was preferred, and suggested the inflammatory rhetoric played into Kim Jung Un\'s hands. She bemoaned Trump\'s public undercutting of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he tweeted "Save your energy, Rex" after the nation\'s top diplomat had suggested negotiations.“Diplomacy, preventing war, creating some deterrents is slow, hard-going, difficult work,” said Clinton, who declined to answer when asked whether Tillerson should resign.

Follow her on Twitter at @brookefoxnews.', 'The Iran Nuclear Deal Isn’t Worth Saving - The New York TimesJerusalem — “The only alternative to the Iran nuclear deal is war.” That is what the Obama administration and proponents of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran claimed in 2015. Nobody in the Middle East believed that the United States would ever strike Iran, but enough Americans did that the deal went through.President Trump has long opposed the deal, calling it one of the “worst and most one-sided transactions” ever. On Oct. 15, the president faces a deadline to recertify or decertify the agreement; various reports say he will opt for the latter. The deal’s defenders, horrified by this prospect, are once again warning of catastrophe. “Hard to see how abandoning” the Iran deal “doesn’t lead to war,” tweeted Samantha Power, a former ambassador to the United Nations.Such scare tactics were dishonest enough in 2015. Today, in view of the agreement’s ruinous consequences, they are morally indefensible.The alternative was never war, but a better deal. Rather than lifting sanctions on Iran, allowing it to retain its nuclear infrastructure and develop more advanced centrifuges, a better deal could have ramped up pressure on the Islamic Republic. This would have stripped Iran of capacities like uranium enrichment, which is unnecessary for a civilian energy program, and linked any deal to changes in Iran’s support for terrorism, its regional aggression and its gross violation of human rights at home.A better deal also would not have removed restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in 2025. That “sunset clause” is overlooked by the agreement’s proponents, who stress that Iran has so far complied with the deal. But why wouldn’t Iran comply right now? In a mere eight years it can reactivate its nuclear plants and rapidly enrich enough uranium for dozens of nuclear bombs. Instead of blocking Iran’s path to nuclear weapons, the agreement paves it.Supporters of the agreement further assert that it curbs Iran’s funding of terrorism and its threats against other states. Just the opposite has happened. With billions of dollars in sanctions relief, the regime is solidifying its rule over Syria, Iraq and Yemen, tightening its stranglehold on Lebanon, and increasing its bankrolling of Hezbollah and Hamas. And, in flagrant defiance of the United Nations, Iran is developing and testing intercontinental ballistic missiles that can carry multiple nuclear warheads. Meantime, the ayatollahs have pledged to destroy Israel and, ultimately, America. Rather than reducing the likelihood of war, the agreement has made many wars inevitable.In 2015, the agreement’s promoters insisted that the United States could no longer maintain an international front against Iran and that sanctions, set up to last indefinitely, would soon unravel. Now they predict that the international community will not follow America’s lead in withdrawing from the deal and reimposing sanctions. Worse, they warn, Iran might use the opportunity to evict United Nations inspectors and ramp up its nuclear program.All of these assumptions are false.Had American sanctions on Iran remained in place in 2015, companies would have had to choose between doing business with the United States, the world’s top-ranked economy by gross domestic product, and Iran, ranked 27th. That same stark choice will confront businesses if sanctions are reinstated.Similarly, the contention that Iran will rush to make nuclear weapons in the absence of an agreement is unfounded. Iran could have made that rush well before 2015 but it did not. The reason was the 2012 speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the United Nations General Assembly and the implicit military threat that backed it up.The world, he declared, must not allow Iran to amass enough highly enriched uranium to produce a nuclear bomb. “Red lines don’t lead to war,” he said. “Red lines prevent war.” That red line will remain indelible whether the deal is strengthened or canceled. What was true in 2015 holds equally today: The more credible the military option, the lesser the chance it will need to be used.The agreement’s apologists say that altering or negating the agreement will irreparably harm America’s prestige. Yet it is difficult to see how America’s status is served by a refusal to stand up to Iran’s complicity in the massacre of half a million Syrians and its efforts to annihilate American allies.Israel’s position on the Iran deal was and remains clear. “Fix it or nix it,” Prime Minister Netanyahu recently told the United Nations. If canceled, the deal must be replaced by crippling sanctions that force Iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons capacity. Fixing the deal would include conducting stricter inspections of suspect Iran nuclear sites, imposing harsher penalties for Iranian violations and, above all, eliminating the “sunset clause.”Either way, revisiting the agreement will send an unequivocal message to the world.

A more complete assessment was planned after daybreak, he said.In the provincial capital of Sulaimaniyah, the second-largest city in the Iraqi Kurdish region, residents described feeling heavy tremors but said there was no notable building damage. Residents in the oil-rich town of Kirkuk, located some 50 miles to the west, had similar reports.In Baghdad, the tremors were strong enough to shake bookcases and wall-mounted television screens, sending residents in several neighborhoods out into the street.

Gen. Jeffrey L. Harrigian, who oversees the Air Force\'s Central Command in Qatar, said remnants of the missile bore “Iranian markings.""To me, that connects the dots to Iran,” he told journalists at a news conference in Dubai ahead of the Dubai Air Show.Saudi Arabia long has accused Iran of giving weapons to the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, and their allies in the ongoing conflict in Yemen, though Tehran has just as long denied supplying them. Saudi Arabia supports the Yemen government, and the clashes between pro-government forces and the Houthis have become somewhat of a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, each of which have attempted to assert dominance throughout the region. "To me, that connects the dots to Iran."There was no immediate reaction from Tehran to Harrigan’s comments.Harrigian declined to offer any specifics on what type of missile U.S. officials believed had been fired toward the international airport, nor did he show any images of the debris after it was shot down by Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4. He also didn\'t explain how Iran would have evaded the blockade by the Saudi-led coalition, which intensified after the missile targeted Riyadh."How they got it there is probably something that will continue to be investigated over time," Harrigan said. "What has been demonstrated and shown based on the findings of that missile is that it had Iranian markings on it. That in itself provides evidence of where it came from."Saudi Arabia says it took down the missile near Riyadh\'s international airport, the deepest incursion yet by a missile into the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia\'s Foreign Ministry later said investigators examining the remains of the rocket found evidence proving "the role of Iranian regime in manufacturing them." It did not elaborate, though it also mentioned it found similar evidence after a July 22 missile launch. French President Emmanuel Macron similarly this week described the missile as "obviously" Iranian.The kingdom on Monday called the attempted attack an "act of war" by Iran and vowed to retaliate.SAUDI ARABIA VOWS RETALIATION FOR MISSILE LAUNCHThe attempted missile strike was "a blatant act of military aggression by the Iranian regime and could rise to be considered as an act of war," the Saudi Press Agency said in a statement.Saudi Arabia “reserves its right to respond to Iran in the appropriate time and manner, in accordance with international law and based on the right of self-defense," the statement continued.U.S. Air Forces Central Commander in Qatar, Lt.

He also assailed Iran’s Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, the Shiite militia and political party that is part of the national unity cabinet he led.“Wherever Iran settles, it sows discord, devastation and destruction, proven by its interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries,” Mr. Hariri said, adding that Iran’s “hands” in the region “will be cut off.”The surprise announcement — which shocked even his own staff — was an ominous sign of the escalating regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, analysts said, indicating the growing dominance of Iran and Hezbollah as well as the Saudis’ increasingly assertive response.Lebanese and regional analysts, whether supporters or opponents of Hezbollah, said it appeared that Mr. Hariri had been pressured to resign by his patrons, the Saudis, as they and the United States ratchet up efforts to counter Iranian influence. The resignation came after weeks of sharp American and Saudi condemnations of Iran, including from President Trump, and new American sanctions against Hezbollah.By pushing out Mr. Hariri, analysts said, Saudi Arabia could deny Hezbollah a credible Sunni governing partner — an attempt to isolate it and deny it the fig leaf of a national unity government.“They concluded that Hariri was serving as more of a cover for Iranian and Hezbollah influence than as a counterweight to them,” said Rob Malley, a former special Middle East adviser to President Barack Obama and the vice president of the International Crisis Group.Yet the resignation also shows how few options Iran’s opponents have. Without Mr. Hariri in power, the United States and Saudi Arabia lose their main partner in the Lebanese government.Across the political spectrum, analysts and officials said the resignation ushered in new dangers. If the next government is more pro-Hezbollah, they said, that could lead to devastating sanctions. It could even increase the chances of a new war with Israel, which would see added justification for its argument that there is little distinction between Hezbollah and the Lebanese state.Mr. Hariri even raised the specter of internal violence. He compared the atmosphere in Lebanon now to the days before the 2005 assassination of his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying he believed his own life was in danger. “I sensed what’s being woven in secret to target my life,” he said.Mr. Hariri’s father was killed when his motorcade was bombed on Beirut’s seafront. Several Hezbollah members are being tried in absentia in a special United Nations-backed tribunal in The Hague, although the militant group has denied involvement in the assassination.Saad Hariri became prime minister in late 2016, in a compromise deal after Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, became president, ending a two-and-a-half-year political deadlock.Lebanon, which is governed by a sect-based political system, has long been deeply divided between a bloc aligned with Shiite Hezbollah and Iran, and one aligned with Saudi Arabia, the dominant Sunni country in the region.Mr. Hariri headed a 30-member national unity cabinet that was crafted to protect the country from any spillover from the multisided war in neighboring Syria, where Iran backed the government and Saudi Arabia backed the insurgents.That mission has largely been successful, even though Hezbollah has sided with the Syrian government, Lebanese Sunni militants have joined insurgents there, and well over one million refugees flooded this small Mediterranean country.In Lebanon’s political system, power is divided between a prime minister, who must be Sunni; a president, who must be Maronite Christian; and a speaker of Parliament, who must be Shiite.The exercise of real power in the country is a more complicated affair of alliances, rivalries and division of spoils between the leaders of sectarian groups, including former warlords from Lebanon’s civil war.Hezbollah, which rose to prominence fighting the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon, is the strongest because of its powerful militia, which can act independently of the state and in recent years has served as an expeditionary force across Syria.In recent years Lebanon’s rival blocs have essentially agreed to confine their fight to Syria. But tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have only increased.In addition to Hezbollah’s decisive role in helping President Bashar al-Assad of Syria hold on to power, Iran has supported several militias in Iraq that have managed to defeat Islamic State forces in that country and remain a fighting force.Iranian leaders say their interference is needed to stop terrorism, and to create a security zone for their country. The country’s influence started to rise after the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq in 2011, leaving behind an incomplete army and a pro-Iranian government.Iran’s filling of the vacuum created by the departure of the United States military has been an extremely worrying development for Saudi Arabia and some other Arab states, who have seen their efforts to fight proxy wars with Iran largely fail.And now that the Syrian war seems to be entering a new phase, with Mr. Assad still ruling a devastated country, there are fears that tensions that had been pushed to the back burner — inside Lebanon, between Hezbollah and Israel, and elsewhere — could re-emerge.The United States has stepped up sanctions on Hezbollah in recent weeks after President Trump criticized Iran and the landmark nuclear deal it reached under Mr. Obama.“It signals a new phase of escalation,” said Ali Rizk, a pro-Hezbollah Lebanese analyst, adding that after the Islamic State is defeated, the United States will put new pressure on what it sees as Shiite extremists. “Lebanon is in for a hard time,” Mr. Rizk said.The resignation brought sharp words from Israel and Iran. Bahram Ghasemi, a spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, said Mr. Hariri’s speech was driven by a Saudi, American and Israeli effort aimed at “creating tension in Lebanon and the region.”And in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the resignation “a wake-up call for the international community to take action against the Iranian aggression.”The pressure now is on the Lebanese president, Mr. Aoun, who will hold consultations with Parliament about appointing a caretaker government, said Imad Salamey, an analyst at the Lebanese American University in Beirut.“If he indeed is going to bring in a pro-Hezbollah government, then he has to face the consequences,” such as new sanctions, Mr. Salamey said. “It will be a massive U.S. and Saudi response. The economy will collapse for sure.”In his speech, Mr. Hariri said he wanted to unite Lebanon and free it from outside influence. He pronounced himself “full of optimism and hope that Lebanon will be stronger, free, independent, with no authority over it except that of its own great people.”But in the streets of Tariq al-Jdeedeh, a mostly Sunni neighborhood of Beirut that is part of Mr. Hariri’s political base, anger and confusion contrasted with the posters of Mr. Hariri that festooned the buildings.“Hariri didn’t do this for Lebanon, he did this for Saudi against Iran,” said Nabil Idriss, who was tending his son’s fabric shop. “Now with this move, the picture is more transparent than ever. Saad Hariri was never in control.”', 'Fox News contributor says it would be \'irresponsible\' for the U.S. to walk away.President Trump will announce next week that he will "decertify" the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, the Washington Post reported Thursday.An administration source pushed back on the report to Fox News, saying that a decision on the agreement was "not fully baked."During a briefing with senior military leaders Thursday, Trump said Iran had "not lived up to the spirit of the agreement" and added the U.S. "must put an end to Iran\'s continued aggression."Trump has until Oct. 15 to tell Congress if he believes Iran is complying with the seven-nation pact."We\'re going to give [Trump] a couple of options of how to move forward to advance the important policy toward Iran," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters Wednesday.An announcement of decertification by Trump would not scrap the deal on its own. If he does decertify the deal, Congress could reintroduce economic sanctions on Iran that were suspended under the agreement. If that happens, Iran has threatened to walk away from the arrangement and restart activities that could take it closer to nuclear weapons.Trump and other U.S. officials, including Tillerson, have said Iran is violating the spirit of the agreement because of its testing of ballistic missiles, threats to U.S. allies in the Middle East, and support for U.S.-designated terrorist organizations and Syria\'s government.The president has called the deal, which forced Iran to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for broad relief from international economic sanctions, one of the nation\'s "worst and most one-sided transactions" ever. But many of his top national security aides don\'t want to dismantle the deal, and America\'s European allies have lobbied the Trump administration heavily not to walk away from the agreement.Under the 2015 Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, Trump must determine that Iran is implementing the nuclear deal and hasn\'t committed a "material breach," or taken action that could advance its nuclear weapons program. The law also demands the president\'s verdict on a fourth question: whether suspending sanctions is "appropriate and proportionate," and if doing so is "vital to the national security interests of the United States."On Tuesday, Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Iran "is not in material breach of the agreement." At the same hearing, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he believed the deal is still in the U.S. national security interest, but hinted that Trump may try to decertify without breaking the deal."You can talk about the conditions under one of those, and not walk away from the other," he said.Fox News\' John Roberts and the Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'Eric Shawn reports from New York CityThe Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen closed off the land, sea and air ports to the Arab world’s poorest country early Monday after a rebel-fired ballistic missile targeted Riyadh, blaming the launch on Iran and warning it could be “considered as an act of war.”The coalition’s statement ramps up tensions between the ultraconservative Sunni kingdom and its Shiite rival Iran, both of which have interests in Yemen’s yearslong conflict. The bloodshed continued Sunday as an Islamic State-claimed militant attack in Aden killed at least 17 people.In a statement, the coalition accused Iran of supplying Yemen’s Houthi rebels and their allies with the missile launched Saturday toward the Saudi capital’s international airport.Iran has backed the rebels, but denies arming them. The Houthi militants have said their Volcano-variant ballistic missile is locally produced.The Saudi-led coalition’s statement said the closures would be temporary and “take into account” the work of humanitarian and aid organizations. The war has claimed more than 10,000 lives and driven the Arab world’s poorest country to the brink of famine.The Saudi-led coalition launched a wave of airstrikes — starting overnight and continuing until noon Sunday — on the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, apparently in response to the ballistic missile. Saudi Arabia said it shot down the missile, with fragments landing in an uninhabited area north of the capital.The coalition threatened Iran with a possible retaliatory strike.“Iran’s role and its direct command of its Houthi proxy in this matter constitutes a clear act of aggression that targets neighboring countries, and threatens peace and security in the region and globally,” the statement said. “Therefore, the coalition’s command considers this a blatant act of military aggression by the Iranian regime, and could rise to be considered as an act of war against the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”The statement added: “The coalition command also affirms that the kingdom reserves its right to respond to Iran in the appropriate time and manner.”There was no immediate response from Iran, though Iran’s defense minister, Gen. Amir Hatami, earlier denied his country was involved in the launch.“Does anyone ask the United States what are you giving to Saudi Arabia?” he was quoted by the semi-official ISNA news agency as saying Sunday. The U.S. has offered logistical and targeting support to the Saudi-led coalition.President Donald Trump also was quick to blame Iran on Sunday. “A shot was just taken by Iran, in my opinion, at Saudi Arabia. And our system knocked it down,” Trump said, referring to the Patriot missile batteries Saudi Arabia purchased from the U.S.Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guard chief, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, said Iran can’t transfer rockets to Yemen and stressed that the missiles were made there. He described Trump’s comments as “lies.”The Houthis said in a statement that the missile was launched in response to bombings that have killed civilians. The Houthis have fired a number of missiles across the border in recent years, but this appeared to be the deepest strike yet within Saudi territory.Meanwhile in Aden, masked militants claimed by an Islamic State affiliate set off a large car bomb outside a security headquarters in Yemen’s southern port city early Sunday, killing at least 17 people before storming the compound, officials said. Fighting continued well into the night.Speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters, the security officials said the militants placed snipers on the roof and gunned down most of the security forces inside. The officials gave conflicting accounts of what happened next inside the building. They initially said that the militants had taken an unknown number of people hostage. Later they said that they opened cell gates and released prisoners.Security forces backed by an Apache helicopter continued to fight for control of the installation after nightfall, chasing down militants in the surrounding structures and neighborhood. Some hostages were killed, they added, without providing specific figures. They said at least five soldiers were among the dead.Witnesses said at least four militant snipers could be seen on the roof of the compound. They also described mayhem as dead bodies littering the compound’s front courtyard couldn’t be retrieved because of the continuous sniper fire. Shallal al-Shayae, the security chief, was not inside the compound at the time of the attack, the officials said.In an online statement, the local affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack saying they killed 50 soldiers and identified the bomber as Abu Othman al-Hadrami.Yemen is embroiled in a war between Iran-backed Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, and the internationally recognized government, which is allied with a Saudi-led military coalition. The government has been based in Saudi Arabia since the Houthis overran the capital Sanaa in 2014. Government forces ostensibly control Aden, but the city remains volatile.', "TEHRAN, Iran – The latest on magnitude 7.2 earthquake that hit Iran-Iraq border region (all times local):1:50 a.m.An Iranian official says at least 30 people died in Iran when a magnitude 7.2 earthquake hit near the Iran-Iraq border region.

Iraqi seismologist Abdul-Karim Abdullah Taqi, who runs the earthquake monitoring group at the state-run Meteorological Department, said the main reason for the lower casualty figure in Iraq was the angle and the direction of the fault line in this particular quake, as well as the nature of the Iraqi geological formations that could better absorb the shocks.Video captures bar patrons fleeing in Sulaymaniyah, Iraq, when a 7.3-magnitude #earthquake struck the city.

(AP)Iran sits on many major fault lines and is prone to near-daily quakes. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. The last major casualty earthquake in Iran struck in East Azerbaijan province in August 2012, killing over 300 people.The Iraqi city of Halabja, closest to the epicenter, is notorious for the 1988 chemical attack in which Saddam Hussein\'s regime killed some 5,000 people with mustard gas -- the deadliest chemical weapons attack ever against civilians.The Associated Press contributed to this story.', 'LONDON – A British woman jailed in Iran has spoken from prison to thank Britons trying to get her released.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe spoke to supporters at a London rally Saturday through a telephone and loudspeaker.She said that "I\'m so grateful for everybody\'s support and love," adding that her only goal is to return home to be with her family.The 38-year-old charity worker is a dual British-Iranian citizen who has been in prison in Iran since April 2016 after being accused of plotting against Iran\'s government.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has complicated matters by saying incorrectly that she was training journalists when arrested.

They live in a region traversed by fault lines, and the destruction that comes when the ground shakes is not something new. And still, no one in this region was ready for the heavy destruction and loss of life that occurred when the ground shook on Sunday night.There are more than 530 dead, a huge loss in itself, but coming to terms with so much death — and the damage to so many structures, in a region of small villages and towns, all at the same time — was that much harder. This earthquake in northwestern Iran was deadlier than the one that devastated Mexico City in September. Tremors were felt as far away as Turkey, Israel, Lebanon and Pakistan.A lone Shiite cleric, wearing a backpack, sandals and his traditional turban, wandered through the flattened village of Kuik-e Hasan on Tuesday. The cleric, Asgar Zarei, had come from the holy city of Qum with other volunteers to help out, but found himself lost in the destruction. “I’m trying to talk to people about God, give them peace of mind — that is all I can do,” he said. “And pray. One can always pray.”For the Iranian government, which is in a constant struggle to demonstrate that it can, and will, care for its citizens at times of crisis, the earthquake was a test of resources and capabilities. Citizens around Iran watched riveting news feeds on television and social media as survivors used backhoes and their hands to dig through debris in the search for survivors. But for the people in this region the struggle was more elemental — many are living in tents, huddled against the biting cold.The government knew it was being watched. The country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the quake “a divine test for officials and Iranians,” one that will determine “if they can carry out their duties.” President Hassan Rouhani visited the region and stopped in the worst-hit city, Sarpol-e Zahab, promising more help and low-interest loans to developers to rebuild collapsed apartment complexes.The president called the disaster “painful for all Iranians.”After receiving permission from the government to visit the disaster zone, I flew about 265 miles west from Tehran to the regional airport, in the city of Kermanshah. It was then a two-hour drive with an Iranian photographer, Arash Khamooshi, through rugged mountains to the city of Sarpol-e Zahab and the villages surrounding it.After two checkpoints, one manned by police officers in riot gear — protection against bandits, the government said — we hit the main road.

On the right was a series of apartment buildings; its balconies had fallen off. A mix of locals in busted-up cars, some with their windows broken from rubble, drove up and down. Soldiers from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in pickup trucks, and people bringing water, blankets and orange-flavored cakes from other cities, were also driving in.“I came for a funeral,” said Kamran Moradi, from nearby Qasr-e Shirin, the last city before the border with Iraq. “I have never seen anything like this,” he said.This is a region that is accustomed to tragedy. Its people have tasted the worst life can throw at them, many having survived eight years of war with neighboring Iraq. But they trusted. They thought they could rely on home always being there.“I have seen everything,” said Mohammad Nazari, a veteran of the 1980-88 war.He said he was slow to grasp the significance of the tremors on Sunday night in his hometown, the village of Zarrin Jub.Just after 9 p.m., Mr. Nazari had been focused on his favorite television show. The first tremor felt oddly familiar, he said, but not all that menacing: Jackie, a black guard dog, had already been barking for an hour. He thought the tremor his dog had noticed was one of the small jolts people regularly experience in earthquake-prone Iran.He went back inside to watch TV.Not long after, the walls started shaking. He ran for the hallway, slamming into the walls. Sakine, his wife, ran behind him. “In those seconds you only think of yourself, of surviving,” Mr. Nazari said.In the chaotic minutes following the quake, he was first overwhelmed with joy. “I am alive,” he recalled thinking over and over again. “Alive.”Around the country, people began to rally, to gather goods to distribute to those in need. While the government said it did not need outside assistance, Iranians pulled together. In Tehran, volunteers started online campaigns to gather food and blankets for the victims of the earthquake. “We want to make sure these people get the help they need,” said Pouria Gorji, a factory manager who supports Mr. Rouhani. “Our group is bringing 1,500 tents and 3,000 blankets. The government is overwhelmed.”“Let’s be honest, we don’t have proper crisis management, but we always send a lot of people to help,” said Nader Karimi Joni, a journalist. “We should start preparing for better ways to deal with such terrible events.”An official of the Red Cresent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Sarpol-e Zahab said that 10,000 family-size tents had been brought in, but that distributing them had turned into a scrimmage. Iranians without tents or any other form of shelter accused low-level officials and looters of hoarding tents with plans to sell them later for a profit.Mr. Nazari and several neighbors complained about their representative in Parliament, Farhad Tajari, who grew up in a village nearby. “Where is he?” Mr. Nazari asked. “Why is he not here? We voted for him and need him now.”Some were already preparing for the night. They had parked their cars on a flat space of land. “We sleep in our cars, the remains of our houses are too dangerous and instable with all the aftershocks,” Mr. Nazari said.In Kuik-e Hasan, where Mr. Yari recited the names of his loved ones, relatives arrived from Tehran with a car full of blankets and food. His grandmother sat on a carpet in front of what had been her house, surrounded by cans and plastic bottles. “We still haven’t gotten a tent,” Mr. Yari said.Others in his village were also frustrated, hoping the government would move faster.“They can start with tents,” said Shahram Moradi, a 35-year-old shoe repairman.Down the road a group of women sat on a carpet. They had neatly stacked up the bottles of water people had brought them, but feared the coming night. “Our 10-year-old boy Arman is still here under the rubble,” an older woman said, through her grief. “Tonight, we will sleep next to him.”In Zarrin Jub, mourners sat in rows of yellow and green plastic chairs laid out in a field of wheat stalks. Several of them cried, not just for the man whose life they were commemorating, but from the loss of their homes, their neighbors, their village.“He was a great and selfless guy,” said Zahra Eskandari, reflecting on her cousin, Cyrus Piri, who had been buried soon after his body was recovered from the rubble of his home. “He helped people whenever he could.”Before the quake, Mr. Piri was the man called on to help bury the dead. He would show up at his neighbors’ funerals to sing for free, using his rich bass voice to extol the virtues of revered Shiite figures.There was no one to sing at his funeral.', 'The defense secretary testified it\'s in America\'s interest to remain in the agreement; on \'Special Report\' Jennifer Griffin reports.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis testified Tuesday that the United States should remain in the Iran nuclear deal, as President Trump weighs whether to renew the controversial agreement ahead of an Oct. 15 deadline.The president has been highly critical of the Obama-era pact, as recently as last month calling it one of the "worst deals" he\'s ever seen.But Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford both indicated support for the agreement during a hearing Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee.Mattis was pressed by Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, on whether he thought there was a “national security interest” to remain in the Iran deal. “Yes, sir. I do,” Mattis said.Late last month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson suggested that the president had made his decision on whether to withdraw from the agreement but had not shared that decision “externally.”The president, who has twice re-certified the deal since taking office, has repeatedly slammed the arrangement. He told reporters last month that it\'s not "fair" and should never have been made.But Trump has not said whether he plans to re-certify Iran\'s compliance by the Oct. 15 deadline. Denying certification could lead the U.S. to reintroduce sanctions, which could lead Iran to walk away from the deal or even restart some nuclear activities it had engaged in prior to the 2015 agreement.Dunford testified Tuesday that Iran, however, is following the requirements of the deal.“The agreement right now, what I testified to last week, Iran is not in material breach of the agreement,” Dunford told lawmakers on the panel. “And I do believe the agreement, to date, has delayed the development of nuclear capability by Iran.”Mattis noted that while he believes it is in the best interest of the U.S. to abide by the nuclear deal, the administration is “very alert” to any “cheating” by the Iranians.“The amount of misconduct, I would call it, internationally, whether it be with ballistic missiles, rhetoric, support to terrorists, threats to our friends, Arab and Israel in the region by Iran, are areas that they are open to a great deal, I think, of censure by the international community,” Mattis said. “We are not naive about their agreement on the nuclear issue, and we are being very alert to any cheating on that right now.”Congress requires the president to certify the Iran deal every 90 days under law.“They are two different pieces,” Mattis said, referring to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act and the international agreement. “I’ve been dealing with the president and the secretary of state and it is being considered in terms of security for the U.S.—the law plus the agreement.”Fox News\' Lucas Tomlinson and the Associated Press contributed to this report.Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

The New York Times has been on a campaign to convince Americans the phrase has lost its original meaning.Here are examples from 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017.The same analysts reassure us that when senior Hamas leaders are quoted saying "not a single Jew will remain" in Israel, they are really communicating symbolically.As a historian, I am always amazed at the sophistry of well-educated establishments that hide from reality through the use of convoluted thinking and clever language.In my experience, dictators and revolutionary movements mean exactly what they say. In this case, the Iranians would like to destroy both America and Israel.Thankfully, President Trump understands this reality better than many so-called experts.The president did exactly the right thing Friday when he announced that he would renew sanctions on the Iranian regime and decline to certify the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (also known as the Iran Deal) negotiated by President Obama.President Trump has previously referred to the deal as “an embarrassment to the United States,” and called it “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.”Since he was a candidate, the President understood that America is today with the Iranian dictatorship where it was in 1994 with the North Korean dictatorship. We now know that during 23 years of talking, posturing, and diplomatic maneuvering, the North Koreans simply kept building their nuclear weapon and missile programs.As the president said Friday "History has shown that the longer we ignore a threat, the more dangerous that threat becomes."The president saw that we are today faced with the same choice with Iran that we had in North Korea in 1994. He decided to show the courage to tell the truth and act on it.This will be a big surprise to Iran – and North Korea. Having been conditioned by eight years of President Obama to assume that America will always posture and then cave, neither of these rogue nations knows how to deal with a super power that is serious.The weaknesses of the Obama agreement with Iran are simply symptoms of the weakness and self-delusion behind the entire Obama team approach to the Iranian dictatorship and its revolutionary terrorist strategies.Iran has proved that appeasement and negotiation fail time and again.Starting in 1979, when Ayatollah Khomeini established a religious dictatorship that exported terror and saw itself at war with America (\'the Great Satan") and Israel ("the Little Satan"), American policy became increasingly hostile to the regime.During the 1979-1981 Iranian hostage crisis, which was itself a total violation of international law, the Jimmy Carter Administration attempted a rational negotiating strategy. It was completely rejected by the mullahs.During the Reagan administration in 1983, truck bombs driven by Iranian-sponsored operatives killed 241 U.S. service personnel (220 marine and 21 other personnel) and 58 French paratroopers in Lebanon, and the United States quietly helped the Iraqis with intelligence and military equipment in their war with Iran.From 1987 to 1988 the United States provided naval support to help Kuwaiti tankers get through the straits of Hormuz. In that process, the Iranians tried to mine the Persian Gulf, and an American warship shot down an Iranian airliner it thought was on a dangerous course.Throughout the period of 1979 to 2008, the United States had a consistent policy of containing the Iranian dictatorship. It was clear that Iranians killed 19 Americans with a bomb at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. Iran was consistently labeled the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world by every administration (including Obama’s).President George W. Bush identified the Iranian dictatorship, along with Iraq and North Korea, as part of an "Axis of Evil." During our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan the Iranians worked hard to establish their own zones of influence.However, When President Obama came into office, nearly 30 years of hostility was replaced by a new vision of developing a relationship with the Iranian dictatorship. This is the delusional fantasy that has allowed Iran to dominate much of the Middle East, especially after Iraq was weakened by war. It also emboldened Iran.Even after President Trump’s historic and amazing United Nations speech when he condemned the JCPOA and said Iran is a "reckless regime – one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room," the Iranians responded by building more missiles.Consider this report by Reuters titled "Defying Trump, Iran says will boost missile capabilities”:“Iran will strengthen its missile capabilities and not seek any country’s permission, President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday rejecting demands from U.S. President Donald Trump.“Rouhani spoke at a military parade where an Iranian news agency said one of the weapons on display was a new ballistic missile with range of 1,200 miles, capable of carrying several warheads. …“In a speech broadcast on state television, Rouhani said: ‘We will increase our military power as a deterrent. We will strengthen our missile capabilities ... We will not seek permission from anyone to defend our country.’”For those who wonder how big the Iranian missile program is, AP reported that, “Brigadier General Hossein Salami of the Revolutionary Guard boasted that ‘the rate of our missile production is so high that we are faced with the problem of space’ to keep them in.”President Trump also realizes his administration must not consider the JCPOA in isolation.The failure of the JCPOA is simply one component of a disastrous Obama policy which has enabled Iran to break out and begin to develop a hegemonic position across Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon (with a dangerous extension to Gaza).For instance, Iranians have been desperate to build a land corridor to connect with Lebanon since the Reagan Administration was dueling with the Iranian-sponsored terrorists there. Obama\'s myopic policy of focusing only on the JCPOA gave Iran the opportunity it needed to gain that corridor.As a result, we are currently faced with preparations for war on a scale the Middle East has not seen since the Yom Kippur War in 1973.Hezbollah, the Iranian front group in South Lebanon, has more than 100,000 missiles that can be fired into Israel. As though that isn\'t enough of a threat, the Iranians plan to build missile factories in Syria and Lebanon. In addition, they are talking about developing an Iranian port in Lebanon.The weakness and confusion America has shown in Syria has created a Russian-Iranian-Assad-Hezbollah alliance that will push the threat to Israel to a totally new and dangerous level.Flush with money from Obama (including an airplane full of cash flown in like a drug cartel run), Iran has funded a proxy war in Yemen against the Saudis. More Iranian money has been sent to prop up Hamas after the various Sunni funders began to cut them off.On every front, Iran is a dangerous nation seeking to build up its capacity to wage war, project power, and intimidate its neighbors.Meanwhile, the JCPOA is another absurdity that illustrates how weak the Obama team was and how eager its members were to get an Iranian agreement to "something."Congress should move forward with initiatives to strengthen it.Under the current agreement, the Iranians have reserved the right to keep their military installations secret. Thus, international inspectors can look for violations anywhere except on military facilities. This means the inspections can have no validity, because inspectors will never know what they are not allowed to see.Finally, the United Nations agreement limiting Iranian missile development is being blatantly and publicly violated. That strikes at the very heart of the Corker-Cardin requirement that Iran must be fully implementing the related agreements. Iran\'s failed launch of a missile in January (which was based on North Korean designs) and its faked launch in September, are a blatant violations of the agreement.The terms of the Corker-Cardin “Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act” (INARA/ PL 114-17) require the president to certify Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA every 90 days.Full compliance under this law requires the United States to certify that: (1) Iran is fully implementing the JCPOA and all related agreements; (2) Iran has not committed (or if committed, has cured) a material breach; (3) Iran has taken no action to significantly advance its nuclear weapons program; and (4) that continued suspension of nuclear-related sanctions is both appropriate and vital to our national security interests.It is impossible to argue that criterion four has been met when Iran\'s behavior in its totality is taken into account. This is exactly the logic the president followed on Friday.How can you take President Trump\'s strong, clear denunciation of the dictatorship and argue that continued suspension of sanctions on Iran is both appropriate and vital to our national interest? It’s impossible.Unlike President Obama, whose posture was all talk and no action, President Trump has begun to establish a pattern of taking real actions, creating real pressures, and insisting on real results.President Trump’s decision to decertify is a clear and forceful articulation of the comprehensive Trump policy toward Iran.However, he didn’t come to this decision alone. The President spent months working with his Cabinet to make this decision. Confronting the totality of the Iranian threat, while remaining in the JCPOA with an eye toward improving it, substantially reflects the influence of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. In helping shape a new Iran policy that better provides for America’s security interests, Tillerson has proved to be an able advisor to the president, and has de-bunked media myths about a Trump-Tillerson rift in the process.The administration should continue to oppose Iran\'s aggression in the region and seek to eliminate the fundamental flaws of the nuclear deal (starting with the sunset clauses).As United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley made clear in her recent speech at the American Enterprise Institute, certification and the US continuation of the JCPOA are two separate decisions. Decertification leaves the President with continued flexibility and a number of options. In fact, decertification will increase the Administration\'s leverage to fix the nuclear deal by clarifying that the US will not be satisfied to remain indefinitely in an agreement that is not in our national security interests.Conversely, signing recertification would have undermined every strong signal we have sent about the Iranian dictatorship. They would interpret it as America flinching and pulling back. It would have made the President’s powerful indictment of Iran and North Korea at the United Nations seem hollow.President Trump’s decisive refusal to recertify the JCPOA has drawn a line and communicated clearly that the rollback of Iranian influence has begun. It was a brave and historically necessary step.Newt Gingrich is a Fox News contributor. A Republican, he was speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 1999. Follow him on Twitter @NewtGingrich. His latest book is "Understanding Trump."', '', '', 'WASHINGTON – When President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that Iran had "just test-fired" a missile, he seemed to know something the rest of the government did not. Turns out, he did not.There was no Iranian ballistic missile launch, three U.S. officials said Tuesday.Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard had used a military parade on Friday to display its Khoramshahr medium-range ballistic missile, which is capable of reaching Israel and much of the Middle East. That same day, video of the test firing of a Khoramshahr aired on Iranian state TV. The time or location of the test was not mentioned in the report, and it appears that the video footage was from a failed Iranian missile test earlier this year.It\'s unclear where Trump got his information, but it apparently did not come from U.S. intelligence agencies, which keep a continuous lookout for missile launches around the globe. As president, Trump could easily have checked with the CIA or other intelligence agencies to verify whether Iran had actually test-fired a missile.In his tweet he renewed his criticism of the nuclear agreement reached with Iran during the Obama administration."Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel," he wrote. "They are also working with North Korea. Not much of an agreement we have!"The nuclear agreement is designed to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb but does not prohibit it from developing missiles.Among the three officials who said there was no Iranian missile launch last week, one said officials who work on Iran issues were caught off guard by Trump\'s tweet. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an intelligence issue.Trump has suggested he might seek to renegotiate the nuclear deal or abandon it. He told the U.N. General Assembly last week that the accord was "nothing short of an embarrassment" and the "worst one-sided deal perhaps in American history."Officials have said Trump might use the Oct. 15 deadline for certifying to Congress whether Iran is in compliance with the nuclear deal to either declare Iran in violation or determine that the agreement is no longer in the national security interest of the U.S.Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday that Iran is adhering to its obligations under the nuclear agreement, known officially as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. He stressed that his concern is about Iran\'s behavior in other areas, such as its development of ballistic missiles and its support for extremist groups.Dunford declined to say publicly what advice he has given Trump on whether to recertify Iran\'s compliance with the nuclear deal.', 'European Diplomats Speak Out Against Trump’s Opposition to Iran Deal - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — After months of quietly urging the Trump administration to preserve the Iran nuclear deal, European diplomats have begun an aggressive defense of it, warning of serious consequences if the United States ignores their concerns.President Trump denounced the nuclear agreement in a speech to the United Nations last week as an “embarrassment to the United States.” But he said later that his real goal is not to scrap the deal right away but to enlist the European allies who were also signatories of the 2015 agreement in an effort toughen its provisions.Responding to his speech, Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said there was “no need to reopen the agreement because it’s fully delivering.” And she expressed the near-disbelief among European officials that Mr. Trump might walk away from the Iran accord while trying to resolve an escalating crisis involving North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.“We already have one potential nuclear crisis,” she said. “We definitely do not need to go into a second one.”Preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons could be impossible should Mr. Trump decide to abandon the landmark deal struck by President Barack Obama and the leaders of Germany, France, Britain, China, Russia and Iran. And Europe is far closer to Iran and at much greater risk than the United States should it develop nuclear weapons.On Monday, the ambassadors to the United States from Britain, France, Germany and the European Union met on a stage at the Atlantic Council in Washington to reinforce that message.Gérard Araud, the French ambassador, said that it was not just the Europeans who refused to renegotiate but also Iran as well as China and Russia. Their position, he said, was, “‘No way. There won’t be any reopening of the agreement. The agreement is working as it is.’”Should the United States end the agreement and attempt to penalize European companies doing business with Iran, David O’Sullivan, the European Union’s ambassador, said that Europe could respond with its own measures against the United States.“I’ve no doubt that if this scenario materializes, the European Union will act to protect the legitimate interests of our companies,” he said.For most of this year, Mr. Trump and America’s European allies have papered over stark differences on such issues as the Paris climate accord to preserve some semblance of Western unity.But European officials say their patience with Mr. Trump may be nearing an end, and they view his possible abandonment of the Iran nuclear agreement as a potential breaking point.“These problems are on our doorstep,” Kim Darroch, the British ambassador, said on Monday, adding: “These issues matter to us and to our national security more than you could imagine.”Until recently, senior Trump administration officials had reassured their European counterparts that while a comprehensive review of Iran policy was underway, none thought that scrapping the nuclear deal would be a good idea, according to European officials and diplomats.But in recent weeks, they have been told that Mr. Trump had told advisers that he will likely refuse next month to certify to Congress that Iran is in compliance with the deal. In a meeting last week with British Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr. Trump said he had made a decision on the deal but refused to disclose what he had settled on.In a speech three weeks ago at a conservative think tank, Nikki Haley, the Trump administration’s ambassador to the United Nations, described in detail how and why such a decertification could occur. And she said that European concerns about such a strategy would not deter Mr. Trump.Decertifying the deal would give Congress 60 days under accelerated legislative provisions to vote to reimpose sanctions on Iran and any country doing business there.Such a process would force Europe to accede to the Trump administration’s demands for fear that “powerful U.S. secondary sanctions and other instruments of financial power would force European banks and companies to choose between America’s $19 trillion-dollar market and Iran’s $400 billion one,” said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a prominent critic of the Iran deal.Critics of the nuclear deal want stronger limits on Iran’s ballistic missile program, an end to its support of proxy forces like Hezbollah and an extension of limits on Iran’s nuclear capabilities beyond the timeline set out in the accord.But European diplomats said they have been suggesting for months ways to accomplish all of those goals and have been stymied by the Trump administration’s internal discord and ongoing Iran review.“We are coming all the time to this administration with ideas and policies,” Mr. Darroch said.Peter Wittig, the German ambassador, pointed out that when sanctions were first imposed on Iran over its nuclear ambitions, few American companies suffered because there was little trade between the United States and Iran.“German companies have suffered billions and billions and billions of dollars,” Mr. Wittig said.Now, he said, trade with Iran could help moderate the country.“We want Iran to gradually move to our values, to our worldview, and trade is an instrument,” he said.', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Trump’s Iran Derangement - The New York TimesBERLIN — If President Trump decertifies the Iran nuclear deal this week, as seems likely, “it will show total disrespect for America’s allies,” Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German ambassador to the United States, told me. That’s the least of it. This — and I know competition is stiff — would be the rashest, most foolish act of the Trump administration to date.The president’s refusal to certify an accord his own defense secretary, James Mattis, says Iran is upholding, and is in the American national interest, would send a strong signal that the United States has become a bait-and-switch power whose word is worthless.It’s America’s word as solemn gage that has underwritten global security since 1945. Goodbye to all that.Uncorked, Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has grown bubbly. He’s compared Trump’s White House to “an adult day care center” in which only the likes of Mattis are keeping the child-sovereign’s tantrums from causing disaster. He’s suggested that, through infantile recklessness, Trump could set us “on the path to World War III.”Exhibit A in this pattern of puerility would be the decertification of a multilateral deal that is working and is supported by China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, powers with which Trump may even have a passing acquaintance.Bait and switch, I said. The accord is a nuclear nonproliferation deal, not a grand bargain with Iran. It was concluded, as most breakthrough diplomatic accords are, with a hostile power. It was designed to curb the potential threat from the Islamic Republic, not change the nature of the regime overnight. It was about centrifuges, not Iranian support for Hezbollah; enriched uranium, not Iran’s terrible human rights record. It represents a difficult compromise between two countries — the United States and Iran — whose accumulated grievances stretch back decades but whose unyielding confrontation benefits neither.Iran’s nuclear program was pitched into reverse by the agreement after a decade of rapid development. The number of centrifuges was slashed. Iran’s uranium stockpile was all but eliminated; enrichment levels are capped at 3.7 percent, a long way from bomb grade; outside inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency is rigorous. The IAEA, like Mattis, has found that Iran is in compliance.Would it have been nice if Iran had been persuaded to dismantle its nuclear program and its scientists induced to consign their mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle to amnesiac oblivion? Sure. Dream on. Diplomacy takes place in the real world, as those mouthing off about North Korean nuclear dismantlement will discover. It involves trade-offs equally painful for both sides that produce an imperfect outcome better than the alternative.(If anyone needs reminding of the alternative, North Korea has nukes. Iran does not — and is now further from one than it was. One of the extraordinary aspects of Trump’s caprice is his apparent willingness to open a second nuclear front, like some loony generalissimo who wakes up feeling an Asian conflagration is insufficient, a Middle Eastern one is needed, too.)Thanks to Dexter Filkins at The New Yorker we have a verbatim account of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s first encounter last month with the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Tillerson is an ineffective secretary of state whose major contribution to truth-telling has been to call his boss, Trump, a moron. Still, as long as he’s around, he’s beholden to the Trump line on Iran, whatever his own reservations.So Tillerson tells Zarif: “No one can credibly claim that Iran has positively contributed to regional peace and security.” This is true, but irrelevant to the nuclear deal. He tells Zarif that lifting sanctions under the accord “has enabled Iran’s unacceptable behavior.” This is untrue and so by definition irrelevant. He says of Iran and the United States, “the relationship has been defined by violence — against us.” The violence has gone both ways, and this is irrelevant.Bait and switch: Imagine if Iran said it planned to rip up the nuclear agreement because the United States elected a Saudi-loving, Iran-hating president in Trump; and his dancing with the Saudi royals, combined with his Qatar derangement syndrome, had not “contributed to regional peace and security.”Filkins writes of the encounter: “An aide to Tillerson later told me, ‘It was one of the finest moments in American diplomacy in the last fifty years.’ ”I am paid to produce words. I regret that this sentence renders me speechless.Of course, a Trump refusal to certify may not unravel the deal, but it would put it on life-support, as well as doing lasting damage to American credibility.The Republican-controlled Congress may not reimpose sanctions — a step that would kill the accord — or take other legislative action to scuttle it, but Trump will already have done enough damage to make any nation question why it should conclude a deal with the United States. Only Trump could contrive to cede the moral high ground to Iran.Trump will also have made the Middle East more dangerous, reinforced Iranian hard-liners, angered allies and done a disservice to Israeli security. He is in a class of his own.', 'European Leaders Criticize Trump’s Disavowal of Iran Deal - The New York TimesLONDON — Iran, Russia and European leaders roundly condemned President Trump’s decision on Friday to disavow the Iran nuclear deal, saying that it reflected the growing isolation of the United States, threatened to destabilize the Middle East and could make it harder to resolve the growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.The reaction was far from panicked, as Mr. Trump’s decision punts to Congress the critical decision of whether the United States will reimpose sanctions on Iran — a step that would effectively sink the deal.But Mr. Trump also warned that unless the nuclear agreement was altered and made permanent — to prohibit Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons — he would terminate the agreement, an ultimatum that threw the future of the accord into question.Though they avoided direct criticism of Mr. Trump, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a rare joint statement that they “stand committed” to the 2015 nuclear deal and that preserving it was “in our shared national security interest.”“The nuclear deal was the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran’s nuclear program is not diverted for military purposes,” they added.Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s foreign minister, said that Mr. Trump was sending “a difficult and also from our point of view dangerous signal.”He said that the Iran deal, and other diplomatic achievements, were necessary “to convince countries like North Korea, and maybe also others, that it is possible to create security without acquiring nuclear weapons.”“Destroying this agreement would, worldwide, mean that others could no longer rely on such agreements — that’s why it is a danger that goes further than Iran,” he added.Reaction from Iran was quick and pointed. Appearing on television, its president, Hassan Rouhani, denounced Mr. Trump and called the United States an outlier that had become “more lonely than ever” in the international community. Mr. Rouhani did not threaten to withdraw from the deal, but made it clear that he would not renegotiate the terms, either.“The statements of Mr. Trump are nothing but abuse and threats against the people of Iran,” he said. “An international agreement cannot be disregarded.”The European leaders noted that the United Nations Security Council had unanimously endorsed the deal, and that the International Atomic Energy Agency had confirmed Iran’s compliance with it.But Mr. Trump’s aggressive stance on Iran won plaudits from several nations on Friday, specifically from adversaries of Iran like Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister who has always opposed the agreement with Iran, said that Mr. Trump’s announcement created “an opportunity to fix this bad deal” and was a sign of Mr. Trump’s determination to “boldly confront Iran’s terrorist regime.”Saudi Arabia, which has waged a proxy battle against Iran for supremacy in the region and was the first country Mr. Trump visited after taking office, said it welcomed what it called a “new U.S. strategy” toward Iran.The United Arab Emirates, which like Saudi Arabia is a predominantly Sunni Muslim country with a sizable Shiite minority, also said that it “fully supports” Mr. Trump’s stance on Iran.Some leaders declared that the deal, reached in 2015 between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, was not something that Mr. Trump could cancel, contending that Mr. Trump was essentially putting on a show for his political base.“The president of the United States has many powers — not this one,” the European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, said at a news conference in Brussels.She said that there had been no violations of the agreement and that the world could not afford to dismantle an accord that “is working and delivering,” especially at a time of “acute nuclear threat,” referring to the standoff with North Korea over its nuclear program.Criticism of the nuclear deal was a central theme of Mr. Trump’s candidacy for president, and he has repeatedly called for revisiting what he sees as a fatally flawed agreement.Mr. Trump said on Friday that under the current deal “Iran can sprint” toward the development of nuclear weapons when the deal’s restrictions expire.Some of the prohibitions in the agreement are set to end in 2025, including limits on the number of its centrifuges. Iran, which has always maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, not for weapons, would not agree to a permanent freeze in its ability to enrich nuclear fuel.That must be changed, Mr. Trump said, or he would scrap the deal altogether.Russia, which took part in the negotiations to reach the accord and has warned Mr. Trump not to rescind it, said that the president had no basis for disavowing the deal.“Iran is abiding” by the nuclear agreement, Mikhail Ulyanov, a director at the Russian foreign ministry, told the Interfax news agency. “Everyone agrees with that. And an attempt to somehow heighten the tensions in this situation looks like unmotivated aggression.”In blunt language, Ms. Mogherini, the European Union’s top diplomat, essentially looked past Mr. Trump and appealed to Congress directly.America’s next step “is now in the hands of the United States Congress,” she said. “The international community and the European Union with it has clearly indicated that the deal is and will continue to be in place.”Russia urged American lawmakers to preserve the deal as well.“We want to hope that Congress will not take any dramatic steps which would effectively signify a collapse” of the deal, Russia’s deputy foreign minister told Interfax, referring to the renewed sanctions that might lead Iran to nullify the accord.In his remarks, Mr. Trump accused Iran of violating both the letter and the spirit of the accord. But Iran has accused the United States of doing the same, and on Friday its mission to the United Nations warned that Iran might itself back away from the deal.“Iran has many options on how to proceed and if necessary will terminate its commitment regarding this issue,” the mission said in a statement, without elaborating.Iran has also resisted the idea of renegotiating the nuclear agreement in the West’s favor. Last month, its foreign minister rejected extending the length or conditions of the accord, saying that Iran would consider changing the agreement only if the concessions it had already made — including giving up nuclear fuel — were reconsidered.There are fears that the basic framework of the accord could collapse if the United States walks away. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters on Friday that Russia believed Iran would abandon the deal if the United States did.', '', '', '', 'Tillerson Warns Europe Against Iran Investments - The New York TimesRIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson warned Europeans on Sunday not to invest in certain Iranian businesses as the Trump administration considers walking away from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions against Iran.Speaking during a visit to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Tillerson said, “Both of our countries believe that those who conduct business with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, any of their entities — European companies or other companies around the globe — really do so at great risk.” Mr. Tillerson appeared at a brief news conference in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, with the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir.The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps maintains monopoly control over large sectors of Iran’s economy.Mr. Tillerson’s remarks were the administration’s most pointed warning to date as the Trump administration tries to persuade its European allies to support an effort to reopen the nuclear accord to make it tougher.European leaders and diplomats from Germany, Britain, France and the European Union have repeatedly insisted that the nuclear deal is working, that Iran is complying with the accord and that no renegotiation is possible. Russia and China, which also signed the agreement, have evinced no interest in a renegotiation. And Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has warned that Iran would insist on new concessions, such as a return of its nuclear fuel, in any new agreement.The quiet struggle between the Trump administration and its most important European allies has been the focus of much of the jockeying after President Trump decided this month not to certify that Iran was complying with all the terms of the agreement. That kicked to Congress the decision about whether to reimpose sanctions and abandon the accord.Allies of the administration have argued that should Congress decide to reimpose sanctions on Iran, European companies would have little choice but to comply since they would not want to risk being shut out of the $19 trillion American market in favor of Iran’s $400 billion one.With the Europeans on board, Iran would feel the sting of significant sanctions even if Russia and China did not join in. Without the Europeans, however, Iran would feel few effects from sanctions by the United States — the two countries have little trade — while potentially being able to pursue nuclear weapons with the nuclear accord ended.European diplomats have said they would defend their companies against such sanctions, potentially setting up an epic battle between close allies and two of the largest commercial markets on the planet.Mr. Tillerson’s warning, which came as he stood beside the top diplomat of Saudi Arabia — a fierce foe of Iran — raised the rhetorical stakes in the looming battle.“And we are hoping,” the secretary said, “that European companies, countries, and others around the world will join the U.S. as we put in place a sanctions structure to prohibit certain activities of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard that foment instability in the region and create destruction in the region, both in terms of their involvement in Yemen but their involvement in Syria as well.”Mr. Tillerson was in Saudi Arabia in part to encourage a nascent reconciliation between the Saudis and Iraqis as the military struggle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria nears an end with the recent recapture of Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria.Over the weekend, Saudi companies participated for the first time in 27 years in an international business fair held in Baghdad. Regular commercial direct flights between Riyadh and Baghdad began this year for the first time in many years.Iraq’s prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, attended an inaugural Saudi Arabia-Iraq Coordination Council Meeting. Presided over by King Salman, the meeting was seen as an important effort to help Iraq as it tries to recover from the catastrophic damage wrought during the war. The United States has long been pushing Saudi Arabia and other Sunni countries to embrace Iraq even as Iran’s influence in the country has grown.Mr. Tillerson said bluntly that Iranian-backed militias and groups that had helped in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, needed to disband, join the Iraqi Army or leave the country. “Iranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fight against Daesh and ISIS is coming to a close, those militias need to go home,” he said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.The Americans have warned Saudi Arabia and other Sunni states that unless they invest in Iraq, Iranian influence in the battered country will only grow.“I think as Iraq looks towards the future,” Mr. Tillerson said, “we know that they want a secure, stable economy. They want the capacity to meet the needs of all their citizens. And in particular, they want to develop the governmental capacities to resist any outside influence.”Mr. Tillerson was also in the region to seek a resolution to a bitter standoff between Qatar and four Arab nations that has threatened a host of American military and diplomatic priorities. But he made little progress.“There’s not a strong indication that the parties are ready to talk yet,” Mr. Tillerson said at a separate news conference in Doha, Qatar’s capital. “So we cannot force talks on parties that are not ready to talk.”', '', '', 'Why Trump Hates the Iran Nuclear Deal - Video - NYTimes.com', 'Zarrab’s Take From Iran Sanctions Plot? ‘Maybe $150 Million,’ He Says - The New York TimesReza Zarrab, the government’s star witness in a trial involving a billion-dollar conspiracy to smuggle gold for oil in violation of United States sanctions on Iran, testified on Tuesday that he had made huge sums of money in the scheme — but he could not recall the precise amount.“I don’t remember exactly but it could be $100 million,” Mr. Zarrab, who helped orchestrate the scheme, told the jury through an interpreter. “Maybe more than that. Maybe $150 million.”Mr. Zarrab’s testimony came on his fifth day on the witness stand in Federal District Court in Manhattan as he was cross-examined by a lawyer for a Turkish banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who is on trial for his alleged involvement in the sanctions evasion.Mr. Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian citizen who was arrested on a 2016 family trip to Disney World, testified last week that in 2012, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then Turkey’s prime minister and now its president, personally ordered that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in the scheme.Mr. Zarrab also testified that he had paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to the country’s then economy minister, Zafer Caglayan.Before Mr. Zarrab secretly pleaded guilty on Oct. 26 to conspiring in the sanctions scheme, he was to have been tried along with Mr. Atilla. His plea and cooperation agreement were revealed last week when the trial began.On Tuesday, during his cross-examination, Mr. Zarrab offered new details about an unrelated charge to which he also pleaded guilty — bribing a guard at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was held, in return for contraband like alcohol and for the use of the guard’s cellphone.Mr. Zarrab revealed Tuesday that the bribe was about $45,000, and said the payment had been arranged by a lawyer in Turkey who was representing him and was in New York at the time. Mr. Zarrab did not identify the lawyer; one of his New York attorneys, Robert J. Anello, declined to comment. A jail spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mr. Zarrab’s testimony, now in its second week, continued to send political tremors through Turkey.Mr. Erdogan used his weekly address to parliamentarians from his Justice and Development Party on Tuesday to make a heated attack against the United States. He pointed to not just the trial, but also American support for Kurdish insurgents in Syria and United States policy in Israel.“It is now understood that the U.S.A. has a plan against us,” Mr. Erdogan told legislators. “It is obvious that this trial is brought up as a tool to blackmail us to give up our claims in the region.”Mr. Erdogan, who values his personal relationship with President Trump, suggested that holdovers from the Obama administration still in the United States government were trying to undermine the Trump administration.“This trial is also a piece of the big fight, the big strife in American domestic politics,” Mr. Erdogan said. “American media covers this trial alongside with the ‘Russia, Flynn, Trump’ headline.”Mr. Erdogan noted that the sanctions case indictment says “conspiracy.”“Yes, there is conspiracy — but against Turkey,” he said. As he has repeatedly in the past, he blamed followers of the cleric Fethullah Gulen, who he has accused of fomenting a failed coup against him in 2016.And in a warning to opponents at home, Mr. Erdogan said: “Whoever takes the trial in America as a matter of domestic politics is a collaborator in the treachery.”During Mr. Zarrab’s cross-examination, he also revealed that his lawyers first met with prosecutors as early as the summer of 2016 to discuss the possibility of his cooperating with the government, but the idea went nowhere. Then, this past August, he and his lawyers met with the government, leading to about a dozen sessions with prosecutors and F.B.I. agents, after which the government agreed to the cooperation deal.Mr. Zarrab also testified about his efforts before becoming a government witness to have his lawyers in Turkey and New York try to resolve his case outside of the court system. “Within the bounds of law, they did make efforts,” he said in response to a question from Cathy Fleming, a lawyer for Mr. Atilla.“In fact, you hired Rudy Giuliani and former Attorney General Michael Mukasey as your attorneys in the United States to try to work out a solution for you in Turkey, correct?” Ms. Fleming asked.“That is correct, ma’am,” Mr. Zarrab said.“In fact, you are furious with people in Turkey that it did not work, isn’t that true?” Ms. Fleming asked.“I don’t have any anger towards anybody, ma’am,” Mr. Zarrab replied.', 'LONDON – British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson plans to go to Iran in an effort to win the release of a British-Iranian national imprisoned on charges of trying to overthrow the government.The Foreign Office said in a statement that Johnson would meet with Iran\'s foreign minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, on Saturday to discuss "a number of consular cases involving dual nationals," along with other bilateral issues.Johnson is under pressure to win the freedom of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a 38-year-old charity worker imprisoned in April 2016 after she was accused of plotting against Iran\'s government.Johnson complicated matters when he incorrectly stated last month that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was training journalists when she was arrested.

Residents were retiring for the night at the time. Iran\'s western Kermanshah province, a rural mountainous region, bore the brunt of the temblor, with Iran\'s state-run news agency reporting the quake killed407 people in the country and injured another 6,700.In Iraq, the earthquake killed at least seven people and injured 535 there, all in the country\'s northern, semiautonomous Kurdish region, according to Iraq\'s Interior Ministry. Iraqi seismologist Abdul-Karim Abdullah Taqi, who runs the earthquake monitoring group at the state-run Meteorological Department, said the main reason for the lower casualty figure in Iraq was the angle and the direction of the fault line in this particular quake, as well as the nature of the Iraqi geological formations that could better absorb the shocks.Video captures bar patrons fleeing in Sulaymaniyah, Iraq, when a 7.3-magnitude #earthquake struck the city.

It struck at a depth of 14.4 miles, a shallow depth that can cause broad damage. Magnitude 7 earthquakes on their own are capable of widespread, heavy damage. Iranian social media and news agencies showed images and videos of people fleeing their homes. Kokab Fard, a 49-year-old housewife in Sarpol-e-Zahab, said she could only flee empty-handed when her apartment complex collapsed."Immediately after I managed to get out, the building collapsed," Fard said. "I have no access to my belongings."Reza Mohammadi, 51, said he and his family ran out into the alley following the first shock he felt."I tried to get back to pick some stuff but it totally collapsed in the second wave," Mohammadi said.The semi-official ILNA news agency said at least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected by the earthquake.

(AP)Iran sits on many major fault lines and is prone to near-daily quakes. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. The last major casualty earthquake in Iran struck in East Azerbaijan province in August 2012, killing over 300 people.The Iraqi city of Halabja, closest to the epicenter, is notorious for the 1988 chemical attack in which Saddam Hussein\'s regime killed some 5,000 people with mustard gas -- the deadliest chemical weapons attack ever against civilians.The Associated Press contributed to this story.', 'Iranians Are Outraged Over Shoddy Construction in Earthquake Zone - The New York TimesESLAMABAD, Iran — The opening of the new wing of the Imam Khomeini hospital last year was a big deal in this provincial Iranian town. The health minister cut a red ribbon, and V.I.P. guests smiled as state television recorded the entire event.More than 100 beds were added in a $15 million construction project that had taken more than eight years to complete and had made the hospital the largest in the region. “We were so proud,” said Reza Naderi, one of the managers.But during the 30-second earthquake on Sunday, the new wing partly crumpled like an empty soft-drink can in the hands of a child. The original hospital building, 40 years old, stood beside the wreckage, barely damaged.The magnitude 7.3 earthquake killed more than 500 people in Iran and eight in neighboring Iraq. More than 40,000 properties became uninhabitable, officials say, including many newly built state hospitals, schools, apartment complexes and even army barracks. It is unclear how many people died in collapsed government buildings.The earthquake has laid bare what many Iranians have been saying for a long time: Corruption inside state organizations has led to shoddy construction work and undermined Iran’s infrastructure.Building permits can be bought, developers are allowed to economize on safety regulations and some quality-control inspectors make more of their living from bribes than salaries, insiders say.One outcome has been a sharp increase in industrial accidents in recent years. Dozens of gas transportation pipes have exploded and several refineries have caught fire.This year, a poorly maintained high-rise building in the center of Tehran burned and collapsed, leaving 20 firefighters dead. Home to dozens of textile shops and storage spaces, the building did not have a sprinkler system. A government report concluded that the religious foundation that owned the building had not done proper upkeep and that government agencies had failed to enforce 22 national building regulations. No one was punished.President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday visited Sarpol-e Zahab, one of the cities hit worst by the earthquake. In front of rows of partly collapsed apartment buildings for the poor, built under his predecessor and political rival, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mr. Rouhani called for an investigation into the quality of government construction projects.Standing through the sunroof of his car, surrounded by angry local residents, Mr. Rouhani also talked about the Imam Khomeini hospital, where the old and the new had stood side by side before the tremor struck.“Look, there are two buildings: One of the buildings, which was constructed by government contractors, and you can see the other building built by people, by individuals, and they still stand,” he said. “We should find the culprits and people are waiting for us to introduce the culprits. We will do that, we will do that.”Housing and other projects for the disadvantaged have been built nationwide and represent just a fraction of construction involving the state. Outside Tehran, in the city of Boomehen, around 40 high rises have been erected on the flanks of a mountain, vexed by all sorts of construction issues. Analysts say the root problem is widespread corruption.“State institutions tasked with fighting corruption are themselves corrupted,” said Saeed Laylaz, an economist who supports Mr. Rouhani’s government. “There is no short-term remedy.”He also pointed out how the government had systematically not paid contractors for their jobs, instead giving them i.o.u.’s that quickly lost half their worth. “Naturally next time they get a job they try to cheat wherever they can,” Mr. Laylaz said.Twenty-three people died on Sunday in Eslamabad, a tree-lined town on the road to the border with Iraq, but perhaps by miracle none of the victims had been inside the ruined wing of the hospital. Elevators stuck, ceilings collapsed, floors jumped like springboards. The 126 patients, some in intensive care, howled and screamed, said Mohammad Fardin Ghanbari, a hospital clerk. “It was hell.”The hospital’s director, Ahmadreza Biglari, was home when his ceiling swayed and his cupboards started dancing. When the earthquake ended he called the hospital and learned the disastrous news: “The new wing was severely damaged.”There was nothing the staff could do but to evacuate bedridden patients. “Just as we were done, hundreds of wounded from nearby towns affected by the quake arrived,” he said.Mr. Biglari stood outside the five floors of the new wing, now partly crumpled and riddled with cracks and holes. Construction workers were cleaning up what was left of the fragmented tile facade. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps had set up a huge field hospital on the grounds. Mr. Biglari was upset.“The experts came yesterday and did an assessment,” he said, pointing at the wreckage. “If the old building hadn’t stood next to it, supporting the structure, the new wing would have collapsed. It needs to be demolished.”Some hospital employees said the engineer responsible for the construction had been arrested, but Mr. Biglari did not want to confirm that. “There will be a court case for sure,” he said.The building had been constructed by a unit of the Housing Ministry, said Mr. Ghanbari, the clerk. He shook his head.“It’s unimaginable,” he said. “There is a massive earthquake, and this the one place that should be safe. How can they let this happen?”In signs of growing criticism against not only the shoddy building but also the speed of aid efforts, a local member of Parliament spoke out in an angry interview with the semiofficial news agency ILNA.The parliament member, Ahmad Safari, from Kermanshah Province in western Iran, said he believed the number of dead may be roughly double the the official toll.“In my opinion, more than 1,000 people lost their lives,” Mr. Safari was quoted by ILNA as saying. “Seventy people were killed only in one street in Sarpol-e Zahab. More than 250 people were killed in the Mehr apartments,” he said, referring to badly built housing complexes for the poor.Mr. Safari also criticized what he called the lack of relief supplies for the victims. “Unfortunately, aid has not yet been distributed to all villages, perhaps only 10 percent of the villages have tents,” he was quoted as saying.', 'TEHRAN, Iran – A 7.2-magnitude earthquake jolted the region between Iran and Iraq on Sunday, killing at least two people and injuring 28 others.The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed the quake on its website, placing its epicenter around 19 miles (31 kilometers) outside the eastern Iraqi city of Halabja and issuing an "orange" alert for "shaking-related fatalities and economic losses."Faramarz Akbari, a local official in the Iranian border city of Ghasr-e Shirin, reported the death toll to Iran\'s state-run IRNA news agency.Pirhossein Koulivand, head of Iran\'s emergency medical services, told a local television station that the earthquake led to a power outage in the country\'s western cities of Mehran and Ilam.He also said 35 rescue teams were providing assistance.Iranian social media was abuzz Sunday night with posts of people evacuating their homes, particularly in Kermanshah and Ghasr-e Shirin, where injured people were thought to be buried under the rubble.The semi-official Iranian ILNA news agency reported that at least 14 provinces had been impacted by the earthquake.Iran sits on many major fault lines and is prone to near-daily quakes. In 2003, a 6.6 magnitude flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people.', '‘From One Crisis to the Next’: Brexit-Torn Britain Stumbles - The New York TimesLONDON — Britain’s embattled prime minister, Theresa May, got a break of sorts Tuesday from the sprawling sex and sleaze scandal that has already forced the resignation of a cabinet minister — but only because her weakened government was embroiled in two new crises.On vacation in Israel, the international development secretary, Priti Patel, held 12 secret meetings, one with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and discussed sending aid money to the Israeli authorities. Back at home, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, made an incorrect statement that could mean more prison time for a Briton imprisoned in Iran.In normal times, either scandal might prompt their resignations, as opposition politicians have demanded.But these are not normal times in Britain, which is negotiating its fast-looming exit from the European Union, or Brexit, a bitterly divisive issue that often appears to have paralyzed the government.Within Mrs. May’s Conservative Party, the internal politics of Brexit overshadow everything, including appointments to a cabinet constructed carefully to balance supporters and opponents of the withdrawal, which was approved narrowly last year in a bitterly contested referendum.Hence, a ragged government is “moving from one crisis to the next crisis,” in the words of Nicholas Crowson, professor of contemporary British history at the University of Birmingham. With Brexit now the key dividing line in British politics, he said, management of a cabinet has become “close to impossible.”Having already lost her defense secretary, Michael Fallon, and with two other ministers under threat in the sleaze allegations, Mrs. May has declared Ms. Patel’s case closed. And on Tuesday, Mr. Johnson brushed aside calls for his resignation.Ms. Patel held the meetings in Israel without telling the Foreign Office, a clear breach of protocol. The appointments were set up with the help of Stuart Polak, the honorary president of the Conservative Friends of Israel, a lobbying organization.Ms. Patel also asked officials from her department to examine whether public money could support humanitarian operations by the Israeli Defense Forces in parts of the Golan Heights. As she ought to have predicted, the answer was no, because Britain regards the Golan Heights as occupied territory.In addition, Ms. Patel was forced to issue an embarrassing clarification, walking back the false impression she gave The Guardian that Mr. Johnson was aware of her meetings in advance.The foreign secretary has problems of his own over comments he made when speaking to a parliamentary committee late last month about a British citizen of Iranian descent, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is imprisoned in Iran. Mr. Johnson described her conviction for sedition as a mockery of justice but also said she had been “simply teaching people journalism.”Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year prison term on charges of seeking to overthrow the government, claims her supporters have called absurd. Days after Mr. Johnson’s comments, she was taken to a new court hearing, where the minister’s statement was cited as evidence that she had been engaged in “propaganda against the regime,” a serious offense.On Tuesday Mr. Johnson said that in a phone conversation with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, he had expressed concern that his words had been used against Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, but was told that was not the case.“I accept that my remarks could have been clearer,” Mr. Johnson said. But he declined to apologize and he called on critics to direct their ire at Iran instead.That failed to satisfy opposition lawmakers, including Ben Bradshaw, who said that if Britain “had a prime minister who wasn’t so weak,” both of the cabinet ministers “would have been sacked.”The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, told lawmakers that she hoped that “no lasting damage has been done to Nazarin as a result of his blunder.”Mr. Johnson was always a controversial choice of foreign secretary, having before his appointment suggested that President Barack Obama had an “ancestral dislike of the British Empire,” written a poem insinuating that Turkey’s president had sexual relations with a goat and likened the European Union to the Third Reich.Ms. Patel’s appointment raised eyebrows, too, because she told The Daily Telegraph in 2013 that the department she now runs should be scrapped and replaced with a trade-focused body to help businesses invest in the developing world.Yet, Mr. Johnson and Ms. Patel were leading campaigners for Brexit in the referendum, and Mrs. May therefore found them cabinet jobs — a big one in the case of Mr. Johnson, one of the public faces of the campaign to leave the European Union.The resignation from the defense post by Mr. Fallon, a “remain” supporter in the referendum, seems to have been prompted in part by complaints from a Brexit-enthusiast, Andrea Leadsom, who is the leader of the House of Commons.When Mr. Fallon stood down last week, the internal balance of the cabinet meant that he had to be replaced by someone who — like him — was loyal to Mrs. May and who had campaigned for remain during the referendum. Mrs. May opted to promote the chief whip, Gavin Williamson, a decision that provoked fierce complaints that such a senior position had gone to someone with no experience of a big government department or knowledge of the military.Perhaps the only consolation for Mrs. May is that, at a time when her leadership is under continual threat, several potential successors are — for now at least — out of the picture. Mr. Fallon had been talked of a potential caretaker leader, while Mr. Johnson’s latest misstep error has focused attention on his competence.On Tuesday one lawmaker, Anna Soubry, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Johnson’s “lack of contrition is as shameful as the original error” over Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe. She said, “Boris Johnson doesn’t understand magnitude of the job & responsibility he holds.”And Ms. Soubry is a fellow Conservative.', 'Iraq Is Not Iran’s Puppet - The New York TimesBEIRUT, Lebanon — Iraq is, once again, deeply embroiled in crisis. For three years, the central government in Baghdad and the Kurdish region fought together to oust the Islamic State. Now, following the Sept. 25 referendum on independence for the region, they are pointing their guns at each other.The dynamics in Iraq are far from simple, with intra-Kurdish rivalries; ethnic, sectarian and political divisions in Baghdad; and a war against the Islamic State barely in the rearview mirror. And yet too many people in Washington and elsewhere seem myopically focused on just one factor: Iran, which they view as controlling and dominating the situation in Iraq in pursuit of an ambitious, expansionist foreign policy. That’s far from the full story.Since coming to power in 2014, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq has worked to push back against Iranian hegemony. Although he is (like the Iranian government) Shiite, he professes to be first and foremost an Iraqi nationalist. And he is certainly not an adherent of the Iranian government’s revolutionary ideology.This doesn’t make Mr. Abadi unique. Most Iraqi Shiites likewise don’t want to see their country become Tehran’s puppet. The populist Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr now openly opposes Iranian dominance. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the Iraqi who is the global spiritual leader of all Shiites, has criticized Tehran’s interference, and in September, he refused to meet with a top Iranian cleric who had been dispatched by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Even the Popular Mobilization Forces, a constellation of some 60 Shiite-dominated paramilitary groups in Iraq, are divided: Some are aligned with Iran, others oppose it.To balance Iranian influence, Mr. Abadi has sought to build alliances with other local, regional and international players. He has visited Saudi Arabia, Iran’s regional nemesis, twice in recent months and has established strong ties with Washington.The prime minister has also become increasingly popular with Iraq’s Sunnis, who are wary of Iran’s deep penetration into the Iraqi state since 2003 and now see Mr. Abadi as a conciliatory figure and a safeguard against too much Iranian influence.The evolution of the fight against the Islamic State has revealed this balancing act. When the Islamic State swept across Iraq in the summer of 2014, Iran came to the rescue, quickly providing material and tactical support. Later, when Iraqi forces were advancing against the Islamic State, Mr. Abadi invited a United States-led coalition to join the fight — despite strong Iranian objections. And in more recent battles, Mr. Abadi has kept Iranian proxies back from the front lines.This is some of the context that too many in Washington are ignoring right now as they view the tension between Baghdad and the Kurds as one piece in an Iranian gambit for control.Iran is, of course, involved in its neighbor’s politics and battles. In fact, Iran is the strongest foreign actor in Iraq. And when it comes to Iraq, Tehran is always one step ahead of Washington and its allies because its relationships with groups from different sects and ethnicities give it a better understanding of the political terrain.For instance, while American officials were left scrambling after the Kurdish Regional Government declined to postpone the referendum, Iran knew better — and was better prepared for the immediate aftermath of the vote. Iran is successful because it relies on powerful local allies, including friendly Shiite paramilitaries within the Popular Mobilization Forces. It also has a long-running relationship with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, one of the leading Kurdish parties.This doesn’t translate to a desire to destroy Iraq. Iran, remembering the deadly war of the 1980s, wants to ensure that Iraq is not powerful. But its interests also include relative stability and a secure border. It can’t have the Islamic State too close; the Iraqi collapse in 2014 alarmed Tehran.The fear in Washington has been the opposite: that Iran’s activities in Iraq are malign and destabilizing.Since 2003, officials in Washington keep getting Iran wrong. Many are understandably still scarred by the 1979 hostage crisis or Iranian-supported Iraqi militias killing American soldiers in 2003. Or they are concerned about Iranian threats to Israel. When it comes to Iran in Iraq, emotion fogs reality, limiting understanding in Washington. Yet for Iran, when it comes to the United States in the Middle East, pragmatism guides policy, translating to more successes.For the Iraqi government, Iran is a foreign actor just like the United States is. Iraqi leaders view Iranian officials in their country — including Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’ elite Quds Force — as international military advises, just as they view American military advisers. Both are first looking out for their country’s national interests. The Iraqi government does not assign any ethical or moral superiority to one over the other, and it still needs both.To finally get Iraq right, the United States must move past its obsessive denial based on a fear of Iranian influence, recognize that Tehran’s abilities are limited and appreciate the fine line that the government in Baghdad has to walk. Until then, the Iranophobes will be right about one thing: Iran is the smarter player in the region.', '', 'SARPOL-E-ZAHAB, Iran – Survivors in Iran are awaiting badly needed aid, three days after a powerful earthquake along the Iraq border killed more than 530 people and left thousands injured.Many in the Kurdish town of Sarpol-e Zahab, home to half the casualties from the temblor, say they still haven\'t received sufficient relief and need help to remove the debris so they could try to get to their damaged homes and retrieve some essential belongings.Reports say more than 12,000 tents have been distributed in the area, though more than 30,000 houses are affected — 15,500 of them completely destroyed.

Now Afghan Fighters Are a Worry at Home. - The New York TimesYAKAWLANG, Afghanistan — Iran has trained and deployed thousands of Shiite Afghans as shock troops in Syria’s sectarian war. Members of the Afghan unit, the Fatemiyoun Division, wear a shoulder patch recounting words of praise from Iran’s supreme leader as a badge of honor.What those fighters might do when they come home is now very much on the minds of officials who fear that Afghanistan may become the next great sectarian battleground between Iran, as the declared guardian of Shiites, and Saudi Arabia, long the sponsor of conservative Sunni doctrine around the world.“This is quite dangerous: What happens to this Fatemiyoun force when the war in Syria is over?” said Rahmatullah Nabil, a former Afghan intelligence chief. “The fear is that rivalry in the region, between Iran and Saudi, will shift to Afghanistan. And I think that clash is already shifting here.”There is reason for worry. First, there’s a history: The factional divisions that drove Afghanistan’s devastating civil war in the 1990s were seized on by foreign powers who were seeking proxies. And there’s a new concern: A stark increase in attacks against Afghanistan’s Shiite minority, mostly by Sunni extremists loyal to the Islamic State, is already providing Iran a pretext to increase its meddling in the country.The attacks have received wide coverage in the Iranian news media. And one Fatemiyoun fighter who returned about three months ago from Syria said the violence against Afghan Shiites was a frequent topic raised by their commanders in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.The Afghan fighter had returned to his home in Yakawlang, a village in Bamian Province where the Taliban massacred more than 300 Shiites in 2001. Every year, hundreds of residents kneel on the dirt in a hilltop cemetery and beat their chests in mourning for their loved ones, their names listed on a metal sign worn out by time and covered in rust.“The Guards commanders were saying that, if it comes to it, we will make Bamian into a base for you, a base for Fatemiyoun,” said the returning fighter, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being singled out for attack.“There was always talk about that; the commander would say that one day you will go defend in your own country,” said another fighter, who had lived in Iran for 20 years as a refugee before he joined to go to Syria. He said he enlisted after he saw a video of Islamic State fighters “playing football with a chopped head.” His relatives said he joined after a romantic heartbreak.Iran has long relied more on soft power than armed might in Afghanistan, playing up its cultural, religious and economic influence in western Afghan districts near the border. And though Iran resents the presence of the United States military on its border, it has mostly supported the American-backed administration in Kabul, choosing stability over chaos.But as the war in Afghanistan has stretched late into a second decade, and with the stability of the central government in question, Iran has begun hedging its bets, American and Afghan officials say. That has extended to improving its ties with the Taliban, a group it had long seen as an ideological enemy.Afghan officials acknowledge that they have not yet seen evidence that Iran was actively rallying Fatemiyoun veterans. But the officials are deeply concerned that the groundwork is being laid. And statements by Iran’s military leaders, as well as their use of Afghan fighters in other conflicts, suggests that Iran sees the force as an asset in future engagements.Brig. Gen. Ismail Qaani, the deputy commander of the Quds force within the Revolutionary Guards, recently told a memorial for Afghan fighters that Syria was just a temporary goal in a larger vision.“Fatemiyoun is a new culture — a collection of brave men who do not see boundaries and borders in defending Islamic values,” General Qaani said, as quoted in the local Iranian media.The war in Yemen is one indication of how Afghans are already being drawn deeper into the Iranian-Saudi rivalry, on both sides. Not only did Iran send smaller units of the Fatemiyoun to cross Syrian borders and fight in Yemen, but at least 1,000 Sunni Afghan refugees from camps in Pakistan have also been recruited to fight on Saudi Arabia’s behalf in Yemen, according to three senior Afghan officials.The core of what is now the Fatemiyoun Division included fighters from Shiite militias that had Iranian support during the Afghan civil war. Some even went to Iraq to fight on behalf of Iran against Saddam Hussein, or to Lebanon to oppose the Israeli invasion.Many of the Afghan fighters, mostly recruited from among Afghan refugees or illegal laborers in Iran, join for the salary of about $600 a month, and for the promise of Iranian residency paperwork after a deployment to Syria, which usually lasts three months. But they soon realize that the benefits are designed as a hook: The paperwork needs to be validated every year, and that requires enlisting again.“Here, I am scared — of the government, of Daesh,” said one former Fatemiyoun fighter who has returned to Kabul, using another name for the Islamic State. “And if I don’t go back to Syria, my Iranian passport will lose validity.”Afghan officials say the Iranian police have intensified a crackdown on illegal Afghan immigrants, arresting as many as 200 a day. When they arrive at deportation centers, Iranian military officers are there to offer another option.“They said: ‘You had come from Afghanistan to work, to make money. We give you two options: You go to Syria, and we pay you money. Or you go back to your country,’” said the former fighter in Yakawlang, who asked to be identified only as Jawed. He was detained while working at an Iranian construction site and taken to a deportation center where, out of 200 Afghan detainees, he became one of about 60 who chose to serve in Syria. After returning to Afghanistan, he joined the Afghan Army.Extensive ideological indoctrination is a central part of their service. Recruits are told the war in Syria is a defense of some of the holiest shrines of the Shiite faith from attack by the Islamic State — a group their recruiters then describe as a creation of the United States to destabilize the Middle East.“My intention was Syria, to defend the shrine,” said the Afghan fighter who returned to his home in Yakawlang, and who wanted to be identified only by the name Abas.Abas described his fellow Afghan fighters being pitched into battles that resembled the brutality of the Afghan civil war.“You know how the Afghan boys fight — they wouldn’t even leave a chicken behind,” he said. “A unit leader would say, ‘We will capture this hill. What is in it for us? We want this much money.’ Three hundred people would go, 30 would come back.”Other fighters described similarly heavy casualties. One said 15 of his comrades were killed on the first night they arrived at the front lines. And Jawed said there was a day when his unit lost 45 men.“They tell you are defending the shrine of Zainab, and that is true: We believe in defending our religion and faith,” Jawed said. “But when you get there, you realize you have been brought to the slaughterhouse of a war of major powers.”', 'The Talk of Turkey? A Politically Charged Trial in New York - The New York TimesISTANBUL — The trial is about to start in a Lower Manhattan courtroom, but it is the talk of Turkish government officials, television and even cafes.Turkey is churning over the prosecution by the American authorities of two prominent Turks accused of conspiring to violate United States sanctions against Iran. After a failed campaign to persuade American officials to drop the case, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week turned to damage control, angrily denigrating the whole judicial process.On Monday, jury selection is to begin in the Federal District Court trial amid broad speculation that the lead defendant, Reza Zarrab, who is accused of managing a billion-dollar scheme to smuggle gold for Iranian oil, has entered into a plea bargain with the prosecution and may reveal damaging evidence about corruption and illegal dealings in high places.If Mr. Zarrab has indeed become a government witness, prosecutors are still expected to proceed to trial against a co-defendant, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Turkish banker who has pleaded not guilty. Seven other defendants have been charged but remain at large, prosecutors have said.Mr. Zarrab’s arrest in March 2016 — while on a family trip to Disney World — raised tensions between Turkey and the United States, and on the eve of trial, relations between the two NATO allies are now at their lowest point in years.Mr. Erdogan himself could face political consequences should Mr. Zarrab testify, if there are any convictions or if the United States takes action against Turkish banks found to have been involved in the scheme. The president faces a re-election campaign in 2019 or earlier.Mr. Erdogan has cast the trial as a continuation of a coup attempt against him last year, and his officials have begun a sweeping media campaign to depict the case as a conspiracy against Turkey and the charges as fabricated.“We know too well, the issue here is not the future of our party, but the fate of our country,” Mr. Erdogan told Parliament in a weekly address on Tuesday. “Under the cover of rule of law, one of the major traps against our country has been devised.”But opposition politicians have jumped on the case. “What’s nationalist about corruption?” said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the Republican People’s Party.As the trial approached and Mr. Zarrab was moved from a New York jail to an unknown location, the Turkish media went into a frenzy of speculation over whether he was cooperating with prosecutors. Officials made several inquiries to the United States as to his whereabouts, and government ministers came out of their shells to engage the foreign news media and try to play down the importance of any testimony by Mr. Zarrab.“Why should I be concerned?” Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said, when asked about possible revelations that could come from Mr. Zarrab’s testimony. “I did not drink untreated milk, so why should I worry about my stomach?”The level of denial by the government is a clear indicator of how worried it is about the Zarrab case, including the risk it may pose for the economy, said Atilla Yesilada, Turkey analyst for the New-York based management consultancy GlobalSource Partners. “There is huge concern,” he said.Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly raised the issue with American officials, including in a phone call with President Trump in September. That call followed the announcement by prosecutors of a new indictment broadening the case to nine defendants.Even without the added tension of the case, Turkey and the United States have been falling out in the past two years over the United States’ support for Kurdish militia forces in Syria and Washington’s reluctance to extradite the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey accuses of fomenting last year’s failed coup.For its part, the United States has been expressing concern over Mr. Erdogan’s increasingly authoritarian rule, in particular his imposition of a state of emergency since the coup attempt.Turkey has pushed back against what it sees as American pressure. It has detained two United States consular staff members and nine Americans on terrorism charges. And it has negotiated a deal to buy Russian S-400 surface-to-air missiles.In October, the deterioration in relations between the two countries burst into the open when the United States suspended visa services in Turkey and Turkey followed with reciprocal action.Mr. Erdogan’s government has long maintained that it has abided by the United Nations sanctions aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear weapons program. But it has openly disagreed with additional United States sanctions on buying oil and gas from Iran.“Nothing has been done in secret,” the economy minister, Nihat Zeybekci, told a Turkish newspaper. “It is extremely transparent.”Mr. Zarrab, 34, an Iranian-Turk who ran a foreign exchange business and gold dealership, managed an oil-for-gold arrangement that drew him accolades in Turkey. For four or five years, the trade allowed his country to import oil and gas and use the profits to lower its trade deficit, Mr. Zarrab said at the time.It also made Mr. Zarrab fabulously wealthy. His wife, the Turkish pop star Ebru Gundes, once bragged that he had promised to buy her the planet Mars.The American indictment says that Mr. Zarrab bribed Turkish bank and customs officials, including a former economy minister, Zafer Caglayan, with millions of dollars. Mr. Caglayan is one of the defendants named in the case who prosecutors have said are still at large. Another is Suleyman Aslan, a former general manager of Halkbank, a state-owned Turkish bank that helped facilitate the scheme, the indictment says.In 2013, Turkey’s organized crime and financial crimes police units arrested Mr. Zarrab, Mr. Aslan and the sons of three ministers and even issued a summons to Mr. Erdogan’s son. But the government stepped in to release them and the investigation was dropped.Mr. Erdogan dismissed the 2013 investigation as a thinly veiled attack against his government and his family by followers of Mr. Gulen, a former Islamist ally who became increasingly critical of Mr. Erdogan’s leadership and what he said was the corruption of his government. Turkish police officials who worked on the Zarrab case were later detained in widespread purges, and four of the prosecutors are wanted by the authorities.Now, Mr. Erdogan’s government is accusing American prosecutors of building their case on the same evidence — fabricated evidence, they say — used by Gulenist prosecutors in 2013. “When this plot failed, they set up the same plot in the U.S.,” the president told Parliament.Turkey’s justice minister, Abdulhamit Gul, told reporters in Istanbul in September that the case was built on “used chewing gum” and would “cast a shadow on the American legal system.”“We expect the U.S.A. not to be involved in a political drive to humiliate the Turkish nation, and damage relations with the great and ancient Turkish Republic,” Mr. Gul said.With tensions escalating, Turkey said it had opened an investigation of Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan whose office first charged Mr. Zarrab, and of his successor, Joon H. Kim.Mr. Kim said last week that he was aware of claims that the case was being driven by Turkish domestic politics and that his office, the Justice Department and court had been infiltrated by Gulenists. He called such claims “ridiculous on their face.”And Mr. Bharara responded dismissively to a statement by Mr. Cavusoglu, Turkey’s foreign minister, that Mr. Bharara was “very close” to Mr. Gulen.“Turkey FM is a liar,” Mr. Bharara said on Twitter. “Now let’s see what happens in court.”', 'Iran’s President Defends Yemeni Rebel Attack on Saudi Capital - The New York TimesTEHRAN — President Hassan Rouhani of Iran stood his ground on Wednesday in an escalating regional showdown, defending a Yemeni rebel missile attack on the Saudi capital that Saudi Arabia has denounced as an Iranian “act of war.”Saudi forces were “constantly bombing” Yemen, Mr. Rouhani said, adding: “What reaction can the nation of Yemen show toward this amount of bombardment? They say that they should not use weapons? Well, you stop the bombs, and then see if you don’t get a positive reaction from the nation of Yemen.”The conflict in Yemen, described by the United Nations as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, is one of several proxy battles between the two powers, with Iran supporting Houthi rebels who have controlled much of Yemen since 2014 and Saudi Arabia fighting to restore the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi.Over recent days, however, aggressive moves in Yemen and from Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, seem to have pushed the cold war for regional dominance into a new and dangerous stage.Saudi Arabia said on Saturday that it had intercepted a missile fired from Yemen over the international airport of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.“We see this as an act of war,” the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said in an interview on CNN on Monday. “Iran cannot lob missiles at Saudi cities and towns and expect us not to take steps.”Iranian commanders have denied any role in providing Houthi rebels with missiles.The attack coincided with a surprise development in another country where the Saudis and the Iranians contend for influence: Lebanon. The Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, announced his resignation on Saturday in a televised address from Riyadh, accusing Iran of “sowing fear and destruction” in the region and saying that he feared for his life.Mr. Rouhani, in remarks to a cabinet meeting and posted on his official website, also attacked Saudi Arabia, saying it had forced out Mr. Hariri.“In history we don’t know of an example that a country, in order to interfere with the affair of another country, would force the official of that country to resign,” Mr. Rouhani said.A day after Mr. Hariri’s bizarre resignation came a wave of high-level arrests in Saudi Arabia that appeared to complete a consolidation of power by the 32-year-old Prince Mohammed.No Iranian official has given a reaction to the arrests, but Mr. Rouhani appeared to refer to them briefly on Wednesday.“If you are struggling with domestic problems inside Arabia, you should try to resolve them,” he said. “Why do you get others into trouble because of your own domestic problems and talk against all the nations of the region?”Iran’s leaders are likely to be privately pleased at the arrests, Iranian analysts say, seeing the detentions as a purge with the potential to weaken their rivals.Over all, Iran has been trying to avoid tensions with Saudi Arabia. It recently agreed to allow Switzerland to open an office to represent Saudi interests in Tehran, with the promise of establishing an Iranian-interest section in Riyadh.On Wednesday, Mr. Rouhani called for dialogue. “I hope that new Saudi officials will stop their enmity with the regional nations and will chose the path of friendship,” he said. “They should know that respect for others will not do harm. They should know that Iran wants nothing but creating stability and security in the region.”', 'Saudi Arabia’s Special Power Over Donald Trump - The New York TimesConsider this foreign policy challenge: A Mideast leader undertakes a stunning power play to cement domestic control, carrying out mass arrests without due process and installing loyalists in key ministries. He ratchets up criticism of a regional rival and accuses it of effectively declaring war. And another Mideast leader, while on a visit to the first one’s country, abruptly resigns and doesn’t return home.If all this were happening in Iran, it’s a fair guess that President Trump, Congress and a host of other voices would react with outrage. In truth, the scenario sums up what’s been happening in Saudi Arabia in the last week under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. And Mr. Trump could not have been more effusive. “I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing,” he tweeted.There’s a big difference, of course, between Saudi Arabia and Iran; the former is an American ally, the latter an antagonist. But it has not been American practice to give allies a free pass when they’re destabilizing the region, and Saudi policies, both domestic and foreign, have become increasingly aggressive under Crown Prince Mohammed. In addition to his power play, he’s escalated Saudi involvement in Yemen; continued his boycott of Qatar, ostensibly another American ally; and made inflammatory statements about Iran. Saad Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, resigned a week ago while in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in circumstances that remain a mystery.No problem, suggests Mr. Trump, who made clear early on that he would side with the kingdom and its Sunni allies against Shiite-led Iran. But there is a problem: Mr. Trump’s uncritical support of the prince’s behavior is stirring fears of a war with Iran and undermining American interests.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson knows this, even if his boss doesn’t. On Friday Mr. Tillerson reaffirmed Lebanon’s independence, hailed Mr. Hariri and cautioned against using Lebanon for proxy conflicts. His words were a stern, if indirect, admonishment to Saudi Arabia. And to his boss in the Oval Office. Though why should a headstrong Saudi prince pay any attention to an American underling who has been repeatedly undermined by that same boss?', 'SANAA, Yemen – Yemeni Houthi rebels have directly rebutted U.S. assertions that a missile launched into Saudi Arabia earlier this month was manufactured by Shiite ally Iran.Col. Aziz Rashed, a spokesman for rebel-allied forces, said Sunday that the missile intercepted by the Saudis near the capital Riyadh on Nov. 4 was "Yemeni-produced." The U.S. contends that the ballistic missile was Iranian-made and remnants of it bore "Iranian markings."Rashed added however that if the rebels could obtain "strategic weapons from any state, we would not hesitate one moment."A Saudi-led, U.S.-backed coalition allied with Yemen\'s internationally recognized government has been at war with the rebels since March 2015. The Houthis control most of northern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa.The coalition tightened its blockade on Yemen after the missile was fired.', 'The Saudi Roundup at the Ritz - The New York TimesCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s wholesale arrests in Saudi Arabia have been seen as fundamentally a power play to cement his internal control over the kingdom. But his aggressive moves to reshape both his country and the Middle East are likely to have wider consequences, further destabilizing a region already in turmoil while increasing the chances of a Saudi war with Iran. At this moment, when the United States, the kingdom’s trusted ally, should be counseling restraint, President Trump unwisely keeps giving the impetuous crown prince a green light.Prince Mohammed, 32 and inexperienced, has been shaking up the conservative kingdom ever since his father, King Salman, installed him as first in the line of succession and made him defense minister in 2015. Some of his reforms are admirable, necessary, long overdue and overwhelmingly popular with millions of younger Saudis. He has allowed women to drive and to run for municipal office, and reined in hard-line clerics. But the pace of change and the methods he has chosen to achieve it, as well as his belligerent approach toward Iran, have raised questions about his judgment.That was certainly true on Sunday when he shattered the consensus-driven, 70-year-old governing structure by arresting as many as 500 people, who are being detained at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh, including at least 11 princes; the head of the most important military branch, the National Guard; and Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world’s richest men, who has been a major shareholder in Citigroup, Apple and Twitter.The arrests were presented as a crackdown on corruption. Some of those detained are expected to face undisclosed criminal charges, and others may be pressured to testify about their roles in corruption schemes. Corruption and entrenched interests are serious problems in Saudi Arabia, and the crackdown is expected to be welcomed by the citizenry. Even so, the kingdom does not have a credible or transparent justice system, and it is far from certain that those arrested will be treated fairly.The roundup has rattled the markets and could undermine the crown prince’s signature project, known as Saudi Vision 2030, to catapult the country into the modern age with an economic agenda that would invite foreign investment and reduce the kingdom’s dependence on oil by selling off shares of Aramco, the Saudi oil giant. Though powerful Saudi interest groups appear to have acquiesced in the moves, some international investors fear a period of internal dissension that could mean the project’s collapse; indeed, Western intelligence analysts do not rule out the possibility of a coup once the king dies.By eliminating rivals, Prince Mohammed apparently hopes to have a freer hand to pursue an increasingly aggressive approach toward Iran. That is an even greater concern. Saudi Arabia, a Sunni-majority country, sees Shiite-majority Iran as its chief rival for regional influence and has enlisted Mr. Trump in its efforts to constrain Iran. The two states are already fighting proxy wars in Yemen and Syria and are competing for political influence in Lebanon and Iraq. And Saudi Arabia is leading an effort to boycott and ostracize Qatar because it has dealings with Iran.On Saturday, Prince Mohammed sucked Lebanon into the anti-Iran vortex. He hosted — and almost certainly pressured — Prime Minister Saad Hariri, Saudi Arabia’s chief Lebanese client, into announcing his resignation. This disrupted the power-sharing government in Beirut in which Hezbollah, the Iran-backed political party and militia, plays a lead role. The Saudis said Mr. Hariri didn’t do enough to rein in Hezbollah. On Monday, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said a missile fired from Yemen over the weekend was an “act of war” by Iran, which is supporting Houthi rebels against the Saudi-backed internationally recognized government. Many experts say the origin of the missile is not clear. But the Saudi rhetoric seemed intended to create a rationale for going after Iran.The Trump administration has done little to temper Saudi Arabia’s regional ambitions or moderate its inflammatory approach to Iran; in fact it has done the opposite. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, has visited Riyadh at least three times this year, including holding extensive talks with the crown prince a few days ago. Mr. Trump himself has displayed nothing but hostility toward Iran and urged the Saudis and their allies to be even more aggressive in their approach. So far he has said nothing about the arrests, suggesting tacit approval.Prince Mohammed is fighting many battles, with mixed results, on many fronts, against Yemen, Qatar and his own political system. Cooler heads — whether in Washington or Riyadh — should counsel him not to add a war with Iran to his list.', 'TEHRAN, Iran – Rescuers are digging through the debris of buildings felled by an earthquake that killed more than 430 people in the border region of Iran and Iraq.The work is taking place two days after a magnitude-7.3 earthquake struck Sunday night Iran time, just as people were going to bed.The worst damage appeared to be in the Kurdish town of Sarpol-e-Zahab in the western Iranian province of Kermanshah, which sits in the Zagros Mountains that divide the two countries.Residents fled without time to grab their possessions as apartment complexes collapsed into rubble.

Putin of Russia met with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, an indication that Mr. Assad had agreed to the idea. Mr. Putin also called President Trump and other regional leaders, reflecting what appeared to be a coordinated effort that highlighted Russia’s role.Mr. Putin sought to use the Sochi announcement to portray Russia as a flexible diplomatic intermediary in the Syria conflict, despite Russia’s military backing for Mr. Assad, widely regarded by opponents as a war criminal.“The Syrian people are to decide their future themselves,” said Mr. Putin. “Obviously, the reform process will not be easy and will require compromise and concessions from all of its participants, including the Syrian government.”The war has displaced half the Syrian population and created a protracted humanitarian crisis, with millions of Syrian refugees in neighboring countries.Precisely who among Mr. Assad’s adversaries would be invited to the Sochi conference, and when it will be convened, have not been made clear yet.Russia, Mr. Assad’s chief ally, helped turn the tide of the conflict in his favor with a major military intervention two years ago.Mr. Assad’s forces have since reclaimed most of the country from Islamist militants and insurgents who had sought to topple him, including rebel groups backed by the United States and some of its allies.In their joint statement, the Russian, Iranian and Turkish leaders called on representatives of the Syrian opposition “that are committed to the sovereignty, independence, unity, territorial integrity and non-fractional character of the Syrian state” to take part in the Sochi conference.Mr. Putin, sitting with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, said the most important purpose of the conference would be to frame “the future structure” of the Syrian state.Their announcement coincided with a meeting of Syrian opposition factions in Saudi Arabia, who were trying to form a unified position before the Geneva talks on Nov. 28.For many members of the Syrian opposition, peace in Syria is unattainable before Mr. Assad is held accountable for human rights abuses, including what United Nations investigators have said was the use of chemical weapons by Syria’s military.There were signs on Wednesday that the opposition remained challenged in finding a common position on Mr. Assad.Al Arabiya, the Saudi-owned news website, reported that the High Negotiations Committee, which has represented the opposition at previous Geneva talks, had been troubled in recent days by 10 resignations, including its leader, Riyad Hijab. Al Arabiya said he had taken an “uncompromising line” against Mr. Assad’s participation in Syria’s postwar future.For Mr. Erdogan, the main issue is whether American-backed Kurdish forces in Syria should be involved in any political settlement. Mr. Erdogan regards those forces as enemy affiliates of Kurdish insurgents in Turkey.“The exclusion of terrorist aspects from the process, is still among Turkey’s priorities,” Mr. Erdogan said.At the United Nations, officials sought to portray the Sochi announcement as constructive, which in no way undermined Mr. de Mistura’s efforts.Farhan Haq, a United Nations spokesman, said: “Our focus remains on the meetings that will begin in Geneva on Nov. 28. We hope that all the other processes that are underway will contribute to a successful round of talks.”', '4 Ways Trump Has Moved to Undo His Predecessors’ Legacies - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump has had nothing but sharp words for some of the most notable accomplishments of his Democratic predecessors Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.But, as The New York Times’s Peter Baker notes, Mr. Trump’s tough statements have so far not been matched by his actions. Instead, he has partially dismantled some programs and then left it to Congress to figure out the next steps.Here’s a look at four of the most significant areas where Mr. Trump has acted to undo his predecessors’ accomplishments, and where those actions now stand.Mr. Obama’s signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act, became law in 2010, and in the following years, calls for its repeal became a centerpiece of Republican political efforts and a core element of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign.What Mr. Trump Has Done: The Trump administration has made a variety of moves, including two major actions on Thursday, that could fundamentally undermine the viability of the federal health care marketplaces, a central part of the law.The most recent actions — allowing insurance companies to sell less expensive plans with fewer benefits and ending subsidies to insurance companies that help low-income consumers pay out-of-pocket costs — are the latest in a series of initiatives that strike at the heart of the insurance marketplaces set up under the law. Earlier moves included cuts to advertising and services that help consumers sign up for plans on the marketplaces, as well as an effort to weaken enforcement of the individual mandate.Where Things Stand Now: Congress tried on multiple occasions this year to pass a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, but was never able to muster the votes needed in the Senate, even after the House passed a plan on its second attempt in May.Efforts to pass a repeal in Congress appeared to die at the end of September with the expiration of a procedural deadline that would have allowed changes to pass with only 50 votes.For now, the law’s provisions remain in effect, but many people will be closely watching whether the Trump administration’s executive actions drive insurance companies to withdraw from the federal health care exchanges, or, if they stay, whether premiums will rise uncontrollably._____The United States and five other world powers reached a deal with Iran in July 2015 to limit that country’s nuclear program in exchange for lifting crippling international sanctions. The Obama administration argued that while the deal did not include all of the provisions it wanted, it was the “best bet” toward curbing Iran’s nuclear capabilities.What Mr. Trump Has Done: On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump regularly denounced the deal, saying that it did not last long enough and that it did not cover ballistic missile launches or Iranian involvement in regional terrorist activity. After reluctantly recertifying the deal in July, Mr. Trump said Friday that he would not certify Iran’s compliance again.Where Things Stand Now: While Friday’s move did not scuttle the deal, it leaves its fate in the hands of Congress. Mr. Trump said he would ask Congress to establish “trigger points” that would prompt the re-imposition of sanctions if Iran crossed certain thresholds. Mr. Trump also threatened that “in the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.”_____After years of negotiations, the United States, Mexico and Canada agreed to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect at the beginning of 1994. The deal, struck during the Clinton administration, eliminated tariffs on most goods traded between the three countries.In the nearly two and a half decades since, trade among the three countries has more than tripled, and companies have built complex supply chains that crisscross the continent’s borders.What Mr. Trump Has Done: Mr. Trump, a longtime critic of free-trade deals, regularly attacked Nafta during the campaign, calling it one of the worst deals in history. In the early months of his presidency, he repeatedly threatened to unilaterally withdraw the United States from the trade pact, but ultimately agreed to open negotiations with Canada and Mexico on an amended agreement.Where Things Stand Now: Negotiators have conducted several rounds of talks, but on Wednesday, before the fourth round of contentious trade negotiations began, Mr. Trump once again condemned the fairness of the deal. “It’s possible we won’t be able to make a deal, and it’s possible that we will,” the president said, while sitting next to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada. “We’ll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers.” Mr. Trump’s comments again raised the prospect that the deal may yet collapse, with potentially unintended consequences._____Mr. Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in June 2012 aiming to protect from deportation undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. The so-called Dreamers who have benefited from the program now number approximately 800,000.What Mr. Trump Has Done: Mr. Trump repeatedly railed against the program on the campaign trail, but after taking office he has seemed  torn about how to handle the issue. He ultimately ordered an end to the program in September, calling it an “amnesty-first approach.”Where Things Stand Now: In announcing his move, Mr. Trump called on Congress to pass a replacement plan within six months, before the program is to be fully phased out. Since then, he has said he is willing to “revisit” his decision if Congress does not come up with a fix. The top Democrats in Congress — Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi — said in mid-September that they had come to an agreement with Mr. Trump to pass a replacement, but in early October, Mr. Trump delivered to Congress a list of hard-line demands on immigration policy that may make building Democratic support for a deal more difficult.', '                                    FILE - This undated file photo distributed by the North Korean government shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at an undisclosed location in North Korea.                                                                             (KCNA via KNS)                                                                    Reporters continue scratching their heads about what President Trump meant when he spoke of the “calm before the storm” Thursday as he was hosting a dinner for military commanders and their spouses. It seems clear to me that he was sending a powerful message to North Korea and Iran: change your behavior now, or prepare to face new but unspecified painful consequences.North Korea and Iran are taking the measure of President Trump to see how far they can push him and how much they can get away with. The North Koreans continue testing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and threaten to launch a nuclear attack on America and our allies that could kills millions. Iran is likely engaging in activities that could contribute to the design and development of its own nuclear explosive device.If these worrisome actions by the two rogue nations persist, there will be a storm. And as candidate Trump said during his campaign for the White House, he will not tell our enemies what kind of storm to expect – only that he will not allow current trends that endanger our national security and that of our allies to continue unabated.The president must make some difficult decisions: whether to continue to rely on economic sanctions that don’t appear to be working against North Korea; and whether to refuse to certify Iranian compliance with the bad nuclear deal and demand that additional constraints be placed on the Islamic Republic’s dangerous and provocative activities.President Trump faces an Oct. 15 deadline to decide whether to certify Iranian compliance with the nuclear agreement, which is designed to keep it from developing nuclear weapons for the next few years. News reports say he is expected to refuse to make that certification.U.S. policy toward both Iran and North Korea is closely related, because we must prevent Iran from joining the nuclear club and becoming another, even more dangerous version of North Korea.The sad reality is that even if Iran were to comply with the letter of the nuclear agreement, it will still be able to develop the capability to build up a vast nuclear arsenal within a relatively short time. This is the fundamental flaw of the agreement.And Iran claims that the nuclear deal permits it to refuse to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect military facilities. This has led the IAEA to conclude that it cannot assure the world that Iran is not even now designing and developing a nuclear arsenal with missiles capable of delivering them to American allies in the Mideast and Europe, and soon the U.S. itself.All the Iranians need to do to become a nuclear power is to start spinning centrifuges. The nuclear agreement, which was reached with the Obama administration in 2015, will allow them to do that in a few years.So whether we like it or not, a storm is coming. Whether that storm will be diplomatic, economic or military depends on the leaders of North Korea and Iran. If they choose to negotiate constraints on their increasingly dangerous activities, they can avoid the other more painful options.Our military options are andshould always be a last resort. They are the worst possible options – other than Iran developing a nuclear arsenal and North Korea developing a nuclear delivery system that can reach our population centers and wipe out major American cities.With fanatical dictators like those in control of North Korea and Iran, we cannot rely on containment and deterrence as acceptable policies to prevent them from using nuclear weapons, as we have done for years with the Soviet Union (and now Russia) and China.So President Trump cannot afford to wait and do nothing as Iran and North Korea grow ever stronger, ever more menacing and become greater and greater threats. He must do something – now. The nature of what is done, and what kind of storm it may be, is up to our enemies. I hope they choose wisely.Alan M.

Oil prices have been edging up since July and are now well above their early-2016 lows of less than $30 a barrel.After notable declines in recent years, are oil prices now on an upward trend? And how would that affect the world economy?After the Americans established a no-fly zone in 1991 that protected Kurdish areas from attack by troops loyal to Saddam Hussein, the Kurds carved out an autonomous region in northern Iraq, with its own government, parliament and military. The Kurdish region also exports its own oil, although Baghdad disputes the legality of these sales.Kurdish fighters known as the pesh merga have played a central role, alongside Iraqi troops, in operations against the Islamic State.Last month, however, the Kurds voted for full independence from Iraq, prompting an angry rebuke from Baghdad and threats of military intervention.Both Turkey and Iran fear that an independence move by Iraqi Kurds could set off unrest among their own Kurdish minorities. The United States and most of the international community had opposed the referendum, saying it could unleash ethnic conflict, break up Iraq and undermine the campaign against Islamic State militants.On Monday, Iraqi forces said that they had reached the outskirts of Kirkuk, seizing oil fields and other sites from Kurdish forces.The area around Kirkuk and the Kurdish region is one of the major oil-producing areas of Iraq. Analysts estimate that the region as a whole produces 750,000 barrels a day, of which around 400,000 comes from fields around Kirkuk that could be caught up in the conflict. The Kurdistan regional government exports about 640,000 barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris, with about 300,000 coming from Kirkuk.Iraq produces a total of about 4.5 million barrels a day.Most of the oil exported from the Kirkuk and Kurdistan area goes north, through a pipeline across the border with Turkey, and then to Ceyhan, a Turkish port on the Mediterranean. Turkey has threatened to cut off those exports, although Ankara has taken no action thus far.Oil prices recently have become more sensitive to supply threats, such as the situation in Kirkuk.Strong global demand and the agreement between Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb production have tightened the market and helped soak up some of the surplus. That means further reductions because of global crises become more important.“We have got a cocktail of geopolitical risks that can certainly keep supporting prices and probably — if demand stays strong — contribute to pushing them higher,” said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm based in London.Rising crude oil prices have translated into modestly higher prices for consumers. The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline in the United States is about $2.50, a little less than 10 percent more than a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration, a government agency.In Britain, prices for unleaded regular gasoline have risen by about 4 percent to about 544 pence, or about $7.20, per gallon, according to data from the AA, an auto services group. Because of the high tax component in European fuel prices, the prices are less sensitive to fluctuating costs of crude than are gasoline prices in the United States.There seems a good chance that oil prices will push at least modestly higher over the next few years. Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said prices of $60 to $70 a barrel, or even higher, were likely.Mr. Clint said he doubted that modest increases would drive fuel prices high enough to slow major economies like those of the United States or Germany. “In the range I am talking about, I don’t think so,” he said.Others say that higher prices could just encourage more supply, for example by shale oil producers in the United States, which would keep prices from escalating.', '', 'DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – The BBC says it has filed a complaint with the United Nations over Iran freezing the assets of over 150 people associated with its Persian service.In a statement Wednesday, the BBC said those assets were frozen as part of a criminal investigation by Iranian authorities into the broadcaster\'s employees, former staff and contributors over allegations of a "conspiracy against national security."Iran\'s mission at the U.N. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The BBC first announced the asset freeze in August.The BBC\'s Farsi-language service is barred from operating in Iran, though many Iranians listen to its radio shows and watch its satellite television broadcasts. The BBC says the service reaches some 18 million people weekly who are hungry for news outside of Iran\'s state-controlled broadcasters.', 'Nuclear Scientists Urge Congress to Protect Iran Deal - The New York TimesMore than 90 top American experts in atomic sciences, including a designer of the hydrogen bomb, publicly threw their weight behind the Iran nuclear agreement on Monday, exhorting Congress to preserve the accord in the face of President Trump’s disavowal of it.In a letter to Senate and House leaders of both parties that emphasized the “momentous responsibilities” Congress bears regarding the agreement, the scientists asserted that the accord was effective in blocking Iran’s pathways to a nuclear weapon.“Congress should act to ensure that the United States remains a party to the agreement,” read the letter, signed by what amounted to a who’s who of prominent physicists and other luminaries in American science.The letter said the signers were offering their perspective “as scientists who understand the physics and technology of nuclear power, of nuclear explosives, and of long-range missiles; and who collectively bring their experience with nuclear nonproliferation.”They included Richard L. Garwin, a 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient and nonproliferation advocate, whose work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the early 1950s gave birth to the hydrogen bomb; all three winners of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics; and Siegfried S. Hecker, a former director of Los Alamos who is internationally regarded as an authority on nuclear security threats.Mr. Trump has described the 2015 agreement, negotiated under the Obama administration, as a giveaway to Iran and “one of the worst” deals ever, and has said it should be renegotiated or disbanded.He has criticized provisions of the agreement that expire over the next two decades and has complained that it does not ban Iranian missile development or stop other actions by Iran deemed to counter American interests.European allies of the United States that are parties to the nuclear agreement have urged the Trump administration to respect it. Iran has said the accord cannot be renegotiated.The scientists said Mr. Trump’s objections could be addressed without a renegotiation, which their letter called an “unrealistic objective.”Their letter reflected the intense lobbying underway in Congress by supporters and opponents of the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which lifted many sanctions on Iran in return for its verifiable promises of peaceful nuclear work.The lobbying has accelerated since Mr. Trump, as part of an aggressive new strategy to confront Iran, announced a few weeks ago that he would no longer certify Iran’s compliance with the agreement, as required every 90 days under an American law.Mr. Trump’s action essentially shifted the fate of the agreement to Congress, which may now reimpose sanctions on Iran in the next few months. Such a step may unravel the entire agreement.While the scientists did not dispute Mr. Trump’s objections, they emphasized that under the accord, severe restrictions on Iran’s supply of uranium remain in place through 2030, surveillance of Iran’s uranium-enriching centrifuges remains through 2035, and surveillance of uranium mines and mills through 2040.Iran will then remain subject to strong safeguards enforced by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear-monitoring arm of the United Nations.The agency has said Iran is complying with the nuclear agreement’s provisions. Iran has always asserted that it does not seek nuclear weapons.The scientists’ letter also recommended additional ways to monitor Iran — or any other non-nuclear state, for that matter — without renouncing the nuclear agreement.They proposed stronger verification at uranium enrichment plants in non-nuclear states, in addition to multinational control of such plants, which could “provide an extra layer of security against their misuse to produce material for nuclear weapons.”The Iran agreement, the scientists said, is “necessary to provide the time needed to develop and implement these initiatives.”Earlier Monday, prominent opponents of the nuclear agreement issued a statement expressing strong support for Mr. Trump’s position. Their statement said the agreement must be changed to address what they called deficiencies that put Iran “on a legal glide path to a nuclear weapons arsenal.”The statement was released by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based group that has strongly criticized Iran on a range of issues including the nuclear agreement.More than 20 former government officials and experts on Iran signed that statement, including Elliott Abrams, Robert G. Joseph and Mary Beth Long, who held high-ranking positions on security and defense under President George W. Bush’s administration; and Olli Heinonen, a former deputy director general at the International Atomic Energy Agency.', 'Iran\'s president insisted his country is living up to its side of the agreement and criticized Trump as a neophyte on foreign policy; John Roberts has the roundup on \'Special Report\'Iran will continue its missile program and is not in violation of international accords, President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday on state television, reports Reuters.Rouhani spoke days after the U.S. House of Representatives voted for new sanctions against Iran’s ballistic missile program as part of an effort to clamp down on Tehran.He also met the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog in Tehran, who again vouched for Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord that curbed its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, which has drawn fire from President Donald Trump, who has called the agreement spearheaded by President Barack Obama the "worst deal."The United States already has imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its missile tests violate a U.N. resolution that calls on Tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani speaks in an open session of parliament, in Tehran, Iran, Sunday, Oct. 29, 2017.(AP)IRAN ASKS UN NUCLEAR CHIEF TO CONFIRM IT STILL FOLLOWS DEALIran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has no plans to build nuclear-capable missiles.Reuters reports that Rouhani also criticized the United States over Trump’s refusal this month to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord on Iran’s nuclear program, even though international inspectors confirm that it is.“You are disregarding past negotiations and agreements approved by the U.N. Security Council and expect others to negotiate with you?” said Rouhani, according to Reuters.“Because of the behavior it has adopted, America should forget any future talks and agreement with other countries,” Rouhaniadded, referring to unnamed countries in East Asia, an apparent reference to North Korea.', '', 'Afghan Teenagers Recruited in Iran to Fight in Syria, Group Says - The New York TimesBEIRUT, Lebanon — Afghan immigrant children as young as 14 are being recruited in Iran to fight — and die — in Syria, a prominent human rights organization said Sunday.The group, Human Rights Watch, said it had verified the deaths of eight Afghan children in Iran, who were recruited and ultimately died fighting for the Fatemiyoun division in Syria, by inspecting tombstones in cemeteries in Iran, cross-referencing them against the names of fighters reported dead in Iranian news reports, and by speaking to the families of several of the teenagers.The Human Rights Watch report demonstrates that Afghan fighters younger than 18 have died in Syria, and it sheds new light on the recruitment of Afghan Shiites to fight in Syria, where Iran backs the Syrian government in a multisided war. Iran is home to many Afghans, who have traveled there to work or as refugees fleeing conflict in their country. Human rights groups have long expressed concern that vulnerable Afghan refugees are being pressured by the Iranian authorities to fight in Syria.More graves for teenage fighters are believed to exist, Human Rights Watch says, citing reports of fighters’ deaths in the Iranian news media. According to the group’s report, some of the children’s epitaphs identify their place of death as Syria, while some tombstones bear the inscription “defender of the shrine” — a reference to Sayyida Zainab, an important shrine in Syria revered by the Shiite sect of Islam, to which many Afghans and Iranians belong.The Fatemiyoun, a division within Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that is actively fighting alongside Syrian government forces, consists exclusively of Afghan immigrants to Iran. The Iranian Interior Ministry estimated in 2015 that 2.5 million Afghans lived in Iran, but many do not possess residency permits.The process of attaining legal status is lengthy and difficult for immigrants, and without it, life is challenging for Afghans in Iran. Human Rights Watch contends that many Afghan refugees in Iran who were said to have volunteered to fight in Syria were motivated by promises of legal residency status and residency permits for their families.“We spoke to one person who fought as part of the Fatemiyoun Division and he said that he was able to receive a residency permit upon return,” said Tara Sepehri Far, a researcher at Human Rights Watch who lead the report. “He explained that he was approached by a recruiter when he was going to the office at the Interior Ministry, which deals with the situation of Afghan permits in Iran.”Under international law, military recruits must be at least 18, and the training or deployment of soldiers younger than 15 is considered to be a war crime. Some of the tombstones identified by Human Rights Watch put the ages of death at 18, but further investigations by the group found that the children who had died had lied about their age in order to join the Fatemiyoun Division.“It does not appear to be a deliberate policy to recruit children,” Ms. Sepehri Far said. “It’s more of a sloppiness that the authorities and recruiters don’t care enough to ask for proof of age.”Syria’s six-and-a-half-year civil war has attracted foreign fighters from every corner of the world, many of whom are serving as proxies for other countries or groups. The convoluted war has a documented history of human rights violations and war crimes committed by every side of the conflict, and reports of child soldiers fighting in various militias have circulated before.', 'Former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton explains why President Trump should abandon the Iran nuclear deal, one of the major foreign policy achievements of the Obama administration that limits the ability of Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. An Iranian negotiator who helped clinched the 2015 nuclear deal has been sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted of espionage in Iran.Abdolrasoul Dorri Esfahani, who has dual Iranian-Canadian citizenship, is known to be have been the member of Iran’s team of nuclear negotiators. He worked on a team focusing on ensuring economic sanctions were lifted against Iran as part of the deal."The conviction of a member of the nuclear negotiation team who has been arrested before and released on bail has been confirmed in the Tehran provincial appeals court," an Iranian semi-official news agency reported Wednesday.His sentence was reported by Iranian news agency Tasnim, which is thought to be close to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard – a hard-line faction following the orders of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and often involved in detaining Iranians with links to the West.Iran does not recognize dual nationals and such individuals have faced secret charges behind closed doors before Iran’s Revolutionary Court, which rules in cases involving attempts to overthrow the Islamic regime.The United Nations recently criticized Iran for detaining nationals with dual citizenships, calling it an “emerging pattern” since the nuclear deal was signed.Esfahani was reportedly detained in 2016 but was later granted bail – a rare occurrence in Iran for those accused of serious crimes.He had a history of working for the Iranian government, including working at The Hague, Netherlands, where he mediated disputes between Iran and the U.S. government over pre-1979 Islamic Revolution purchases of military equipment from the U.S. He also served as an adviser to the head of Iran’s Central Bank.Other dual nationals detained in Iran include Chinese-American student Xiyue Wang, who was sentenced for 10 years for allegedly “infiltrating” the country as he was conducting university research on an Iranian royal dynasty of the 18th century.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman, was also sentenced to five years behind bars after being found guilty of conspiracy to topple the Iranian government while traveling in the country with her young daughter.Multiple other dual nationals have also been found guilty and imprisoned based on espionage charges in Iran.The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'LONDON – British Prime Minister Theresa May is urging the United States to extend the Iran nuclear deal, saying it is "vitally important for regional security."May\'s office says she and U.S. President Donald Trump spoke late Tuesday and both sides agreed their teams would remain in contact ahead of Trump\'s decision on the pact. Trump has threatened to scrap the agreement, calling it the "worst deal ever." He must recertify the measure by Oct. 15 because of unilateral conditions set by Congress.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to stress the benefits of the deal, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.China, France, Russia, Germany, Britain and the European Union ratified the deal.', '', 'Europe Looks to Congress in Fight to Save Iran Nuclear Pact - The New York TimesBRUSSELS — Having apparently lost the fight to dissuade President Trump from decertifying the Iran nuclear deal, the European countries that signed the pact are now looking to the United States Congress as a last chance to preserve the treaty and some shred of Western unity.Mr. Trump, who has described the deal as “disastrous” and “the worst deal ever,” must decide by mid-October whether to certify that Iran is in compliance with the nuclear agreement — something he has done only reluctantly twice before.Reports from Washington suggest that Mr. Trump will in fact decertify the deal, overruling his own national security team, but at the same time quietly encourage Congress not to reimpose punitive economic sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the accord.European diplomats say the European nations that signed the accord are hoping to use the same arguments that failed to sway the president as they press American lawmakers to preserve an agreement that they see as essential to maintaining regional stability. They contend that the North Korean nuclear crisis is difficult enough without starting a new one unnecessarily, that American credibility is at stake and that Western division over Iran can only benefit Russia.Iran, for its part, is in full compliance with the deal, senior European diplomats say. But they note that some in the Trump administration are using a preamble to the agreement that Iran itself desired to argue that Tehran is not in compliance with “the spirit” of the agreement. As evidence, they point to Tehran’s missile program and its military support for the Lebanese Shiite militia group operating in Syria, Hezbollah.But the Europeans argue that none of these issues are covered in the agreement, which was specifically limited to Iran’s nuclear program; they are instead subject to separate sanctions.Mr. Trump cannot wreck the nuclear deal with a stroke of the pen. If he refuses to certify it, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. Even if that happens, a dispute resolution process written into the deal provides another month before it is clear that the United States is no longer a party to an agreement accepted by its main allies, the rest of the United Nations Security Council and Iran.Traditionally, opposition to Iran runs deep in Congress, even among many Democrats. But there are indications that Congress has little appetite to reimpose sanctions, and analysts have said that if Mr. Trump quietly asks Republican hawks on Iran, like Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, to hold off, they probably would.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis came out  publicly on Tuesday in favor of sticking with the deal, while saying that Iran continued to support terrorism and was failing to comply with what he called “the spirit” of the agreement. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson also supports the agreement, though his differences with President Trump have exploded into view lately.Reports in Washington nevertheless suggest that Mr. Tillerson and others around the president are working on a plan under which Mr. Trump would decertify Iran, but Congress would not reimpose sanctions. After that, Congress would rescind the current law requiring Mr. Trump to issue an opinion on Iran’s compliance every 90 days.Instead, the administration would work with Congress and the Europeans to toughen other sanctions against Iran for its other troublesome activities, including new sanctions against its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, headed by hard-line military commanders and an important economic driver of the Iranian economy.Mr. Tillerson floated the idea to European counterparts at the United Nations last month, a meeting the Europeans orchestrated so that China spoke first of its support for retaining the deal, and then Russia, before the Europeans did.The agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was signed in July 2015 by the five permanent members of the Security Council – Russia, China, the United States, France and Britain – plus Germany; the European Union led the negotiations and did a lot of the legwork.It was devised to ensure that Iran could not build a nuclear bomb, which Iran has said it never intended to do, by severely limiting uranium enrichment for weapons purposes and eliminating the production of plutonium, while allowing for intrusive new inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure compliance. In return, punitive economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union were lifted.The I.A.E.A. has certified Iran’s compliance with up to 400 inspections so far, including 25 unannounced inspections, the diplomats said.Mr. Trump has twice certified Iran’s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, first in April and then in July, but only after telling his national security team that he was very unhappy with doing so and wanted more options.Trump supporters like John R. Bolton, a former United States ambassador to the United Nations, have urged Mr. Trump simply to abandon the deal. Mr. Trump “should cut and cut cleanly,” Mr. Bolton argued recently in The Wall Street Journal. “The ayatollahs are using Mr. Obama’s handiwork to legitimize their terrorist state, facilitate (and conceal) their continuing nuclear-weapons and ballistic-missile programs, and acquire valuable resources from gullible negotiating partners.”He argued against the reported Tillerson compromise, calling it “too cute by half.”For Pierre Vimont, a former senior European diplomat and French ambassador to Washington, what is at stake is a larger effort to manage and limit Iranian influence in the Middle East – the very issue that drives Mr. Trump and Washington’s Sunni allies.“The Sunnis say they are more concerned about Iranian influence generally than the nuclear program,” Mr. Vimont said, “and the nuclear deal was part of the whole process to bring Iran back to a better path.“But if you start with the Americans decertifying and more sanctions, it’s a field day for the extremists in Iran, for the Revolutionary Guard, and the supreme leader will back them, and we fear that any hope to bring more stability in the region will vanish.”There is also the question of American credibility and reliability, Mr. Vimont said, pointing to North Korea and Russia. Already, he noted, traditional American allies like Egypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia are exploring better ties with Moscow, which is seen as “more predictable, more serious and more rational” now than Washington, he said.The European diplomats also say that decertifying the Iran deal would complicate matters with North Korea. The North would be far less likely to negotiate a dismantling or a halt to its own overtly military nuclear program if the UnIted States failed to keep its commitments in the Iran deal.“What kind of signal would this send to countries like North Korea?” asked Peter Wittig, the German ambassador to the United States, during an appearance in Washington where he was joined by his counterparts from Britain, France and the European Union in strongly backing the Iran nuclear agreement. “It would send a signal that diplomacy is not reliable, that you can’t trust diplomatic agreements, and that would affect, I believe, our credibility in the West when we’re not honoring an agreement that Iran has not violated.”There are “larger issues” at stake, Mr. Wittig said, including an increased danger that Iran would resume uranium enrichment, the risk of a nuclear arms race in an unstable region and the impact on global nonproliferation efforts.In sum, said David O’Sullivan, the European Union’s ambassador to the United States, “We agree that the demise of this agreement would be a major loss.”', 'Struggle Over Kirkuk Puts the U.S. and Iran on the Same Side - The New York TimesBAGHDAD — When the Iraqi military battled Kurdish forces this week to reclaim the contested city of Kirkuk, the spectacle of one American-backed ally fighting another with American-supplied weapons was not the only incongruous sight.Another was the United States turning its back on a crucial ally in the fight against the Islamic State, the Kurds, as Washington’s goals aligned with those of a regional nemesis, Iran.While the military action in Kirkuk on Monday and Tuesday was carried out under the banner of the Iraqi military, the ground forces included Iranian-backed Shiite militias.American officials, including President Trump, insisted that the United States was not taking sides in the dispute, but some analysts say that the United States approved the Iraqi plan to enter Kurdish-held areas and that Iran helped broker the agreement with a Kurdish faction to withdraw its fighters from Kirkuk, allowing the Iraqi forces to take over largely unopposed.“Abadi would not have attacked without informing the U.S.,” said David L. Phillips, a former State Department adviser who worked on Iraq for 30 years, referring to the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi. “At a minimum, the U.S. knew that the attack was coming.”Maria Fantappie, senior analyst for Iraq at the International Crisis Group, said, “The United States gave a green light, and that was essential.”Iran’s goal, she said, was to insert Shiite militias into contested areas, and to divide the Kurds while solidifying Iranian influence over the Iraqi government.Intentionally or not, the United States seems to have abetted that goal as it pursued its own aim of restoring Iraqi government authority to the disputed Kirkuk region. The United States, officials said, also declined to defend the Kurds to show its displeasure with them for rejecting an American request to cancel a referendum on independence from Iraq.Supporters of the Kurdish Regional Government, the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq, said they expected better from the United States after 1,700 Kurdish fighters died helping the Americans fight the Islamic State.“I don’t want to use the word betrayal,” Vahal Ali, the communications director for the region’s president, said Wednesday, “but we definitely feel the United States has been negligent.”He said the Kurds were “disappointed at how the United States looked at this.”“Now they are giving Iraq to Iran as a present,” he added. “That’s as diplomatic as I can be.”Joshua A. Geltzer, the former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council, noted the irony of helping Iran just as Mr. Trump was threatening to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement and assailing the country for sponsoring terrorism.“It seems like we just got out of the way as Baghdad rolled the Kurds, and that doesn’t feel right,” he said. “Plus, it makes little sense for an administration interested in getting tougher on Iran.”The turn of events stems from the referendum the Kurds held three weeks ago, in which they voted overwhelmingly for independence from Iraq. Although the vote did not lead to a declaration of independence, it was vigorously opposed by nearly every power in the region.Iran, which wields considerable influence in Baghdad, feared any move toward independence by the Kurds in Iraq would inflame separatist sentiments among its own Kurdish minority. The United States opposed the vote over, among other reasons, concern that it would rupture the coalition of Iraqi and Kurdish forces battling the Islamic State in Iraq.The Kurdish Regional Government’s determination to go ahead with the referendum, chasing the dream of an independent Kurdish homeland, has backfired spectacularly.In just two days this week, Iraqi troops took Kirkuk and most other contested areas that Kurdish forces have held since 2014, including oil fields that have provided the bulk of revenues for the Kurdish region.The assault crushed Kurdish dreams of independence and raised serious questions about the political judgment and future of the Kurdish leader, Massoud Barzani.In retrospect, the depth of Mr. Barzani’s miscalculations is clear if still surprising. He badly overestimated his bargaining position with Iraq and underestimated the animosity his referendum engendered among his neighbors and allies, including the United States. After the referendum, American officials told Mr. Barzani that he had forfeited the good will of the United States.For the last three years, the Kurdish militia known as the pesh merga was a crucial ally for the United States and Baghdad in the battle against the Islamic State, often proving more effective than the Iraqi army.But less than two weeks after the Sept. 25 referendum, Iraqi forces drove Islamic State militants out of Hawija, their last major urban stronghold in Iraq and the last battle in which the pesh merga played a role. The fight has shifted to the western desert of Anbar Province, far from pesh merga positions in northern Iraq.“Barzani had very little leverage before and he has absolutely no leverage now,” said Denise Natali, a Middle East specialist at the National Defense University in Washington.As Iraqi forces massed on the Kurdish border and Kurdish officials warned of an impending invasion, Mr. Abadi, the Iraqi prime minister, insisted that Iraq did not plan to assault Kirkuk and dismissed reports to the contrary as “fake news.” American officials did not dispute his assertions.Asked Wednesday whether the United States had approved Baghdad’s military plans, Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said, “We have long called for a unified, democratic Iraq.”The other surprise was that much of the pesh merga in Kirkuk, loyal to a Kurdish faction opposed to Mr. Barzani, had agreed to make way for the advancing Iraqi force.Attention has since focused on a meeting on the weekend before the Iraqi assault between a prominent Iranian military commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, and members of that faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.Gen. Khatab Omar, the police chief in Kirkuk, said General Suleimani held talks over the weekend with the P.U.K. in Kirkuk and in the Kurdish city of Sulaymaniyah. Mr. Ali, the Kurdish government spokesman, said General Suleimani manipulated events to bring Shiite militias into areas vacated by the pesh merga.When the first pesh merga withdrawals began on Friday from two districts south of Kirkuk in Shiite areas, Shiite militias accompanying Iraqi troops raised their flags over former Kurdish outposts.There has been speculation that General Suleimani brokered the deal for the Kurdish forces to abandon Kirkuk, but Saadi Bira, a spokesman for the P.U.K., said local pesh merga commanders negotiated the agreement with the Iraqi government.General Suleimani has been a pivotal, if shadowy, figure in Iraq for years. As the head of Iran’s foreign military operations, he directed Shiite fighters who killed hundreds of American troops in Iraq. In 2014, he wrote a provision incorporating Shiite volunteer fighters into the Iraqi armed forces, the so-called Iraqi Hezbollah, a reference to the Iranian-backed Shiite militia in Lebanon.Jennifer Cafarella, senior intelligence planner at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, said that an agreement organized by General Suleimani was “the most likely scenario in an event this strategically significant for Iran.”“It does also seem likely that he was instrumental in forcing the Kurds to step down,” she added. A spokesman for the American Embassy in Baghdad said the operation had involved Iraqi troops, apparently with the cooperation of Kurdish forces, regaining government control of disputed territory.The Iraqi operation also forced a military confrontation between two American-backed allies. Both the pesh merga and the Iraqi military have received American training, intelligence and supporting airstrikes and artillery in several joint operations against the militants.Senator John McCain, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was incensed. “The United States provided equipment and training to the government of Iraq to fight ISIS and secure itself from external threats — not to attack elements of one of its own regional governments, which is a longstanding and valuable partner of the United States,” he said in a statement.Mr. McCain warned of “severe consequences” if American-supplied military equipment was destroyed in the operation. The Kurdish government said Monday that its fighters had destroyed five American-supplied Humvees used by the Iraqis.', 'Assessing Trump’s Criticisms of Iran and the Nuclear Deal - The New York TimesPresident Trump declared his intention not to recertify the Iran nuclear deal in a forceful speech on Friday. But the rationale he provided includes several misleading or incomplete statements about the terms of the deal, what he considers a violation of the agreement and Iran itself. Here is an assessment.Mr. Trump gave an incomplete account of Iranian history. “Iran is under the control of a fanatical regime that seized power in 1979 and forced a proud people to submit to its extremist rule,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the Islamic Revolution. Clerics led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew the monarch that year and established an Islamic republic. His successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is currently the supreme leader of Iran.Mr. Trump then listed the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, Iran’s sponsorship of terrorism and its support of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria among other examples of the country’s “hostile actions.”All of these actions are undoubtedly hostile, but they require more context, said Abbas Amanat, an Iran scholar at Yale University, who added that the 1979 revolution was a popular movement and that the government, though repressive, has been moderating.Mr. Trump’s history lesson omitted a critical recent turning point: the 2009 Green Movement, when protesters took to Iran’s streets to dispute the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and call for more political freedom. Some even demanded for the removal of Ayatollah Khamenei. In 2013, Iranian voters delivered the presidency to Hassan Rouhani, a more moderate cleric, by a wide margin. His allies made strong gains in parliamentary elections in 2016, and Mr. Rouhani was re-elected this May.“Any attempt to renege or decertify or impose sanctions again has a tremendously negative impact on the current moderates in Iran” who support Mr. Rouhani and, in turn, would fuel hard-liners, Mr. Amanat said.Mr. Trump misled about the deal’s “immediate financial boost” to Iran. Mr. Trump claimed that the deal gave Iran “over $100 billion its government could use to fund terrorism” and a “massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion.” The diplomatic agreement did not cut Iran a check, but it did release about $100 billion in previously Iranian frozen assets. Much of the amount is tied up in debt obligations. For example, $20 billion is owed to China for financing projects in Iran. Estimates for the actual amount available to Iran range from $35 billion to $65 billion.The Obama administration did transfer $1.7 billion to Iran, but Mr. Trump’s statement requires more context. The money — delivered in cash, some on a plane — was payment for a decades-long dispute and was indirectly linked to the nuclear deal.Before the 1979 revolution, Iran’s shah had paid $400 million for American military goods but, after he was overthrown, they were never delivered. The clerics who seized control demanded the money back, but the United States refused. The additional $1.3 billion is interest accumulated over 35 years. An initial reimbursement was released after the Iran deal was implemented and to help secure the release of American hostages.Mr. Trump claimed, without providing evidence, that “the regime intimidated international inspectors into not using the full inspection authorities that the agreement calls for.”The White House did not respond when asked to identify an instance of intimidation. But the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the watchdog group tasked with inspection, has yet to report issues with access.“To my knowledge, there is no evidence of this. The I.A.E.A. has never said that this is the case,” said Richard Nephew, a former sanctions coordinator at the State Department and a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.Yukiya Amano, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s director general, repeatedly stated in a September news briefing that Iran was following the rules. He did not mention any instances of intimidation.“We have had access to locations more frequently than many other countries with extensive nuclear programs,” he said of Iran.After Mr. Trump’s speech on Friday, Mr. Amano issued his own statement.“So far, the I.A.E.A. has had access to all locations it needed to visit,” he said. “At present, Iran is subject to the world’s most robust nuclear verification regime.”Mr. Trump exaggerated when he suggested the deal’s “sunset clauses” are imminent.Mr. Trump claimed that provisions in the deal limiting Iran’s nuclear abilities expire “in just a few years.” In reality, the major provisions last a decade or longer. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a vocal critic of the deal, said it “largely expires after only 15 years.”Iran cannot use more than 5,060 centrifuges to enrich uranium — and it cannot pursue research and development on centrifuges — for 10 years. Limits on enrichment levels, facilities and stockpiles last for 15 years, according to a September report from the Congressional Research Service.Under the terms of the accord, Iran also agreed to convert a deep underground enrichment facility into a “technology center” that cannot contain nuclear material and where the number of centrifuges is limited for 15 years. Several provisions on plutonium, including forbidding the construction of new heavy water reactors, last for 15 years.Inspectors are to monitor centrifuges and related infrastructure for 15 years, verify inventory for 20 years and monitor uranium mines for 25 years.', 'Promise the Moon? Easy for Trump. But Now Comes the Reckoning. - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump leaves little doubt about what he thinks of his predecessor’s top domestic and international legacies. The health care program enacted by President Barack Obama is “outrageous” and “absolutely destroying everything in its wake.” The nuclear deal with Iran is “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.”Yet as much as he has set his sights on them, Mr. Trump after nearly nine months in office has not actually gotten rid of either. Instead, in the past few days, he took partial steps to undercut both initiatives and then left it to Congress to figure out what to do next. Whether either will ultimately survive in some form has become a central suspense of Mr. Trump’s first year in office.In the case of health care, Mr. Trump is making a virtue of necessity. Having failed to push through legislation replacing the Affordable Care Act, he is taking more limited measures on his own authority aimed at chipping away at the law. On the other hand, when it comes to the Iran deal, he has the authority to walk away without anyone else’s consent but has been talked out of going that far by his national security team. Instead, by refusing to recertify the deal, he rhetorically disavows the pact without directly pulling out.These are not the only instances in which Mr. Trump’s expansive language has not been matched by his actions during this opening phase of his presidency. On immigration, diplomatic relations with Cuba and international accords like the North American Free Trade Agreement and a separate trade pact with South Korea, he has denounced decisions made by Mr. Obama or other previous presidents without fully reversing them.“Presidential campaigns are won with big, simple, directional promises that rarely align well with the complexity confronted in the Oval Office,” said Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican former governor of Utah and secretary of health and human services who advised Mr. Trump’s transition team. “So presidents do the best they can to stretch the fabric of incomplete outcomes to cover as much bare backside as possible and move on.”Mr. Trump’s advisers characterize that as the more pragmatic side of a businessman who takes maximalist positions in part to set the stage for negotiations but does not necessarily intend to go as far as he might give the impression. His critics said that the partial steps were still destructive, and that the president was effectively leaving initiatives like health care and the Iran deal wounded on the battlefield without allowing ambulances onto the scene.A question for the president is whether partial actions will satisfy supporters demanding a full repudiation of the Obama era. Mr. Trump promised to deal with such issues in some cases within his first days in office but has found that Washington resists quick action. Frustrated by Congress, he is increasingly turning to executive power and can point to the moves he has made as signs of his commitment to fulfilling his promises.“The gap between President Trump’s ambitious promises and actual policies is large and growing,” said William C. Inboden, a White House aide under President George W. Bush and now executive director of the William P. Clements Jr. Center on History, Strategy and Statecraft at the University of Texas. “This is weakening the institution of the presidency itself, which becomes diminished when presidents over promise and under deliver, or when responsibilities normally handled by the president become habitually shirked to Congress or other nations.”A cautionary tale is Mr. Obama himself, who made lofty and ambitious heal-the-planet, close-Guantánamo promises only to fall short in some instances, to the disappointment of his liberal supporters. The difference is that Mr. Trump often gives the impression with his public comments that he has gone further than he actually has.“It’s classic Trump: bluff and bombast substituting for actual deeds,” said Jacob Heilbrunn, editor of The National Interest, a foreign policy magazine. “He’s the political equivalent of the Washington Nationals — a choke artist at critical moments.”Mr. Trump pronounced himself happy with the approach he is taking on health care, which has been the most consuming domestic issue of his presidency so far. “We’re going a little different route,” he told an audience of religious conservatives on Friday. “But you know what? In the end, it’s going to be just as effective, and maybe it’ll even be better.”Later in the day, he acknowledged that his new strategy on Iran would not actually scrap the nuclear deal but would allow Congress to come up with an alternative. Asked why he did not simply terminate the agreement, he said: “I may very well do that. But I like a two-step process much better.”Democrats said Mr. Trump’s actions were meant to sabotage the health care program and undermine the Iran deal even without full repeal. By cutting subsidies to insurance companies, “it’s clear the president is trying to sabotage the health care market and send costs soaring,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland denounced what he called “the president’s reckless, political decision and his subsequent threat to Congress” on the Iran agreement.Mr. Trump has taken partial steps on other campaign promises as well. He signed an order scrapping his predecessor’s program granting legal status to as many as 800,000 younger immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children, but delayed the final effect for six months to give Congress a chance to restore it on a more solid legal foundation. Even then, he suggested that he would find another way to preserve the program if Congress did not meet his deadline.He has boasted that he was reversing Mr. Obama’s diplomatic opening to Cuba. But while he has pulled out many diplomats and restored some restrictions on contacts with the island, he has not cut off relations again, closed the embassy or shut down travel and other interactions. He has talked about throwing out Nafta, but has actually left it intact and has taken the route of negotiating to see if it can be retained with improved provisions.“I am not surprised because Donald Trump is not an ideologue, he’s a realist and a pragmatist,” said Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of the president’s. “During the campaign, he staked out some very strong positions maybe as a negotiating start point, or in other cases they were based on the facts he had at the time.”“Trump is actually very open to feedback and criticism on his ideas,” Mr. Ruddy said. “Based on that he can easily adjust and change course.”Clifford Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, said the president seemed to be trying to translate business negotiations to the political world. “Trump’s clearly got a theory of deal-making — demand the world, take the most you can, and then brag about it,” he said. “It’s actually a pretty good tack that’s often underestimated. But the bottom line, so far in his presidency, is that he’s been unable to deliver on overstated goals.”In the end, he may wind up taking the more sweeping actions — he may yet pull the United States out of Nafta or the Iran deal. He may yet let the program for younger immigrants expire early next year. He has repeatedly talked about “letting Obamacare fail,” which his latest steps may accelerate.“There is now a new and scary spring in his step,” Mr. Kupchan said. “He could be entering a new phase involving fuller takedowns of agreements and institutions. The Iran deal and Nafta are bellwether cases. What’s really interesting is that he fired his chief revolutionary, Steve Bannon, but seems on the verge of taking on that role himself.”', 'PARIS – France has reaffirmed its support for the Iran nuclear deal following the decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to no longer back it in its current form.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian said Thursday after a meeting in Paris with head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, that the deal "remains valid despite the decision of the president of the United States not to certify its implementation."Trump announced last week that he would not re-certify the deal to Congress and would terminate the Obama-era pact if Congress can\'t come up with new legislation satisfying him on the agreement.Amano also met with French President Emmanuel Macron, who encouraged the IAEA to ensure strict adherence to the deal "in all its aspects."', 'BRUSSELS – The leaders of the 28 members of the European Union are showing their support for the Iran nuclear agreement, despite U.S. President Donald Trump\'s opposition to it.EU spokesman Preben Aaman tweeted that the EU leaders agreed at a summit Thursday to show their joint commitment to the international agreement curbing Iran\'s nuclear program.The EU leaders called the 2015 deal a pillar of efforts to reduce the global nuclear threat. Some fear that walking away from the deal could compromise chances of encouraging North Korea to negotiate on its nuclear program.Trump "decertified" the deal Friday, angrily accusing Iran of violating it, and directed the U.S. Congress to make it more stringent.The International Atomic Energy Agency has certified eight times that Iran was living up to its commitments.', '', '', '', 'Is Trump Going to Lie Our Way Into War With Iran? - The New York TimesA decade and a half ago, in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, President George W. Bush’s administration conjured up not only terrifying images of nuclear mushroom clouds but also of Saddam Hussein plotting with Osama bin Laden to attack the United States.Mr. Bush himself declared that Mr. Hussein “aids and protects terrorists, including members of Al Qaeda” while Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld called links between Iraq and Al Qaeda “accurate and not debatable.”It wasn’t true, of course. But it helped make the case for war.That may be why a similar lie is getting trotted out again now, except this time the target is Iraq’s neighbor, Iran.On Oct. 13, in his statement decertifying the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump claimed that Tehran “provides assistance to Al Qaeda.” The following week, his C.I.A. chief, Mike Pompeo, went further: “It’s an open secret and not classified information that there have been relationships, there are connections,” Mr. Pompeo said at an event hosted by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a neoconservative think tank. “There have been times the Iranians have worked alongside Al Qaeda.”On Nov. 1, the C.I.A. released a new batch of nearly 470,000 files recovered in the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan. But the agency did more than just release the documents to the public. It provided advance copies to the foundation’s online publication, Long War Journal. (The C.I.A. said it was common practice to distribute declassified documents to the news media and academic organizations on an embargoed basis and that the only agenda in releasing these files was “to enhance public understanding” of Al Qaeda.)Long War Journal homed in on a 19-page document by an unidentified Qaeda official who claimed that the Iranian government had offered “Saudi brothers” in Al Qaeda “everything they needed,” including money, arms and training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon, “in exchange for striking American interests in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf.” Yet the Iranian offer, admitted the official, was never accepted by Al Qaeda — if such an offer was in fact made.The timing of these latest claims from the president and his C.I.A. chief are hardly coincidental. Tensions in the Middle East are ramping up. America’s chief allies in the region, Saudi Arabia and Israel, are pushing even more aggressively than usual to confront Iran. With the Obama administration gone, they have found a soul mate in the White House.President Trump has staffed his administration with hawks who believe that the road to solving the Middle East’s problems runs through Tehran. Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, has accused Iran of trying to “hold the world hostage to its bad behavior.” Defense Secretary James Mattis once described the three biggest threats to American national security as “Iran, Iran, Iran.”A former State Department official who worked under Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, told me that the Trump administration is “obsessed” with Iran in the same way that the Reagan administration was obsessed with the Soviet Union. Inside the government, the former official added, “Iran, ISIS, Al Qaeda, are all mentioned in the same breath, as a menacing threat.”But Americans aren’t exactly itching for a new war. (A majority, in fact, believes the country would be better off staying in the nuclear deal with Iran.) So how can the Trump administration build a case for a pre-emptive strike?Those claims of a nefarious alliance with Al Qaeda might help. The “bomb Iran” crowd has long pointed to the presence of senior Qaeda officials, including members of the Bin Laden family, inside Iran since late 2001.But Iran is far from being a base or command center for Al Qaeda. In 2001, after hundreds of Qaeda fighters crossed into Iran from Afghanistan fleeing American airstrikes, the Iranians deported most of them back to their countries of origin. In 2003, the Iranians offered to swap Qaeda members held under house arrest for members of Mujahedeen Khalq, a militant group that seeks to overthrow the Iranian government, who are being detained by American forces in Iraq.The relationship between the Salafi Sunnis of Al Qaeda and the Shiite clerics of Iran is “not one of alliance” but “highly antagonistic” and “largely based on indirect and unpleasant negotiations over the release of detained jihadis and their families, including members of Bin Ladin’s family,” according to a 2012 report by the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States Military Academy at West Point. The report said that Iran held onto senior Qaeda figures not to protect or assist them but to use them as bargaining chips with the United States and also as a deterrent against Qaeda attacks.When I asked terrorism experts what they made of the alleged Iran-Al Qaeda ties, they were unanimous in their incredulity.“I’ve never seen any evidence of active collaboration,” said Jason Burke, the author of an acclaimed book on Al Qaeda.Ali Soufan, a former F.B.I. agent and the author of the new book “Anatomy of Terror,” dismissed the coverage of the C.I.A.’s documents as an “oversimplification of the facts” and a result of “the Trump administration joining Saudi Arabia’s anti-Iran campaign.”Few would deny that Iran has sponsored groups listed by the United States as “foreign terrorist organizations,” such as Hamas and Hezbollah. But, say the experts, support for Al Qaeda is another matter altogether. As William McCants, a former American government adviser on extremism and author of a recent book on the Islamic State, put it, Iran and Al Qaeda “never embraced as lovers.”So far, none of the documents newly released by the C.I.A. contains a smoking gun. Have Iranian security forces and members of Al Qaeda had contacts, or done deals? Probably. Are there Qaeda figures still living in Iran? Almost definitely. Does that mean there’s an anti-American alliance between Iran and Al Qaeda? No.Mr. Trump, like Mr. Bush before him, is beating the drum for war in the Middle East. But he needs a pretext for an attack on a sovereign nation that, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, is complying with the terms of the nuclear deal. The American public fell for a false pretext in 2003 — and it cannot afford to do so again. Saddam Hussein was not allied with Al Qaeda; for all its faults, neither is the Iranian government.As Mr. Bush himself once famously tried, yet failed, to say: “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.”', '', 'Iran, Italy, Roy Moore: Your Tuesday Briefing - The New York Times', 'TEL AVIV, Israel – A top Israeli government minister says that following the surprising resignation of Lebanon\'s prime minister, Israel is planning a diplomatic offensive against Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah at the United Nations.Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz told The Associated Press on Thursday that he believes conditions are ripe for the world to take a stand against Iranian actions in the region.He says Israel will work with its allies to seek better enforcement of a 2006 cease-fire agreement that called on Hezbollah to disarm and stay away from Israel\'s border.Katz believes Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri\'s resignation exposed what he called "Iran\'s intentions."Hariri said last weekend that he was stepping down and accused Iran of meddling in Arab affairs.', '', 'TEHRAN, Iran – Iranian state TV is reporting a magnitude 4.3 earthquake has injured 36 people in the western province of Lorestan.TV reported the depth of the quake a 10 kilometers (6 miles).Reza Aryaee, an official in the disaster management organization of Lorestan province, said most of the injuries occurred when people rushed to leave their houses.He said most of the injured were discharged after treatment but two have remained hospitalized.Earlier this month, a magnitude 7.3 quake struck along the Iran-Iraq border, killing 530 and injuring more than 9,000.Iran is prone to daily quakes as it sits on many major fault lines.

On Thursday, before Mr. Zarrab, 34, told his story to jurors in Federal District Court in New York, Mr. Erdogan said, “We did not breach the sanctions.”“Whatever the verdict is, we did the right thing,” he said at a closed meeting with his deputies, Turkish state media reported. “We have never made commitments to the U.S. on our energy ties with Iran.”“The world is not only about the U.S.,” he said. “We also have trade and energy relations with Iran.”Mr. Zarrab’s testimony about Mr. Erdogan was relatively brief, coming in the first week of the trial of a Turkish banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, 47, who was also charged in the scheme.Mr. Zarrab testified that it was Zafer Caglayan, Turkey’s economy minister at the time, who said Mr. Erdogan had directed the two banks, Ziraat Bank and VakifBank, to participate in the scheme. Mr. Caglayan “told me that Mr. Prime Minister had given approval for this work,” Mr. Zarrab said through an interpreter, referring to the Iranian trade.On Wednesday, Mr. Zarrab testified that he had paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to Mr. Caglayan; he said Mr. Caglayan asked for 50 percent of the profits generated by the scheme, which prosecutors say was being run through a Turkish state bank, Halkbank. On Thursday, Mr. Zarrab said he had also paid bribes to the general manager of Halkbank, Suleyman Aslan, whom he described as being critical to the arrangement.Mr. Caglayan and Mr. Aslan, who have also been charged in the case, remain at large, prosecutors have said.Mr. Zarrab testified that he had never paid a bribe to Mr. Atilla — the defendant being tried, who was the deputy general manger of Halkbank.In Turkey, reaction to Mr. Zarrab’s allegations was muted. Mainstream television and news outlets have largely kept to the government line that the trial is a plot against Turkey, and have not reported the potentially most explosive allegation: that Mr. Erdogan was involved.Many Turks have turned instead to social media, which has been buzzing about the trial. But some fell quiet after Mr. Zarrab seemed to implicate the president. One Turkish user said on Twitter that he did not dare write what he was hearing — and then deleted even that tweet.Mr. Zarrab maintained his respectful tone in a second day of testimony on Thursday, but one aspect of his appearance did change: his clothing.On Wednesday, Mr. Zarrab testified while wearing tan-colored jail clothes. But after the jury was sent home for the day, Judge Richard M. Berman asked whether there was any reason the witness could not appear in civilian clothes.“It’s hard enough to appear in court,” Judge Berman said. “There is certainly no reason to make things more difficult by not providing, for example, a shirt and a tie or jacket or whatever.” He said he would sign an order to that effect.Even Mr. Atilla, the defendant, who is being held in jail, was granted permission to wear a suit during the trial — a common courtroom practice.On Thursday, Mr. Zarrab testified in a sport coat and white dress shirt, though no tie.When the prosecutor, Sidhardha Kamaraju, asked why he had changed his clothing, Mr. Zarrab said it had been done “with the permission of the honorable judge.”Judge Berman then interjected. “I may be overly sensitive to the clothing issue,” he said wryly. “And the reason is that I’m always hearing in the back of my head my wife saying, ‘What are you wearing?’ So, anyway.”Mr. Zarrab’s testimony continued.', '', '', 'Donald Trump, Iran Earthquake, N.F.L.: Your Monday Briefing - The New York Times (Want to get this briefing by email?

It says he stole episodes from "Curb Your Enthusiasm," \'\'The Deuce" and other series, along with scripts of "Game of Thrones."Prosecutors say Mesri threatened to delete data on HBO\'s computer system or release the stolen material unless he received $6 million in Bitcoin.In a statement Tuesday, HBO said it was working with law enforcement but declined further comment.Mesri is believed to be overseas not in custody.', "VIENNA – A new review by the United Nations agency monitoring Iran's compliance with a treaty that restricts its nuclear activities has not identified any violations by Tehran.The quarterly report issued on Monday by the International Atomic Energy Agency is significant considering U.S. President Donald Trump's criticism of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.Trump last month refused to certify that Iran was in compliance with the agreement. He said Iran had committed several earlier violations and is receiving disproportionate relief from international sanctions.He then gave Congress 60 days to review whether the U.S. should re-impose sanctions on Iran or otherwise amend the conditions for participating in the treaty.Washington stands alone among the six world powers that signed the deal in opposing it.", 'VIENNA, Austria – The head of the U.N. agency monitoring Iran\'s nuclear deal with the U.S. and five other nations says Tehran is living up to its end of the agreement — comments that indirectly oppose President Donald Trump\'s view.The U.S. president refused last month to certify Iran\'s compliance, saying the benefits Tehran is getting from the deal are not proportional to its concessions.Iran limited its nuclear program in exchange for an end to nuclear-related sanctions, but legislation now is pending before Congress that would attach additional conditions for existing U.S. sanctions relief — a move Tehran says would violate the pact.Speaking Thursday, International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano told the IAEA\'s 35-nation board that the "commitments being undertaken by Iran are being implemented."', 'The CIA has declassified nearly a half a million files taken from the Pakistani compound in which Usama bin Laden was killed. Take a look at some of the strange finds.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – The CIA\'s release of documents seized during the 2011 raid that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden has again raised questions about Iran\'s support of the extremist network leading up to the Sept. 11 terror attacks.U.S. intelligence officials and prosecutors have long said Iran formed loose ties to the terror organization from 1991 on, something noted in a 19-page report in Arabic that was included in the release of some 47,000 other documents by the CIA.For its part, Iran has long denied any involvement with al-Qaida. However, the report included in the CIA document dump shows how bin Laden, a Sunni extremist from Iran\'s archrival Saudi Arabia, could look across the Muslim world\'s religious divide to partner with the Mideast\'s Shiite power to target his ultimate enemy, the United States."Anyone who wants to strike America, Iran is ready to support him and help him with their frank and clear rhetoric," the report reads.The Associated Press examined a copy of the report released by the Long War Journal, a publication backed by the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank fiercely critical of Iran and skeptical of its nuclear deal with world powers. The CIA gave the Long War Journal early access to the material.The release comes as President Donald Trump has refused to recertify Iran\'s nuclear deal with world powers and faces domestic pressure at home over investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.The document had been included in the CIA release and was available online Wednesday. The CIA later issued a warning about the files on its website, saying that since the material "was seized from a terrorist organization ... there is no absolute guarantee that all malware has been removed." The CIA then took down the files entirely early Thursday, saying they were "temporarily unavailable pending resolution of a technical issue.""We are working to make the material available again as soon as possible," the CIA said.The unsigned 19-page report is dated in the Islamic calendar year 1428 — 2007 — and offers what appears to be a history of al-Qaida\'s relationship with Iran. It says Iran offered al-Qaida fighters "money and arms and everything they need, and offered them training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon, in return for striking American interests in Saudi Arabia."This coincides with an account offered by the U.S. government\'s 9/11 Commission, which said Iranian officials met with al-Qaida leaders in Sudan in either 1991 or early 1992. The commission said al-Qaida militants later received training in Lebanon from the Shiite militant group Hezbollah, which Iran backs to this day.U.S. prosecutors also said al-Qaida had the backing of Iran and Hezbollah in their 1998 indictment of bin Laden following the al-Qaida truck bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.Al-Qaida\'s apparent siding with Iran may seem surprising today, given the enmity Sunni extremists like those of the Islamic State group have for Shiites.But bin Laden had run out of options by 1991 — the one-time fighter against the Soviets in Afghanistan had fallen out with Saudi Arabia over his opposition to the ultraconservative kingdom hosting U.S. troops during the Gulf War. Meanwhile, Iran had become increasingly nervous about America\'s growing military expansion in the Mideast."The relationship between al-Qaida and Iran demonstrated that the Sunni-Shiite divisions did not necessarily pose an insurmountable barrier to cooperation in terrorist operations," the 9/11 Commission report would later say.Before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York\'s World Trade Center and the Pentagon in Washington, Iran would allow al-Qaida militants to pass through its borders without receiving stamps in their passports or with visas gotten ahead of time at its consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, according to the 19-page report. That helped the organization\'s Saudi members avoid suspicion. They also had contact with Iranian intelligence agents, according to the report.This also matches with U.S. knowledge. Eight of the 10 so-called "muscle" hijackers on Sept. 11 — those who kept passengers under control on the hijacked flights — passed through Iran before arriving in the United States, according to the 9/11 Commission.However, the commission "found no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah was aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack."For its part, Iran has denied having any relationship with al-Qaida since the 1998 attacks on the embassies. Iran quietly offered the U.S. assistance after the Sept. 11 attacks, though relations would sour following President George W. Bush naming it to his "axis of evil" in 2002.Iranian media on Thursday did not immediately report on the release of the 19-page report.The 19-page report describes Iranians later putting al-Qaida leaders and members under house arrest sometime after the Sept. 11 attacks. It mentions the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, saying it put increasing pressure on Iran, especially with the rise of al-Qaida in Iraq."They decided to keep our brothers as a card," the report said.That would come true in in 2015 as Iran reportedly exchanged some al-Qaida leaders for one of its diplomats held in Yemen by the terror group\'s local branch. While Yemen described it as a captive exchange, Tehran instead called it a "difficult and complicated" special operation to secure the Iranian diplomat\'s freedom from the "hands of terrorists.""The repercussions ... of the Sept. 11 attacks were undoubtedly very large and perhaps above (our) imagination," the al-Qaida report said.___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .

They said she went to Iran on a vacation to visit family.Mr. Johnson’s words were quickly seized upon by Iran-state television and, four days later, by the Iranian authorities, who cited them in a court hearing as proof that she had engaged in “propaganda against the regime.”Mr. Johnson at first equivocated, saying his remarks could have been clearer and that there was no doubt that Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been on vacation. But he failed to apologize, prompting a wave of criticism, including calls for opposition lawmakers to call for his resignation.On Monday, Mr. Johnson addressed Parliament again, this time apologizing for the anguish he had caused the family.“I acknowledge that the words that I used were open to being misinterpreted and I apologize to Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family if I have inadvertently caused them any further anguish,” he said. “The house should bear in mind that Iran’s regime, and no one else, has chosen to separate this mother from her infant daughter for reasons even they find it difficult to explain or describe.”Mr. Johnson said that he hoped to meet Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard, before traveling to Iran in a few weeks. Mr. Ratcliffe told the BBC this month that he hoped to accompany the foreign secretary to Iran so he could see his wife for the first time in 19 months, but that he was unsure if his request would be accepted.Mr. Ratcliffe also said he feared for his wife’s health after finding out that she had been taken to a hospital to see a specialist after finding lumps in her breasts, the BBC reported. He also said he was concerned for her mental health and feared she might be on the verge of “a nervous breakdown.”', 'Boris Johnson Accused of Worsening Briton’s Plight in Iran - The New York TimesLONDON — Britain’s foreign secretary faced accusations on Monday of having made a misleading and careless statement about a British citizen of Iranian descent imprisoned in Iran that could prolong her ordeal there.The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, spoke in Parliament last month about Iran’s imprisonment of the woman, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. He described her conviction for sedition as a mockery of justice but also said she had been “simply teaching people journalism.”Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s employer, family and local parliamentary representative said Mr. Johnson’s statement about the activities of Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran not only were untrue but also had created new risks for her.Days after Mr. Johnson’s comments, Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was taken to a new court hearing, where Mr. Johnson’s words were cited as evidence that she had been engaged in “propaganda against the regime.”Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, whose plight in Iran has become something of a cause in Britain, is serving a five-year prison term on charges of seeking to overthrow the government. Her supporters have called the charges absurd.Monique Villa, chief executive officer of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s employer, appealed to Mr. Johnson to correct his statement, adding that the accusation “can only worsen her sentence.”“She is not a journalist and has never trained journalists at the Thomson Reuters Foundation, where she is project manager in my Media Development team,” Ms. Villa said.Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran on vacation, showing her daughter Gabriella to her grandparents, when she was arrested at the Tehran airport on April 3, 2016. Gabriella was placed in the care of her grandparents, but her British passport was confiscated, complicating any effort by her father, Richard Ratcliffe, also a British citizen, to retrieve her from Iran.“I see a direct correlation between this statement by Boris Johnson, who rightly condemned the treatment that Nazanin has received in Iran, and the fact that Nazanin was brought once again into Court on Saturday 4 November and accused of ‘spreading propaganda against the regime,’ ” Ms. Villa said.Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi, the Tehran prosecutor general, said at a news conference in Tehran on Oct. 17 that Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe had worked for the BBC’s Persian Service. The government in Tehran views the BBC with particular hostility.In a statement, the BBC said, “Nazanin has never worked for the BBC Persian Service.”According to the Fars News Agency’s account of the news conference, Mr. Jafari-Dolatabadi said that Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s “husband is a British national, and she has the British citizenship and has worked in this country.”“She used to teach an online journalism course at the Persian section of the BBC, which aimed to recruit and train people for propaganda activities against Iran,” the prosecutor said. “Using anonymous emails, sophisticated and long passwords, saving passwords and encrypting materials and information were the subjects instructed in these courses.”On Monday, the British Foreign Office issued a statement that did not acknowledge that Mr. Johnson had misspoken but said that his comments had provided “no justifiable basis on which to bring any additional charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.”“While criticizing the Iranian case against Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Foreign Secretary sought to explain that even the most extreme set of unproven Iranian allegations against her were insufficient reason for her detention and treatment,” the statement said. It added that Mr. Johnson planned to call his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, “to raise again his serious concerns about the case and ensure his remarks are not misrepresented.”Tulip Siddiq, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party who represents Ms. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s constituency in the British Parliament, voiced her anger over Mr. Johnson’s latest comments.“I’ve repeatedly told Gov and Boris she was on holiday in Iran,” she wrote on Twitter, referring to the British government and Mr. Johnson. “How could he be so careless? This is life or death!”', 'JERUSALEM – A map included in a preliminary agreement that seeks to establish buffer zones in southwest Syria indicates that Iran-backed forces could deploy within several miles (kilometers) of the Israeli frontier.The map of the agreement, reached between the U.S., Russia and Jordan last week, shows the buffer area nearly abutting the town of Quneitra next to the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the map on Wednesday.Israel has long complained about the involvement of archenemy Iran and its proxy Hezbollah in Syria. Officials say Israel is not a party to last week\'s "memorandum of understanding" and will defend its interests.Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Wednesday that Israel maintains the right to "act freely" and will not allow Syria to become a front line.', 'Iran-Iraq Earthquake Kills More Than 500 - The New York TimesTEHRAN — Iranians dug through rubble in a frantic search for survivors on Monday, after a powerful earthquake struck near the Iraqi border, killing more than 500 people and injuring thousands of others in the world’s deadliest earthquake so far this year.The quake, recorded at 9:48 p.m. on Sunday, was felt as far away as Turkey and Pakistan. The epicenter was near Ezgeleh, Iran, about 135 miles northeast of Baghdad, and had a preliminary magnitude of 7.3, according to the United States Geological Survey. Seismologists in the country said it was the biggest quake to hit the western part of Iran.Photographs from the region — a patchwork of farms and home to many Kurds, a large ethnic minority in Iran — posted on the internet showed collapsed buildings, cars destroyed by rubble and people sleeping in the streets in fear of aftershocks.At least 530 people were killed and 7,460 people were injured in Iran, according to the state-run news agency IRNA. At least eight people were killed on the Iraqi side of the border, according to Dr. Saif al-Badir, a spokesman for the Health Ministry, and at least 535 were hurt.In Tehran, hundreds of people waited in line to donate blood in response to a call from the government. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, delivered a message of condolence on Monday, urging rescue workers to keep searching for survivors.“The officials should hasten in these first hours with all their might and determination to help the injured, especially those trapped under the rubble,” his office reported.By the evening, however, Iranian officials said that the rescue mission was nearly over, according to the state news media.Particularly hard hit was Pol-e Zahab, a city in the western Iranian province of Kermanshah, according to the semiofficial Iranian Students News Agency. The authorities said that at least 236 people had died in the city, which has a population of 30,000, and the main hospital was believed to be at least partly running.“My friend was screaming, saying, ‘I lost my home,’ ” one resident wrote on Twitter. “Thank God, she and her family are doing well. She said people were only mourning and their loved ones were under the rubble.”One image from Pol-e Zahab appeared to show the near-destruction of an apartment block recently built for low-income families. Another, posted on the website Khabar Online, showed a pickup truck transporting victims under colorful blankets.Farhad Tarji, a member of Parliament for Pol-e Zahab, told the semiofficial news agency ILNA that his family had been devastated by the quake. “I’ve lost 15 people,” he said.The Iranian government newspaper posted a video on its website in which a resident of Pol-e Zahab complained that no aid had come.“There has been no help yet, neither food nor water, no clothing, no tents, there is nothing,” said the resident, a man who appeared to be in his 30s, while standing in a street with collapsed buildings. “There are no facilities yet. We’ve slept outside since last night. This is the condition of our homes. Our electricity, water, gas, phone lines are out, everything is completely out, the whole city has been destroyed, it is wrecked.”An image posted on social media showed soldiers searching through the rubble at night without flashlights or torches, using their cellphones for light.Officials from the Health Ministry traveled to the area, as did the commander in chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, Brig. Gen. Mohammed Ali Jafari, but foreign reporters were not allowed to visit the scene, in a change from previous disasters.The Iranian Red Crescent used rescue dogs to search for survivors, as it has since an earthquake in the southern city of Bam in 2003 that killed more than 20,000 people. The country’s religious leaders regard dogs as unclean, but the use of guard and rescue dogs is accepted.Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was president of Iran from 2005 to 2013, introduced a program to build low-income housing, including in Pol-e Zahab. After the quake on Sunday, his political opponents said that many of the buildings had been poorly constructed, but his defenders said that the buildings were on fault lines and that nothing could have been done.Initial reports from the Kurdish region of Iraq indicated less damage and fewer deaths on that side of the border. In Sulaimaniya, the second-largest city in Iraq’s Kurdish region, residents described feeling heavy tremors but said there was no notable building damage. Residents in the oil-rich town of Kirkuk, roughly 50 miles to the west, reported similar damage.Ali Namiq, a resident of the town Darbandikhan, Iraq, said a building was flattened by the quake. “The building fell on a seven-member family,” he told Reuters. “We managed to rescue only five out of them, while the two others were killed. It was the first time for me to see an earthquake. It is a divine act that no one can prevent.”In the town of Kalar, Iraq, the quake sent items tumbling from shelves in a supermarket, causing shoppers to flee.The quake occurred about 20 miles south of the Iraqi city of Halabja, where Saddam Hussein’s government launched a poison gas attack that killed more than 5,000 people, mostly Kurds, on March 16, 1988, in the closing days of the Iran-Iraq war.The earthquake was felt as far as the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Shiite pilgrims in the Iraqi city of Karbala, for the annual religious commemoration of Arba’een, posted videos of people gathering on the streets after the earthquake.Iran lies on dozens of fault lines and is prone to quakes. In 2012, a double earthquake in the north of the country killed 300 people. When residents learned of the government’s lackluster relief efforts,  some started organizing aid groups themselves. After that quake, the United States, which does not maintain normal diplomatic relations with Iran, sent several planeloads of aid.', 'Roy Moore, Iran, General Electric: Your Monday Evening Briefing - The New York Times(Want to get this briefing by email?

A fifth woman accused Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate, of sexual misconduct when she was a teenager.Beverly Young Nelson, above left, told a news conference in New York that Mr. Moore attacked her when she was 16 and he was a prosecutor in Etowah County, Ala. She said he warned her back then that “no one will believe you” if she told anyone. Read her full statement here.Republican leaders, including the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, are calling on Mr. Moore to drop out of the race — and some want Attorney General Jeff Sessions to return to his old seat. We collected the best writing from the right and left on the allegations._____2. President Trump said he had a “great relationship” with Rodrigo Duterte, his Philippine counterpart.Human rights issues barely came up during their first face-to-face meeting, though Mr. Duterte stands accused of ordering thousands of extrajudicial killings in his nation’s war on drugs.

Mediation by France, a close ally of both Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, helped reverse the resignation, which Hariri suspended after his return to Beirut.Though Saudi Arabia may have succeeded in pressuring Hezbollah and bringing attention to the Shiite militant group\'s expanding regional footprint, the kingdom\'s political moves in Lebanon were largely seen as a debacle that backfired.The 50-year-old al-Sabhan was at the center of it all.Al-Sabhan\'s first trip to Washington, in March, was with Mohammed bin Salman, who just months later would be named crown prince and heir to the Saudi throne. It was a pivotal visit that would cement Riyadh\'s relationship with the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump.A subsequent trip to Washington earlier this month, however, didn\'t go as well. Days after Hariri\'s resignation, al-Sabhan met with officials from the State Department, Pentagon and the White House National Security Council.Instead of raising support for the resignation, al-Sabhan was given an earful from U.S. officials who chided him and pressed him to stop his provocative tweets, according to Arab media reports and a person privy to the meeting\'s outcome, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn\'t authorized to discuss the encounter. They also asked who gave al-Sabhan the right to undermine Lebanon\'s stability at a time when Washington was backing the Lebanese armed forces and the country was hosting more than a million Syrian refugees.The 32-year-old Saudi crown prince\'s hawkish policies toward Iran are largely embodied and amplified in al-Sabhan. Nowhere is that spelled out more clearly than on Twitter, where al-Sabhan has referred to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah — which means "Party of God" in Arabic — as the "Party of Satan."A few days before Hariri\'s resignation, al-Sabhan warned in an interview with a Lebanese TV station that there would be "astonishing" developments to topple the Shiite militant group in Lebanon. He also said that Lebanon\'s government — headed by Hariri — would be dealt with as a hostile government that\'s declared war against Saudi Arabia because of Hezbollah\'s power-sharing role."It is up to (Lebanon\'s) leaders to decide whether it is a state of terror or peace," al-Sabhan wrote on Twitter two days after Hariri\'s resignation.Al-Sabhan, who as Saudi Arabia\'s military attaché in Lebanon in 2014 and 2015 monitored Hezbollah, was fed information by some Lebanese politicians about the group\'s role in the Syrian civil war, according to a Lebanese man who frequently spoke with al-Sabhan during his time in Beirut.Al-Sabhan would often chat with politicians, journalists and businessmen at a cafe in Beirut\'s upscale Verdun neighborhood, said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations."He is a tightlipped person. He listens more than he talks," the Lebanese man said.After his stint in Lebanon, al-Sabhan was appointed Saudi Arabia\'s first ambassador to Iraq in more than 25 years.But just nine months into the job, Iraq\'s government demanded that al-Sabhan be replaced after he sparked an outcry for alleging the government refused to provide him better protection in the face of what he claimed were plans by Iranian-backed Shiite militia groups to assassinate him. He also called on Iraq\'s government to exclude Shiite paramilitary groups from the military campaign against the Islamic State group.Al-Sabhan was recalled and appointed to his current ministerial post, where he has used Twitter to vocalize the kingdom\'s brash anti-Iran rhetoric.He\'s also been sent on missions far and wide. He was spotted last month in the Syrian city of Raqqa with a U.S. official after the Islamic State group\'s de facto capital was recaptured by Syrian U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led forces.In Saudi Arabia, al-Sabhan has sat in on high-level meetings and welcomed Lebanon\'s Maronite patriarch when he visited the conservative Sunni Muslim country in a first ever such trip. He was also present at the patriarch\'s meeting with King Salman.Al-Sabhan has also sat in on the king\'s meeting with Turkey\'s foreign minister in June, the crown prince\'s meeting in August with prominent Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and meetings with Iraq\'s Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.On Twitter, al-Sabhan has openly tried to call the shots in Lebanon, demanding that Hezbollah be kicked out of the government and calling on the Lebanese to confront the militant group. He even got into a Twitter spat with Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah.In one of the Hezbollah leader\'s speeches, he described al-Sabhan as "zaatout," a derogatory Arabic term that means variously "little monkey with lots of hair" or an "adult who behaves like a child."Al-Sabhan responded with a tweet of his own. "If an incompetent man criticizes me, this is proof that I am a whole man," he wrote.Former Lebanese Cabinet Minister Wiam Wahhab, a Hezbollah ally, described al-Sabhan in a television interview as a "monster on the loose.""I hope that Thamer al-Sabhan paid the price for such militia-style behavior," he said.___Batrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Associated Press writer Josh Lederman in Washington contributed to this report.', 'For Westerners Imprisoned in Iran, New Signs of a Deal - The New York TimesOne American prisoner has lost six teeth from malnutrition. Another tried to kill himself. A third, a Briton, is traumatized by the possibility her sentence could be doubled.They are among the foreign nationals incarcerated in Iran on spying or sedition charges, a continuing source of tension in that country’s relations with Western nations, particularly the United States and Britain. Many are Iranians with dual citizenship.Now, the prisoner issue is heating up as President Trump threatens to derail the nuclear agreement with Iran and possibly revive onerous American sanctions.Nearly two years after a group of American captives in Iran was freed when the nuclear accord took effect — in return for the release of a group of Iranians held in the United States — there is speculation that another prisoner exchange may be sought.The Iranians have been dropping hints recently that they are prepared to make a deal, even as the Trump administration increasingly shows its antipathy to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his subordinates. Like the last deal, this one might involve clearing of old debts owed to Iran from the period before its 1979 revolution.Each side, in effect, has prisoners to use as a bargaining chip.The Iranians say at least 14 Iranians have been unfairly imprisoned or prosecuted by the United States or its allies, mostly on what they call specious accusations of sanctions violations. The list includes a friend of Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, and a pregnant woman held in Australia who could be extradited to the United States.Last week, in what has been widely seen as a way of telegraphing a possible prisoner exchange, Iranian state television broadcast reports on two Western prisoners held in Iran: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, a Briton of Iranian descent employed by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, who was sentenced to five years, and Xiyue Wang, 37, an American of Chinese descent working on his Ph.D. in history at Princeton University, who was sentenced to 10 years.On Tuesday, a State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, condemned the videos and reiterated the American demand for Iran to release all prisoners who are “unjustly detained, in particular American citizens.” She did not answer when asked about the possibility of a dialogue with Iran on the prisoner issue.Hua Qu, Mr. Wang’s wife, said in a telephone interview that she thought the television broadcast was “a step forward,” although she implored the Trump administration to do more to help free her husband and other incarcerated Americans.“They have promised many times it’s their first priority, to bring back our hostages,” Mr. Wang’s wife said. “My husband has been behind bars for 16 months; he has arthritis in both knees, back pain, headaches.”Earlier, in an interview with NBC News, she said her husband was “extremely stressed, he has depression and he attempted to commit suicide.”At least four American citizens and two permanent residents of the United States are known to be held in Iranian prisons. A fifth American, Robert A. Levinson, has been missing in Iran for more than a decade.Besides Mr. Wang, speculation about a possible exchange also has centered on Baquer and Siamak Namazi, a father and son who are each serving 10-year terms.Considerable diplomatic pressure has been exerted on Iran concerning the older Mr. Namazi, a former Unicef diplomat who is about to turn 82 and suffers from a number of maladies, including heart disease.Jared Genser, a lawyer in Washington for the Namazi family, said Tuesday that their conditions of confinement had improved compared with a year ago. That being said, he added, the Iranian government had recently “taken a tougher line,” possibly in connection with the Trump administration’s hostility.“Baquer has lost six teeth from malnutrition,” Mr. Genser said, adding that while his client had been fitted for implants, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which controls the wing of Evin Prison where he is confined, “have refused to allow the implants.”Still, Mr. Genser said, the prison authorities have permitted cardiologists to install a pacemaker in the father — a possibly telling indicator of his worth to them as a bargaining chip.“I hope the government of Iran appreciates that the value that Baquer Namazi might serve is dependent on his being alive — particularly if there was a prisoner swap,” Mr. Genser said. “If he were to die, the consequences would be severe, and no government in the world would defend Iran.”Mr. Wang was arrested last year while researching public records in Iran for his doctoral thesis on an Iranian dynasty that ended last century. He was accused of passing documents to the State Department.Iranian state television’s broadcast about Mr. Wang, on Sunday, showed him wearing a white prisoner uniform while under interrogation. He explains that he visited several archives. “That’s it,” he is heard saying.The authorities have alleged that he illicitly scanned 4,500 pages of digital documents, paid thousands of dollars to access archives he needed and sought access to confidential areas of Tehran’s libraries.Princeton repeatedly has asserted his innocence and said that he had received government permission for his research. In an emailed statement on Monday, Daniel Day, a Princeton spokesman, said the Iranian broadcast had been “filled with false and misleading statements about Mr. Wang and about Princeton.”The television broadcast on Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, last Thursday, included close-ups of an April 2010 pay stub from her previous employer, the BBC World Service Trust. Iran is suspicious of the BBC because it broadcasts a Persian-language satellite television channel that competes with state television.The Iranian broadcast included a June 2010 email, found in her inbox by interrogators from the Revolutionary Guards, in which she wrote about the “ZigZag Academy,” a BBC World Service Trust project, which trained “young aspiring journalists from Iran and Afghanistan through a secure online platform.”Both her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, and Thomson Reuters repeatedly have emphasized that she was not training journalists or involved in any work regarding Iran while there. But their assertions were undermined a few weeks ago when Boris Johnson, Britain’s foreign secretary, told Parliament in an apparent gaffe that Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been “teaching people journalism.”Mr. Johnson, who is scheduled to travel to Iran in the coming month, retracted the remark, but Iranian state television described it as proof of her “crimes.”Mr. Ratcliffe has said his wife is now worried that because of Mr. Johnson’s remarks, her five-year sentence could be increased to 10 years. She has a second trial scheduled on Dec. 10.Iranian and British officials in the past months have hinted there could be a compensation of about $500 million for a decades-old dispute over roughly 1,500 British Chieftain tanks, paid for by Iran but never delivered after the 1979 revolution.Officials from both countries insist Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case is not related to the debt repayment. But on Tuesday, Iran’s Judiciary spokesman, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, seemed to draw a connection.Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been held in Iran since April 2016, could be granted “conditional release” if she qualifies for it, he was quoted as saying by ISNA, the semiofficial student news agency.Asked whether Britain’s payment of its debt to Iran could play a part in the case, Mr. Ejei was quoted as saying that any country would try to secure the release of its citizens imprisoned in another country and that “we would do the same if we have any imprisoned abroad.”', '', 'Ex-leader killed by Iranian-backed rebels during attack in Sanaa.Iran-allied Houthi forces claimed to have killed Yemen\'s powerful ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh on Monday, while Saudi-led fighter jets pounded areas of the country\'s capital in the intensifying and bloody battle for control of the city.The Houthi-run Masirah TV announced the death of the "leader of the traitors," referring to Saleh, who ruled the country for more than three decades, and up until last week was in a fragile alliance with the rebels.A senior official with Yemen\'s internationally-recognized government confirmed to The Associated Press that Saleh had been killed, sending video purportedly showing Saleh\'s body being carried away by a group of armed men chanting, "Allahu akbar."The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn\'t authorized to speak to the press. It was not immediately possible to confirm the authenticity of the video, which was circulating widely on social media.Yemen\'s former President Ali Abdullah Saleh addresses a rally held to mark the 35th anniversary of the establishment of his General People\'s Congress party.(Reuters)Residents in Sanaa told Reuters that Houthi fighters blew up Saleh’s house in the center of the city.Iran\'s FARS News Agency reported Saleh was killed while trying to escape from Sanaaon an armed vehicle, which was hit and destroyed, though that could not be immediately confirmed.Saleh\'s reported killing comes as a climax to the fighting erupted between the Iranian-allied Shiite rebels and forces loyal to Saleh last week. The breakdown of the fragile alliance has caused the Saudi-led coalition to step up its bombing of Houthi positions, in support of Saleh\'s forces, leaving the rebels increasingly isolated after three years of war.The fighting in the capital of Sanaa caused residents to cower in their homes as explosions rocked the city overnight. Residents and medics told Reuters at least 125 were killed in the fighting on Monday, according to Reuters.Suze van Meegen, Sanaa-based protection and advocacy adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the AP the violence left aid workers trapped inside their homes and was "completely paralyzing humanitarian operations.""No one is safe in Sana\'a at the moment. I can hear heavy shelling outside now and know it is too imprecise and too pervasive to guarantee that any of us are safe," she said.The Houthis and forces allied to Saleh swept into the capital, Sanaa, in 2014. The Houthis dominate the northern part of the city, while Saleh\'s forces hold the southern part, with much of the current fighting concentrated around the Political District, home to ministries and foreign embassies. The Houthis appeared to be targeting the homes of Saleh\'s family, political allies and commanders in this most recent round of fighting.In this Jan. 3, 2017 file photo, tribesmen loyal to Houthi rebels chant slogans during a gathering aimed at mobilizing more fighters into battlefronts to fight pro-government forces.(AP)The Saudi-led coalition launched an air campaign against the rebels in March 2015 and later expanded into ground operations. Saudi Arabia views the Houthis as an Iranian proxy on its doorstep, and the rivalry between the two regional powers has amplified the conflict. Iran supports the Houthis but denies arming them.The stalemated war has killed more than 10,000 civilians and displaced 3 million.The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'Why Decertifying the Iran Nuclear Deal Would Be a Bad Idea - The New York TimesPresident Trump is expected to announce next week whether he will withdraw certification of the nuclear deal with Iran that was negotiated by the Obama administration. The Washington Post reported Thursday that he is planning to decertify the deal. The Times editorial board has long argued that is wrong-headed, and will ultimately prove to be a step that antagonizes Iran, a major regional power, and leads to the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world.Here’s why:It ignores that the deal is working. The deal was intended to keep Iran from producing a nuclear weapon, a crucial and necessary goal. Critics ignore the fact that the deal is doing that, as the International Atomic Energy Agency, which rigorously monitors Iran’s activities, and even Mr. Trump’s own State Department have certified.It would alienate our allies and make a bad situation with North Korea even worse. If America withdraws from the agreement, it will outrage the other major powers that are party to the deal — France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China — and give Iran an excuse to resume a full-blown nuclear program. Why Mr. Trump would risk that when North Korea’s program is a full-time concern is a mystery.It sends the wrong message to Iran, and that’s dangerous. As it has been with other foreign policy issues, the Trump administration’s approach to Iran has been full of mixed messages. Yet amid the confusion, there has been an ominous tendency to demonize Iran and misrepresent the threat it presents. This could lead to an unnecessary and risky confrontation.It doesn’t help in the fight against the Islamic State. The fear is that Mr. Trump’s demonizing of Iran, and his unwillingness to engage its government, could result in a broadening of the American military mission from defeating ISIS to preventing Iranian influence from expanding. This would be dangerous. Iran is a vexing state to be smartly managed, not assumed to be an implacable enemy.It ignores the complexity of the region.  In some ways Iran is an easy political target. Sunni Arabs feel threatened by Iran and are competing with Iran for regional influence. Israel detests Iran and so do many members of Congress. Yet to see Iran as implacably hostile is much too simple. Even as Mr. Trump reaffirmed America’s partnership with the conservative Saudi royals, Iranians were re-electing a moderate, Hassan Rouhani, as president and reaffirming their interest in engagement with the West. The Saudi human rights record is no better than Iran’s.It undermines trust in America and the country’s ability to negotiate in the future. At a crucial moment, Donald Trump is forcing the world to confront core questions it really shouldn’t have to ask: Can he be trusted? And, more saliently, can America be trusted? His threats to jettison the Iran nuclear deal are undermining America’s credibility as a negotiating partner and weakening America’s ability to lead the free world as it has for 70 years.', 'At Iran Sanctions Trial: A Star Witness Revealed, and a Sleepy Juror - The New York TimesA trial over a conspiracy to violate United States sanctions with a billion-dollar scheme to smuggle Turkish gold for Iranian oil began in New York this week.The case has riveted Turkey and rattled the Turkish government.Before the trial opened, there was broad speculation that the lead defendant, Reza Zarrab, had entered a plea bargain with the prosecution and would reveal damaging information about corruption and illegal dealings in high places.The other defendant, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Turkish banker, pleaded not guilty before the trial began. Seven others have been charged in the conspiracy but remain at large.Here’s what we’ve learned in the trial’s first week.A month ago, Mr. Zarrab, 34, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, was facing years in prison on charges that he had helped orchestrate the billion-dollar scheme in violation of American sanctions.He put together a team of prominent lawyers, including former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, an informal adviser to President Trump. The legal team vigorously fought the case on his behalf. But this fall, Mr. Zarrab’s lawyers stopped filing legal papers, and he stopped appearing in court, spurring widespread speculation about his status.Had he switched sides to cooperate with the United States government?On Tuesday, Mr. Zarrab gave a stunning answer, appearing as the government’s star witness in the trial of Mr. Attila, the Turkish banker who had been charged with him.Through three days of often-compelling testimony, Mr. Zarrab has appeared composed, has maintained a respectful tone and has rarely looked uncomfortable answering questions. His testimony about how he had carried out the scheme, working with bankers and a government minister, sent political tremors through Turkey.Ever since Mr. Zarrab’s arrest in March 2016, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has repeatedly condemned the prosecution and seemingly tried everything to have the case dismissed.Mr. Erdogan claimed there were “malicious” intentions behind the prosecution, and he raised the case with American officials, including Mr. Trump, in a phone call in September.“We have to seek justice, for he is our citizen,” Mr. Erdogan said of Mr. Zarrab more than a year ago.But in his testimony this past week, Mr. Zarrab all but implicated Mr. Erdogan in the alleged scheme. He testified that Zafer Caglayan, then the economy minister, had told him in 2012 that Mr. Erdogan, who was prime minister at the time, had personally ordered that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in the sanctions-busting activity.Mr. Zarrab also said he had paid Mr. Caglayan tens of millions of dollars in bribes. Mr. Caglayan is one of the seven defendants who remain at large.Turkey has been gripped by the trial, with its cast of rich and powerful characters and its enormous sums: billions of dollars in Iranian oil money and bribes in the tens of millions of dollars, allegedly paid to the former economy minister.The Turkish government tried to head off negative news coverage, denouncing the trial in the days before it began as a plot against the government and against Turkey itself.Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said the evidence had been fabricated by followers of the cleric Fethullah Gulen — who was accused of fomenting last year’s failed coup against Mr. Erdogan — and that a 2013 Turkish police investigation into the matter had been dismissed for that reason. Mr. Gulen lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania.In Turkey’s increasingly authoritarian climate — a state of emergency has been imposed for more than a year — newspapers and television channels have largely followed the government line, describing Mr. Zarrab as a hostage and his decision to cooperate with the United States prosecutors as forced.Television chat shows discussed at length his appearance in tan jail attire on the first day of the trial. Only one newspaper, the independent daily Cumhuriyet, dared lead with the most momentous detail: Mr. Zarrab’s statement that Mr. Erdogan had ordered two banks to be included in the scheme.But social media was abuzz with the case all week, and Turks followed live feeds from reporters and online news outlets covering the trial in English and Turkish.The scale of the bribes that Mr. Zarrab said he paid the former minister drew bitter jokes.“The bribe was 45 or 50 million euros,” one user wrote on Twitter. “I would have to work 11,750 months. That makes nearly a thousand years. 1,000. 1,000!”Burak Acerakis, who campaigns for education for children with Down syndrome, wrote, “With only 2.6 percent of the bribe taken by Caglayan, 36,000 children with Down syndrome would be able to have pre-education therapy for five years.”Not all the testimony has been riveting, or so it seemed for at least one of the 12 jurors hearing the case. Late on Friday, after Judge Richard M. Berman had excused the jury for the weekend, he announced that he was going to dismiss one juror from the case.His offense? Sleeping.“It was my observation,” the judge said, “that one of the jurors in my direct line of sight has been sleeping almost the whole trial.”Judge Berman said that the man “seemed like a very nice fellow,” and he noted that during the jury selection, when he had asked the man what he liked to do in his spare time, the answer was, “Sleep.”“That, maybe, should have told us,” Judge Berman noted.He said he would notify the juror that he had been excused. Several alternate jurors have been selected, and one will move onto the regular panel.Judge Berman made it clear that he believed the issue of staying alert through testimony was an important one.“I just don’t think a juror can perform his duties — him or her — unless they pay attention to what’s going on in the courtroom,” he said, adding, “Today to me was the icing on the cake.”The juror had been “really sound asleep,” Judge Berman added. “Not just dozing.”', 'How the Iranian-Saudi Proxy Struggle Tore Apart the Middle East - The New York TimesBehind much of the Middle East’s chaos — the wars in Syria and Yemen, the political upheaval in Iraq and Lebanon and Bahrain — there is another conflict.Saudi Arabia and Iran are waging a struggle for dominance that has turned much of the Middle East into their battlefield. Rather than fighting directly, they wield and in that way worsen the region’s direst problems: dictatorship, militia violence and religious extremism.The history of their rivalry tracks — and helps to explain — the Middle East’s disintegration, particularly the Sunni-Shiite sectarianism both powers have found useful to cultivate. It is a story in which the United States has been a supporting but constant player, most recently by backing the Saudi war in Yemen, which kills hundreds of civilians. These dynamics, scholars warn, point toward a future of civil wars, divided societies and unstable governments.F. Gregory Gause III, an international relations scholar at Texas A & M University, struggled to name another region that had been torn apart in this way. Central Africa could be similar, he suggested, referring to the two decades of interrelated wars and genocides that, driven by meddling regional powers, killed five million. But in the Middle East, it is just getting started.Saudi Arabia, a young country pieced together only in the 1930s, has built its legitimacy on religion. By promoting its stewardship of the holy sites at Mecca and Medina, it could justify its royal family’s grip on power.Iran’s revolution, in 1979, threatened that legitimacy. Iranians toppled their authoritarian government, installing Islamists who claimed to represent “a revolution for the entire Islamic world,” said Kenneth M. Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.The revolutionaries encouraged all Muslims, especially Saudis, to overthrow their rulers as well.But because Iran is mostly Shiite, they “had the greatest influence with, and tended to reach out to, Shia groups,” Dr. Pollack said.Some Saudi Shiites, who make up about 10 percent of the population, protested in solidarity or even set up offices in Tehran — stoking Saudi fears of internal unrest and separatism.This was the opening shot in the sectarianization of their rivalry, which would encompass the whole region.“The Saudis have looked at Iran as a domestic threat from the get-go, from 1979,” Dr. Gause said. Seeing the threat as intolerable, they began looking for a way to strike back.They found that way the next year, when Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invaded Iran, hoping to seize oil-rich territory.Saudi Arabia, Dr. Pollack said, “backed the Iraqis to the hilt because they want the Iranian revolution stopped.”The war, over eight years of trench warfare and chemical weapons attacks, killed perhaps a million people. It set a pattern of Iranian-Saudi struggle through proxies, and of sucking in the United States, whose policy is to maintain access to the vast oil and gas reserves that lie between the rivals.The conflict’s toll exhausted Iran’s zeal for sowing revolution abroad, but gave it a new mission: to overturn the Saudi-led, American-backed regional order that Tehran saw as an existential threat.That sense of insecurity would later drive Iran’s meddling abroad, said Marc Lynch, a political scientist at George Washington University, and perhaps its missile and nuclear programs.The 1990s provided a pause in the regional rivalry, but also set up the conditions that would allow it to later explode in such force.Saudi Arabia, wishing to contain Iran’s reach to the region’s minority Shiite populations, sought to harden Sunni-Shiite rifts. Government programs promoted “anti-Shia incitement in schools, Islamic universities, and the media,” Toby Matthiesen, an Oxford University scholar, wrote in a brief for the Carnegie Endowment.These policies, Dr. Matthiesen warned, cultivated sectarian fears and sometimes violence that would later feed into the ideology of the Islamic State.In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, a Saudi ally. The United States, after expelling the Iraqis, established military bases in the region to defend its allies from Iraq. This further tilted the regional power balance against Iran, which saw the American forces as a threat.Iraq’s humiliating defeat also spurred many of its citizens to rise up, particularly in poorer communities that happened to be Shiite Arab.In response, Dr. Gause said, “Saddam’s regime became explicitly sectarian,” widening Sunni-Shiite divides to deter future uprisings. That allowed Iran, still worried about Iraq, to cultivate allies among Iraq’s increasingly disenfranchised Shiites, including militias that had risen up.Though it was not obvious at the time, Iraq had become a powder keg, one that would ignite when its government was toppled a decade later.The 2003 American-led invasion, by toppling an Iraqi government that had been hostile to both Saudi Arabia and Iran, upended the region’s power balance.Iran, convinced that the United States and Saudi Arabia would install a pliant Iraqi government — and remembering the horrors they had inflicted on Iran in the 1980s — raced to fill the postwar vacuum. Its leverage with Shiite groups, which are Iraq’s largest demographic group, allowed it to influence Baghdad politics.Iran also wielded Shiite militias to control Iraqi streets and undermine the American-led occupation. But sectarian violence took on its own inevitable momentum, hastening the country’s slide into civil war.Saudi Arabia sought to match Iran’s reach but, after years of oppressing its own Shiite population, struggled to make inroads with those in Iraq.“The problem for the Saudis is that their natural allies in Iraq,” Dr. Gause said, referring to Sunni groups that were increasingly turning to jihadism, “wanted to kill them.”This was the first sign that Saudi Arabia’s strategy for containing Iran, by fostering sectarianism and aligning itself with the region’s Sunni majority, had backfired. As Sunni governments collapsed and Sunni militias turned to jihadism, Riyadh would be left with few reliable proxies.As their competition in Iraq heated up, Saudi Arabia and Iran sought to counterbalance each other through another weak state: Lebanon.Lebanon provided the perfect opening: a frail democracy recovering from civil war, with parties and lingering militias primarily organized by religion.Iran and Saudi Arabia exploited those dynamics, waging a new kind of proxy struggle “not on conventional military battlefields,” Dr. Gause said, but “within the domestic politics of weakened institutional structures.”Iran, for instance, supported Hezbollah, the Shiite militia and political movement, which it had earlier cultivated to use against Israel. Riyadh, in turn, funneled money to political allies such as the Sunni prime minister, Rafik Hariri.By competing along Lebanon’s religious lines, they helped drive the Lebanese government’s frequent breakdowns, as parties relied on foreign backers who wanted to oppose one another more than build a functioning state.With Iran promoting Hezbollah as the nation’s defender and Saudi Arabia backing the Lebanese military, neither had a full mandate, and Lebanon struggled to maintain order.As the foreign powers escalated their antagonism, Lebanon’s dysfunction spiraled into violence. In 2005, after Mr. Hariri called for the withdrawal of Iranian-backed Syrian troops, he was assassinated. (Hezbollah has long been suspected.)Another political crisis, in 2008, culminated with Hezbollah overpowering Sunni militias to seize much of Beirut. Saudi Arabia requested United States air cover, according to a WikiLeaks cable, for a Pan-Arab force to retake the city. Though the intervention never materialized, the episode was a dress rehearsal for the turmoil that would soon come to the wider region.When the Arab Spring toppled governments across the Middle East, many of them Saudi allies, Riyadh feared that Iran would again fill the vacuums. So it rushed to close them, at times with force. It promised billions in aid to Jordan, Yemen, Egypt and others, often urging those governments to crack down.After pro-democracy protesters rose up in Bahrain, a Saudi ally whose Sunni king rules over a majority Shiite population, Saudi Arabia sent 1,200 troops.In Egypt, Saudi Arabia tacitly supported a 2013 military takeover, seeing the military as a more reliable ally than the elected Islamist government it replaced. As Libya fell into civil war, it backed a hard-line general who was driving to consolidate control.Though Iran has little influence in either country, Saudi Arabia’s fear of losing ground to Iran made it fight harder to retain influence wherever it could, analysts believe.Syria, an Iranian ally, reversed the usual dynamic. Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Sunni states steered money and arms to rebels, including Sunni Islamists. Iran intervened in turn, sending officers and later Hezbollah to fight on behalf of Syria’s government, whose leaders mostly follow a sect of Shiism.Their interventions, civil war scholars say, helped lock Syria in the ever-worsening stalemate that has killed over 400,000.The United States has struggled to restore the region’s balance.President Obama has urged Iran and Saudi Arabia “to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,” he told The Atlantic.But Dr. Lynch called this plan for “a self-regulating equilibrium” between the Mideast powers “far-fetched.”The nuclear agreement with Iran, instead of calming Saudi nerves, hit on fears that “the United States wants to abandon them in order to ally with Iran,” Dr. Lynch said, calling the belief “crazy” but widespread.Mr. Pollack said he often heard Sunni Arab leaders express this as a metaphor.“They would say, ‘What is wrong with you people? You have this good, loving, loyal wife in us, and this crazy mistress in Iran. You don’t understand how bad she is for you, and yet you endlessly run off to her the moment that she winks at you,’” he recounted.The White House looked for other ways to reassure Saudi leaders, facilitating arms sales and overlooking Saudi actions in Egypt and Bahrain.Then came Yemen. A rebel group with loose ties to Iran ousted the Saudi-backed president, deepening Riyadh’s fears. Saudi Arabia launched a bombing campaign that inflicted horror on civilians but accomplished little else.The assault receives heavy American support, though the United States has few interests in Yemen other than counterterrorism and sometimes criticizes the campaign. In exchange, Riyadh acquiesced to the Iran deal and began to follow Washington’s lead on Syria. But the underlying proxy war remained.Asked when the Iran-Saudi struggle might cool, Mr. Pollack said he doubted that it would: “Where we’re headed with the Middle East is the current trend extrapolated, with more failed and failing governments.”In Yemen, this is already “reorganizing Yemeni society along sectarian lines and rearranging people’s relationships to one another on a non-nationalist basis,” Farea al-Muslimi, an analyst, wrote in a Carnegie Endowment paper, which cited similar trends across the region.Continued crises will risk sucking in the United States again, Mr. Lynch said, adding that no American president was likely to persuade Saudi Arabia or Iran to stay out of regional conflicts that it saw as potentially existential threats.President-elect Donald J. Trump will enter office having echoed Saudi Arabia’s view of the region.Iran “took over Iraq,” he said at a rally in January. “They’re going to have Yemen. They’re going to have Syria. They’re going to have everything.”Mentioning both the president-elect and Hillary Clinton, Dr. Gause said he doubted that any administration could reset the Middle East’s power struggles.“I do not think that the fundamental problem of the region,” he said, “is something that either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton could do that much about.”', '', 'Aide to Iran’s Nuclear Team Is Imprisoned on Spying Conviction - The New York TimesA Canadian-Iranian accountant who helped advise Iran’s negotiation team in talks that led to the 2015 nuclear agreement with the United States and other big powers has been sentenced to five years in prison for spying.News of the conviction and sentence, reported on Wednesday by Iran’s state-run Tasnim News Agency, did not identify the defendant by name, describing him only as a “spy who had infiltrated the team.”But after news of the arrest first emerged in August 2016, Iranian lawmakers critical of the nuclear agreement identified the defendant as Abdolrasoul Dorri Esfahani, a dual citizen of Canada and Iran.Mr. Esfahani was an adviser to Iran’s central bank and was believed to have helped the country’s nuclear negotiators bargain for the sanctions relief contained in the 2015 nuclear agreement.Canadian news reports have described Mr. Esfahani as an accountant involved in financial aspects of the agreement, which ended or eased many sanctions in return for Iran’s reduced nuclear fuel enrichment and verifiable pledges of peaceful atomic energy use.He was further described in some press accounts as a former diplomat at The Hague who had worked on resolving property disputes between the United States and Iran that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution and the break in relations between the two countries.The Tasnim report said that the defendant had been released on bail after his arrest and conviction by a lower court, but that an appeals court had upheld the ruling, so “the ex-negotiator will be put behind bars for five years on a charge of espionage.”Philip Hannan, a spokesman for Global Affairs Canada, the department that oversees diplomatic matters, said in an emailed response to a request for comment: “Global Affairs Canada is aware of media reports that a dual national has been sentenced in Iran. To protect the privacy of the individual concerned, further details on this cannot be released.”Iran does not recognize dual citizenship for Iranians, which means that Mr. Esfahani’s Canadian passport does not afford him diplomatic protections, such as consular visits, that foreign prisoners receive in Iran. The same issue affects prisoners in Iran who are citizens of the United States and other countries.Precisely what kind of financial information Iranian prosecutors say Mr. Esfahani betrayed — and to whom — is unclear.Iran has been broadly unhappy that the eased sanctions specified in the nuclear agreement have not led to the huge economic boom that the deal’s promoters in Iran had foreseen.Iranian officials have complained that sanctions imposed by the United States that are not covered by the agreement, including longstanding restrictions on banking and financial transactions, have made many companies in other countries wary of investing in Iran.President Trump has denounced the agreement as an “embarrassment” that gave what he views as too many concessions to Iran, and he has hinted that he might withdraw the United States from the pact.Other parties to the accord — Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — as well as some of Mr. Trump’s own key advisers, have urged him to honor it.', "TEHRAN, Iran – The website of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard reports that a pilot has died after his Sukhoi-22 jet fighter-bomber crashed in the country's south.The Saturday report on sepahnews.com said the plane was taking part in a morning exercise in southern Fars province when it crashed. It did not elaborate.Iran has a history of air accidents blamed on its aging aircraft and poor maintenance.Iran has both Russian-made and U.S.-made fighter planes. The U.S. aircraft were delivered to Tehran before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted the western-backed monarchy. Iran purchased Sukhoi fighter-bombers from Russia after the revolution.It also has restored some Sukhoi-22s from Iraq in 1991.", 'TEHRAN, Iran – Iran\'s president is defending the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, saying not even 10 Donald Trumps can roll back its benefits to his country.Hassan Rouhani\'s comments Saturday come as President Donald Trump appears to be stepping back from his campaign pledge to rip up the deal, instead aiming to take other measures against Iran.Addressing students at Tehran University, Rouhani says: "We have achieved benefits that are irreversible. Nobody can roll them back, neither Trump, nor 10 other Trumps."Iran accepted curbs on its contested nuclear program as part of the agreement. In return, Iran has benefited from the lifting of sanctions against Iran\'s oil exports among others.Trump is expected to take new action against Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard and the Iranian backed Shiite militant group Hezbollah.', 'CAIRO – Egypt faces high expectations from Saudi Arabia and its other Gulf Arab benefactors that it will have their back as tensions rise with their rival Iran, including throwing the weight of its military — the largest standing Arab army — into the crisis if needed.But Egypt clearly has no desire to be dragged into a military conflict or to see the tensions spiral into another Saudi-Iran proxy battle like the many that are already tearing up the Middle East.Its reluctance could lead to frictions between Cairo and Riyadh.Egypt\'s leadership has been striking a balancing act, giving nods of support to its Gulf allies while trying to defuse their escalations against Iran.Last week, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi proclaimed that any threat to Gulf security "is a threat to our own national security," warning Iran to stop meddling. But he also said the region "has enough instability and challenges as it is" and doesn\'t need a crisis with Iran or Hezbollah, and he called for dialogue to resolve tensions.Other Egyptian officials sharpened their rhetoric against non-Arab, Shiite Iran, but have not embraced the sectarian or ethnic slant used by their Sunni-led Gulf friends.In the past month, Saudi Arabia has twice accused Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah of acts of war against it. A direct war between the two regional powerhouses still seems unlikely; but the heightened rhetoric raised fears that it wasn\'t out of the question or that a new proxy fight could erupt in Lebanon.Egyptian commentators have bluntly warned against getting mired into a military conflict initiated by the Saudis."Egypt\'s real national duty is to tell our brothers ... that we are with them to defend the security of Saudi Arabia, the Gulf and the entire region ... But that does not mean that we get dragged by them into wars and conflicts that are essentially sectarian and benefit no one except the enemies of the (Arab) nation," the editor of the newspaper Al-Shorouk, Imad Hussein, wrote this week.Hussein, who is close to the government, made sure to praise Saudi Arabia\'s regional role, its financial support for Egypt and its custodianship of Islam\'s holiest shrines. He also avoided naming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the throne behind the kingdom\'s more hawkish anti-Iran stance. He has driven aggressive regional policies, including military intervention in Yemen and the ostracizing of Qatar — a move that Egypt fell in line with.Another prominent commentator, veteran opposition figure Mohammed Aboul-Ghar, counselled the government to stay out of any potential Saudi-Iran conflict, arguing that Egypt\'s army was needed to fight an insurgency by Islamic militants and protect the porous borders."Coming close to that dangerous (Gulf) region is a horrifying prospect. It\'s neither wise nor sound to even talk about that," he wrote in Tuesday\'s edition of the Cairo daily Al-Masry Al-Youm.Saudi Arabia has bolstered el-Sissi with massive financial backing as the general-turned-president struggles to overhaul Egypt\'s dilapidated economy. The kingdom is estimated to have given Egypt more than $10 billion in grants and soft loans since 2013 in addition to numerous free shipments of fuel worth tens of millions of dollars.Still, Egypt has been willing to resist Saudi demands. In 2015, it came under heavy Saudi and Gulf pressure to send ground troops to fight alongside a Saudi-led coalition against Iranian-backed Shiite rebels in Yemen.Instead, Egypt restricted its involvement to deploying warships and aircraft on patrol and reconnaissance missions in the southern reaches of the Red Sea. Egypt has bad memories from its intervention Yemen\'s civil war in the 1960s, when it backed republicans against a Saudi-backed monarchy in an ill-fated and costly military adventure.Egypt has also stayed out of Riyadh\'s campaign to oust President Bashar Assad, supported Russia\'s military intervention there on Assad\'s side and negotiated local cease-fires between the government and rebels.Those differences angered Riyadh, prompting a temporary suspension of aid to Egypt earlier this year.In the end, Saudi Arabia "did not get the foreign policy changes it wanted (from Egypt) in return for its generous support," said Eric Trager of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy."The Saudis have learned to live with limited Egyptian involvement in Yemen," he added.The Saudis and Egypt have somewhat patched up the ill-feelings. Now Cairo wants to avoid a new falling-out over Iran.Tension has been running high between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The kingdom charged that a missile fired by Yemeni rebels toward Riyadh this month could be considered "an act of war" by Iran, which it accused of providing the missile.Things further heated up when Lebanon\'s prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, resigned in a pre-recorded message aired from Saudi Arabia, blaming Hezbollah. Riyadh swiftly criticized Hezbollah, saying its aggressions could be considered a "declaration of war."Still, Egypt seems determined to avert any slide toward armed conflict.El-Sissi dispatched his foreign minister to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Bahrain. In Riyadh, the minister met with the Saudi crown prince and, it appears, counselled backing off an escalation with Iran."The foreign minister was at pains to convey Egypt\'s concern to see the region spared any tensions that would deepen the instability and polarization it\'s already seeing," the minister\'s spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said of the Tuesday meeting.Egypt\'s track record under el-Sissi shows his reluctance toward military action unless its own territory is directly threatened or if the Gulf is subjected to a clear-cut aggression."Egypt adopts a deeply entrenched position against military solutions," presidential spokesman Bassam Rady said in published comments this week.Michael W. Hanna, a Mideast expert at the Century Foundation in New York, said Egypt does have concerns "about what the Iranians are doing in Syria and Yemen.""But Iran is not a high-level priority for Egypt. It does not worry about Iran the same way the Saudis do."', 'QUETTA, Pakistan – A government spokesman says authorities have found the bodies of five more Pakistanis who were apparently planning to cross into Iran on their way to Europe to seek work as migrant laborers.Anwarul Haq Kakar, the spokesman for the Baluchistan government says the bodies were found Saturday in Turbat district, 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) southwest of the city of Quetta.He says apparently the men were part of a group that included 15 men from the Punjab province who were killed earlier this week by a separatist group.The discovery comes a day after the Pakistan army said troops had killed a Baluch separatist commander involved in the slaying of 15 men from Punjab in Baluchistan, where separatist groups have waged a low-level insurgency.', "ISLAMABAD – Pakistan's military says security forces have killed a Baluch separatist commander involved in this week's slaying of 15 men in southwestern Baluchistan province as they were trying to cross into Iran on their way to Europe.The military says the raid was carried out not far away from where the 15 were killed on Wednesday in the Turbat district.

By announcing Friday that the administration would not certify that the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran was in the national interest, Donald Trump has taken a hostage.The hostage is the deal itself. Contrary to belief, decertification neither violates nor cancels the agreement. It does not betray our commitments to our allies and it does not abrogate our obligations to the Iranians. It’s an act of domestic politics between two branches of the United States government.But it’s also a psychological step, a brash signal that Trump is prepared to see the deal fail and accept the consequences, including war, if he can’t negotiate a better one. Since Iran insists it won’t budge, it sets Washington and Tehran on a path of confrontation that can be averted only if one side or the other blinks. Decertification is Trump saying: We won’t blink.On Thursday, a well-placed source who advises the administration on Iran policy and supports decertification listed for me all the ways things could go wrong.There’s personnel risk, starting with the volatility of the man at the top.There’s escalatory risk, as the United States, its forces thinly stretched in the Middle East, become vulnerable to attack by Iran’s terrorist proxies. Think of the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut in 1983 and the humiliating American withdrawal in its wake.There’s diplomatic risk, as Iran traps Western diplomats in a process of never-ending negotiations designed to go nowhere — all the while turning the Islamic Republic into a reputable member of the international community and the United States into the global pariah.Above all, there’s the risk that Iran will call Trump’s bluff, much as Bashar al-Assad called President Obama’s when he failed to enforce his chemical red line in 2013. A superpower repeatedly exposed as a paper tiger by lesser, if more willful, adversaries will not maintain its pre-eminence for long.So what’s the case for supporting decertification?The architects of the nuclear deal make three dubious claims on its behalf. They say it concerns Iran’s nuclear dossier alone, and does not prevent us from thwarting Tehran’s regional bids in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza or the Gulf. They claim the deal is working because Iran is abiding by its terms, as certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.And they add that since the agreement permanently enjoins the Iranians from acquiring nuclear weapons, the United States maintains the military option to stop them from doing so.Yet Iran’s regional behavior has become worse since the nuclear deal came into effect, not least because it provided the regime with a huge new income stream — $10 billion in cash and gold in 2016 alone, plus more than $100 billion in additional sanctions relief — to fund its work. Tehran also operates on the assumption, well justified during the Obama years, that the United States would not risk the nuclear deal for the sake of rolling back Iranian gains in Syria and elsewhere.As for the point that the Iranians are generally (if not quite entirely) honoring their end of the bargain — why shouldn’t they? “Iran doesn’t want a bomb today,” one senior Israeli official told me. “It wants a bomb tomorrow.” That is, it wants a robust nuclear base that puts it within a screw’s twist of a sizable nuclear arsenal without the economic and security risks of actual possession.And if it does choose to go for a bomb once the agreement has run its course, our military options will be slight. If we couldn’t prevent Pakistan or North Korea from going nuclear in the 1990s, why should we think we’ll be able to stop Iran in the nick of time?My critics will claim that a distant prospect of a nuclear Iran is still vastly preferable to an exit from the deal that allows Iran to bring its centrifuges out of storage and start spinning its way to a bomb once again, this time without the monitoring of United Nations inspectors.Maybe. But Iran still wants the economic benefits of the deal — benefits Washington alone can bestow through waivers, permits, relief from secondary sanctions and control over dollar transactions. The American Goliath needn’t be helpless against a Middle Eastern state with a gross domestic product only slightly larger than that of metropolitan Atlanta.We are living through a nuclear nightmare on the Korean Peninsula after more than two decades of optimistic diplomacy. That’s a fate we ought to do everything possible to avoid with Iran. As Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies points out, “decertification isn’t a sufficient condition to break the paralysis of our Iran policy, but it is a necessary one.”Even if the rest of the difficult enterprise rests in the hands of — God help us — President Trump.', 'GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip – The Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group in Gaza, says five of its members who have been missing since Israel demolished a militant tunnel dug from Gaza into Israel this week have died.The group said on Friday the militants\' remains are on the Israeli side of the tunnel after searching for them on the Palestinian side.It vowed revenge "at a suitable time."

Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis argued that it was in the national security interests of the United States to keep the deal’s constraints on Iran. The two men succeeded, over time, in persuading Mr. Trump not to immediately scrap the accord, despite his campaign promise to do so.Mr. Trump, in declaring his intention not to certify Iran’s compliance with the deal, essentially kicked to Congress a decision about whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran and blow up the agreement. His aides, however, insisted that was not the goal, and that they instead wanted Congress to enact legislation defining what would incite the United States to reimpose sanctions.The president listed three such triggers — the deployment of an intercontinental ballistic missile by Iran, Iran’s refusal to negotiate an extension of the deal’s existing constraint on its nuclear activities and evidence that Iran could manufacture a bomb in less than 12 months. Any of those could prompt the United States to walk away from the deal.“In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies,” he said, “then the agreement will be terminated.”Persuading the allies to renegotiate the deal is a far-fetched goal. The leaders of Britain, France and Germany quickly issued a joint statement urging the United States to adhere to the agreement, which they hailed as “the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy.” Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said his country would consider “no amendment whatsoever” to the deal.And enacting new legislation on Iran would require 60 votes in the Senate, meaning Republicans would need to pick up the support of at least eight Democrats. Senate Democrats had urged Mr. Trump not to withhold certification, and they are unlikely to agree to legislation without assurances that the deal will remain intact.Mr. Trump’s scalding critique of the nuclear deal as “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into” echoed the language he used during his presidential campaign. But he also acknowledged the obstacles to ripping it up.“What’s done is done,” Mr. Trump said, “and that’s why we are where we are.”The president seemed determined to erase any residual hope that the nuclear deal might form the basis of a new relationship between the United States and Iran. His speech, from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, was perhaps the most hostile of any American leader toward Iran since President George W. Bush placed the country on his “axis of evil” in 2002.Mr. Trump recited a litany of misdeeds by Iran going back to the 1979 hostage crisis and described it as the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, supporting Al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah and the Taliban. He also accused the country of dealing with North Korea, a reference to Pyongyang’s long history of selling missile technology to Iran, and said he had asked the nation’s intelligence agencies to investigate whether the relationship went further.His tone made clear that Mr. Trump has no interest in what, for the Obama administration, was the biggest gamble of the accord: to provide the basis for two longtime adversaries to find other ways to cooperate. He also suggested that Iran would never change.“Given the regime’s murderous past and present, we should not take lightly its sinister vision for the future,” the president said. “The regime’s two favorite chants are ‘Death to America’ and ‘Death to Israel.’”The nuclear deal is the latest international agreement that Mr. Trump has tried to exit, amend or water down, including the Paris climate accord and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The closest analogy to this deal may be Nafta, the trade agreement that Mr. Trump once threatened to rip up and is now undergoing a painstaking renegotiation.Critics said Mr. Trump risked isolating the United States diplomatically and giving up the deal’s hard-won gains, including intrusive inspections of Iran’s nuclear facilities. The angriest voice belonged to former Secretary of State John Kerry, who spent several years negotiating the accord that Mr. Trump denounced.“It is very, very poor, nonstrategic diplomacy,” Mr. Kerry said in an interview, his voice rising. Pointing out that “you cannot unilaterally reset the terms of the deal,” he said the agreement “gives us a quarter-century of absolute accountability” and assured that “the minute we see the stockpile going up, the questions and red flags will go up like crazy. And 15 or 25 years from now, we still have the same military options we have today.”“If you want to have your war, Donald Trump,” Mr. Kerry said, “you can have it in 20 years.”Congress is deeply divided on the Iran deal, and getting it to agree on additional legislation could prove difficult. While some Republicans are eager to undermine the deal, Democrats are equally determined to preserve what they view as another legacy of the Obama administration that Mr. Trump is trying to dismantle.“We will not buy into the false premise that it is Congress’s role to legislate solutions to problems of his own making,” said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the committee, released a potential blueprint for imposing an automatic return of sanctions if Iran was believed to be capable of producing a nuclear weapon within a year, or if it violated other restrictions.He worked on the proposal with White House officials and Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican who is a hard-liner on Iran, and predicted it could win bipartisan support. It suggests that Mr. Corker’s bitter personal feud with Mr. Trump will not obstruct cooperation on this issue.Mr. Corker, acknowledging he had little choice but to “deal the circumstances as they are,” signaled that he would work to try to find points of compromise — possibly including assurance that the deal would not simply be ripped up by the president. “You’re going to see all of this evolve in daylight,” he told reporters.Decertification does not, by itself, affect the American obligation to adhere to the deal, including the lifting of some economic sanctions.Since becoming president, Mr. Trump has twice reluctantly certified the agreement. But administration officials concluded that he could not bring himself to do that every 90 days, even if the judgment of nuclear inspectors and his own intelligence agencies was that Iran was in compliance.So they tried to find a solution that would allow Mr. Trump to signal his disapproval of the deal without putting the United States in the position of being the first signatory to violate it. That solution was to declare that the suspension of sanctions was not “appropriate and proportionate” to the steps that Iran has taken to end its illicit nuclear activities.That formulation is narrower than declaring that the agreement is no longer in the nation’s national security interests, and administration officials said it was chosen carefully to avoid putting Mr. Trump in a box the next time he had to decide whether to waive sanctions against Iran.While Mr. Trump’s speech was described beforehand by his aides as a description of a broad new initiative to push back on Iran, he gave little description of what that would be. Mr. Trump did say the United States would increase pressure on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which he described as the “supreme leader’s corrupt personal terror force and militia.”The Treasury Department announced it would designate the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group, expanding an existing designation of the Quds Force, the corps’ paramilitary wing. But Mr. Trump stopped short of putting it on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations.Such a designation, Mr. Tillerson said, would impede military operations in which American and Iranian forces found themselves on the same battlefield — presumably fighting the Islamic State.', '', 'Rouhani Lashes Back at Trump, as Iran Unveils New Missile - The New York TimesEscalating a war of words with the United States, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran declared on Friday that his country would continue to develop new missiles and “would not seek anyone’s permission to defend our land.”As he spoke at a military parade in Tehran, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps unveiled a ballistic missile with a range of about 1,250 miles, making it capable of reaching much of the Middle East, including Israel.Mr. Rouhani’s nationally televised speech at the parade — which commemorated the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-88 — and the show of force were a direct display of defiance toward President Trump, who signed a bill in August imposing mandatory penalties on those involved in Iran’s ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them.Although United Nations provisions seek to limit ballistic missile technology, the nuclear agreement negotiated in 2015 by Iran and six world powers, including the United States, does not prohibit Iran from developing such weapons.The Trump administration has called the omission of ballistic missiles a central flaw of the agreement, which Mr. Trump may try to revisit — or scrap altogether, as he has threatened in the past.At the annual United Nations gathering in New York this week, Mr. Trump called the nuclear deal “an embarrassment to the United States,” and Mr. Rouhani retorted, in his own address: “It will be a great pity if this agreement were to be destroyed by ‘rogue’ newcomers to the world of politics.”Upon his return from New York, Mr. Rouhani strongly defended Iran’s right to self-defense.“We will increase our military power as a deterrent,” he said. “We will strengthen our missile capabilities. We will not seek anyone’s permission to defend our land. Not only will we fortify our missiles, but our ground, navy and air forces will always be supported by the people.”The unveiling of the new missile, called the Khoramshahr, comes two months after Iran launched a missile into space, prompting a new round of sanctions and criticism from the United States.“Rouhani is playing hardball,” said Sanam Vakil, an Iran scholar at Chatham House, a think tank in London, and at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. “By promising to step up Iran’s ballistic missile program, Rouhani seeks to gain support from Iranian hard-liners who have long been critical of the nuclear deal, and who have repeatedly accused him of being soft in international relations. Moreover, hard-liners, such as Iran’s supreme leader, believe compromise with the United States is a futile exercise.”She added: “History and the experience of other rogue states such as North Korea has also shown the Iranian government that it is only from a position of strength that regimes such as Iran’s can be protected.”In his remarks, Mr. Rouhani said that Iran was ready to “defend the innocent people of Yemen, Syria and Palestine,” and would "strengthen our defensive and military power as much as we deem necessary for deterrence.”The state-run news agency IRNA quoted the chief of the Revolutionary Guards’ airspace division, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, as saying that the new missile “can carry several warheads for various uses.” The agency did not provide further information on the missile.Mr. Rouhani, a moderate, has staked his reputation on sealing the nuclear deal and relieving the Iranian economy of debilitating international sanctions. In a rejoinder to Mr. Trump’s call to renegotiate the nuclear deal, he said that “all countries” at the General Assembly meeting supported the nuclear deal, “except the United States and the Zionist regime,” a reference to Israel.“Like North Korea, Iran is responding to Trump’s bellicosity by its own display of strength, to show it is not cowed,” said Mark Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Americas office of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think tank.He cautioned that Iran’s claim that the new missile could carry multiple warheads “needs to be taken with a grain of salt,” adding that he “may mean nothing more than multiple cluster bombs,” not the kind of ballistic missile payload — multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle, or MIRV — associated with nuclear missiles.Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, has said that the Iran nuclear agreement must be changed or the United States would not stick with it. Iran has said the accord is not up for renegotiation.The possibility that Washington might renege on the deal has worried some countries, especially as the world grapples with North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile development.This week, Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China said that tensions on the Korean Peninsula highlighted the importance of the Iranian deal, and Foreign Minister Sergey V.

John Bolton offers insight on President Trump\'s upcoming decision.ROME – The head of Iran\'s nuclear agency warned the United States on Tuesday against undermining the 2015 nuclear deal, saying international nonproliferation efforts as well as Washington\'s international standing would suffer as a result.Iranian nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi told an international conference on enhancing nuclear safety that Washington\'s recent "delusionary negative postures do not augur well" for keeping the deal intact.He said Iran didn\'t want to see the deal unravel but that "much more is at stake for the entire international community than the national interests of Iran."U.S. President Donald Trump is set to deliver a speech on Iran this week in which he is expected to decline to certify Iran\'s compliance in the landmark 2015 agreement, referring it to Congress, and perhaps targeting the country\'s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard with new sanctions.Salehi praised the progress that had been made since the 2015 deal, saying nonproliferation and disarmament efforts had benefited worldwide. He called it "simply too precious to be allowed to be undermined or weakened.""The failure of the nuclear deal will undermine the political credibility and international stature of the U.S. in this tumultuous political environment," Salhehi warned.He concluded that he hoped "common sense shall prevail."The U.S. administration has faced two 90-day certification deadlines to state whether Iran is meeting the conditions needed to continue enjoying sanctions relief under the deal and has both times backed away from a showdown. But Trump more recently has said he does not expect to certify Iran\'s compliance with the October deadline looming.On Monday, the European Union\'s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, praised the 2015 deal as a "win-win" solution that was working."We settled a milestone for nonproliferation and we prevented a dangerous devastating military escalation," she told the conference via video message, adding that the International Atomic Energy Agency had certified Iran\'s compliance with the deal, including via inspections, eight times since it was signed.She warned that with rising nuclear tensions on the Korean peninsula, "We have an interest and a responsibility and a duty to preserve the nuclear deal with Iran" and strengthening, not weakening the nonproliferation regime.___This story has been corrected to give the word in Salehi\'s quote as "delusionary" instead of "illusory', '', 'Iran, California, Harvey Weinstein: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The New York Times(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. President Trump made good on his long-running threat to disavow the Iran nuclear deal.In a fiery speech, he announced that he would not certify Iran’s compliance. That kicks the matter to Congress to decide whether to reimpose sanctions, which could threaten the agreement.In this video, our national security correspondent explains why the president hates the deal. European leaders condemned the decision, and Iran’s president, above, called Mr. Trump’s comments “nothing but abuse and threats against the people of Iran.”_____2. Congress is also facing new pressure on health care, after President Trump’s decision to cut off subsidies to insurance companies that help defray costs for low-income people. That could cause premiums to rise.Our resident expert on the Affordable Care Act says that the move could end up costing the government more in the long run.On Thursday evening, we hosted a TimesTalk with our executive editor and two White House correspondents, about how we cover the Trump administration. Here are seven takeaways from the talk, and you can watch the full video here._____3. Air quality is at “unhealthy” levels across much of Northern California as some of the worst wildfires in the state’s history continue to burn.The death toll is at 32, and a burnt smell is inescapable. For fire victims, it was hesitation that was lethal. Many were trapped in cars and basements as fast-moving flames bore down._____4. The Las Vegas police revised the timeline of the Mandalay Bay attack, saying that Stephen Paddock shot at a security guard on his hotel floor at about the same time he began to spray bullets on the crowd below.Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said he was “absolutely offended” at allegations of incompetence over the revised chronology, saying it was the result of the vast scope of the investigation.And our reporters delved into the story of Mr. Paddock’s father, Benjamin Paddock, above, a serial bank robber who was described as having “a sociopathic personality.”_____5. The 54-member board of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will meet in Beverly Hills on Saturday to discuss what to do about Harvey Weinstein.In the wake of the revelations of sexual harassment and rape allegations against him going back decades, the academy could choose to revoke his membership or nullify the Oscar he won in 1999, for “Shakespeare in Love.”The police in London and New York are looking into accusations against him. And top names in fashion, like Anna Wintour, above with Mr. Weinstein in 2010, are speaking out: She called his behavior “appalling and unacceptable.”We collected the best writing from the right and left on the Weinstein case._____6. The N.C.A.A. will not penalize the University of North Carolina over what is considered the worst academic scandal in college sports history.The case, involving fake classes that U.N.C. Chapel Hill athletes were steered into over two decades, did not technically break any rules — because other students had access to them, too.That was the rationale from the N.C.A.A., which also said it had limited power to determine what constitutes academic fraud. The university says it has corrected the “irregularities.” Above, its head basketball coach, Roy Williams, during the Final Four._____7. For generations, millions of Indians have celebrated Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, by setting off a symphony of fireworks.But they’ve been banned in the capital this year over concerns about poisonous air quality. (After last year’s celebrations, a thick haze stayed over New Delhi for 10 days, forcing officials to close elementary schools.)Angry vendors say sales will simply be forced underground. The festival takes place on Thursday._____8. No matter how you raise a wolf, you can’t turn it into a dog. To figure out exactly why that is, scientists are spending a lot of time cuddling and testing wolf puppies.The animals are very similar — some scientists say they’re the same species — but with important genetic differences that researchers are trying to understand. Our reporter went to see the research firsthand.“You have to be with them 24/7. That means sleeping with them, feeding them every four hours on the bottle, ” explained one evolutionary biologist._____9. The truth is unavoidable: The Cubs are no longer the lovable losers of Major League Baseball.That became clear with their victory on Thursday over the Nationals in Game 5 of their National League division series. It was another close one — just like when they defeated Cleveland last November to clinch the World Series.So our baseball writer had to ask: Who’s the new worst team? The jury is out._____10. Finally, we’ve heard a lot lately about “dad jokes.” (Full disclosure, not all of it flattering.) Now, our TV writer says, “mom comedy” is the genre on the verge of a breakthrough.Ali Wong, above, who shot her last special while seven months pregnant, has been touring a new show about motherhood.

He arrived in Riyadh on Saturday and planned to visit Qatar on Monday.The effort to wean Iraq from Iran and bond it to Saudi Arabia isn\'t new, but U.S. officials are optimistically pointing to a surer footing they believe they\'ve seen in recent months. They\'re hoping to push the improved relations into a more advanced phase Sunday when Tillerson participates in the inaugural meeting of the Saudi Arabia-Iraq Coordination Committee in Riyadh.Tillerson will seek Saudi financial generosity and political support for Iraq, its embattled northern neighbor. Two U.S. officials said Tillerson hopes the oil-rich Saudis will contribute to the massive reconstruction projects needed to restore pre-IS life in Iraqi cities such as Mosul and lend their backing to Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. He is treading delicately among a host of powerful countries on Iraq\'s borders which are increasingly trying to shape the future of the ethnically and religiously divided nation.The officials briefed reporters on condition of anonymity because they weren\'t authorized to publicly preview Tillerson\'s plans.Shiite-majority Iraq and Sunni-led Saudi Arabia, estranged for decades after Saddam Hussein\'s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, have tried in recent years to bridge their differences.Nevertheless, the relationship is still plagued by suspicion.Saudi Arabia reopened its embassy in Baghdad in 2015 after a quarter-century, and earlier this year unblocked long-closed border crossings. But the emergence of arch-Saudi rival Iran as a power player in Iraq continues to gnaw at Riyadh and Washington.Iran\'s reported intervention in Iraq\'s semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region, following last month\'s much criticized vote for independence in a referendum, has deepened the unease.President Donald Trump wants to see "a stable Iraq, but a stable Iraq that is not aligned with Iran," H.R. McMaster, his national security adviser, said this past week. He suggested Saudi Arabia could play a pivotal role.The U.S. view is that the alternative may mean more conflict in Iraq, which endured years of insurgency after the U.S.-led 2003 invasion and ethnic warfare when the Islamic State group rampaged across the country in 2014."Iran is very good at pitting communities against each other," McMaster said Thursday at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "This is something they share with groups like ISIS, with al-Qaida. They pit communities against each other because they use tribal and ethnic and sectarian conflicts to gain influence by portraying themselves as a patron or protector of one of the parties in the conflict and then they use that invitation to come in and to help to advance their agenda and, in Iran\'s case, I think is a hegemonic design."Trump and his national security team have framed much of the Middle East security agenda around counteracting Iran, which they see as a malign influence that poses an existential threat to Israel and other American allies and partners in the region. They also accuse Iran of menacing the United States and its interests at home and elsewhere in the world.Shortly after taking office, Tillerson identified improving Saudi-Iraqi ties as a priority in the administration\'s broader policy to confront and contain Iran. Officials say he has devoted himself to the effort.On his second official trip abroad, Tillerson in February canceled a planned "meet and greet" with staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City to focus on the matter, according to one of the officials who previewed Tillerson\'s current trip.Tillerson\'s decision to skip that gathering was widely criticized at the time as a sign of disengagement with his employees, but the official said Tillerson adjusted plans to speak by secure telephone to Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on the Iraq rapprochement.Tillerson, according to the official, implored al-Jubeir to visit Baghdad as a sign of Saudi goodwill and commitment to the effort to defeat IS, which then still held about half of Mosul.Al-Jubeir agreed. Two days later, he made a surprise trip to the Iraqi capital. He was the first Saudi foreign minister to do so in 27 years.', 'Iranian News Media on Trump: ‘He Just Whined’ - Video - NYTimes.com', '', 'JERUSALEM – If President Donald Trump moves to scuttle the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, Israel\'s nationalist government can be expected to be the loudest — and perhaps only — major player to applaud.But the true picture is more complicated than what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might portray: There is a strong sense among his own security establishment that there are few good alternatives, that the deal has benefited Israel, and that U.S. credibility could be squandered in the turbulent Middle East in ways that could harm Israel itself.That is not to say that Israel\'s respected security chiefs are all pleased with every aspect of the Iran deal. But after Netanyahu declared at the United Nations last month that it was time to "fix it or nix it," the prevailing attitude among security officials seems to be that fixing it is the best way to go."It seems to me that the less risky approach is to build on the existing agreement, among other reasons because it does set concrete limitations on the Iranians," said Uzi Arad, a former national security adviser to Netanyahu. "It imposes ceilings and benchmarks and verification systems that you do not want to lose. Why lose it?"Israel considers Iran to be its greatest foe, citing its decades of hostile rhetoric, support for anti-Israel militant groups and its development of long-range missiles. Israeli decision-makers see a nuclear-armed Iran as an existential threat.With Iran believed to be rapidly closing in on developing nuclear weapons, then-President Barack Obama led a coalition of world powers, including Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China, to the nuclear agreement in 2015. The deal offered Iran relief from crippling economic sanctions in exchange for strict limits on its nuclear program.As the deal was being finalized, Netanyahu frantically tried to block it, claiming it did not go far enough. Among his concerns: clauses that will lift the restrictions on Iran next decade, quick relief from sanctions, an imperfect system of inspections and the failure to address Iran\'s other belligerent behavior such as missile tests and involvement in regional conflicts. Netanyahu\'s opposition was so intense that he delivered a speech to the U.S. Congress railing against the emerging deal in early 2015, setting off a crisis in relations with Obama that never healed.On the campaign trail last year, Trump frequently criticized the Iran deal and vowed to rip it up if he was elected. In his own speech to the U.N. last month, Trump called it "one of the worst and most one-sided transactions" in U.S. history. Netanyahu said he had never heard a "bolder or more courageous speech" at the U.N.Following up on his U.N. performance, Trump is scheduled to deliver a speech Thursday in which he is expected to "decertify" the nuclear deal by claiming that Iran has not upheld the spirit of the agreement.This would not immediately pull the U.S. out of the deal. Instead, it would kick it over to Congress, which will then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. If that happens, Iran has threatened to walk away.Most of Trump\'s top national security aides do not want to dismantle the nuclear deal, and America\'s European allies have also urged the Trump administration not to walk away.Netanyahu\'s office said he discussed the matter of decertification with Trump when they met last month, but gave no further details. But he is likely to praise any move toward scrapping the nuclear deal.In an opinion column published in The New York Times last week, Michael Oren, Netanyahu\'s former ambassador to Washington and now a deputy minister for diplomacy, argued that decertification would not be the disaster that critics have predicted.He said if the deal is ultimately canceled, it should be replaced by "crippling sanctions." If retained, he said it should be improved to include stricter inspections of suspect nuclear sites, harsh penalties for violations, and eliminating the "sunset clause" that will gradually end the deal."Either way, revisiting the agreement will send an unequivocal message to the world," Oren said. "It will say that the United States is truly unwilling to accept a nuclear Iran — not now, not in a decade, not ever."As Trump\'s decision nears, however, a number of prominent security experts in Israel are publicly and privately advocating that the deal be left intact and its shortcomings addressed separately.These experts say that the U.S., in consultation with Israel, should work with its allies to engage Iran on their many concerns. Simply walking away would hurt American credibility and put it at odds not only with Iran, but with its partners who remain committed to the deal."You cannot reverse that easily without paying a price," said Arad, Netanyahu\'s former security adviser. "It would simply be a suboptimal and riskier route to go. So I say build on it, reinforce it, enforce it and address other issues without causing kind of self-inflicted losses in the process."Arad said that while there is a healthy debate over how to move forward, he believes that based on his discussions with both retired and active security officials, the prevailing view among experts on the issue is that the deal should be preserved.Top military officials, for instance, say that Iran has scrupulously upheld its commitments in the deal. This calm on the nuclear front has allowed them to focus on their other concerns about Iranian behavior, most critically its involvement in neighboring Syria and its support for the powerful Lebanese militant group Hezbollah."The Iran deal is a deal that contains both problems and shortcomings, but its advantages outweigh the weaknesses by far," said Efraim Halevy, a former director of the Mossad intelligence service.Yaakov Amidror, another former national security adviser to Netanyahu, said he did not think that scrapping the deal is even possible, given the position of America\'s partners. "What should be done is to enhance it. Make it a much better agreement," he said.Yoel Guzansky, a former Iran specialist on the Israeli National Security Council, said that sending the deal to Congress is a "hasty" decision that could backfire.He said the best way to gain leverage over Iran and alter its behavior is through concerted international action. Working together, he said, the international community could pursue various options, including diplomacy, a U.N. resolution or even threatening military action."We need to build an international coalition, which we lack right now. No one except Trump and Netanyahu, with all due respect, is supporting this move right now," said Guzansky, a senior fellow at INSS, a prominent Israeli think tank. "I really hope the two gentlemen have a program."Chemi Shalev, a columnist with the Haaretz daily, said Netanyahu was playing with fire by pushing Washington to break an agreement."Washington\'s signature on any accord will be significantly devalued, and its demands for new agreements with Iran, North Korea or for Middle East peace would henceforth be greeted with polite mockery," he said.Dan Shapiro, who served as Obama\'s ambassador to Israel when the deal was negotiated, said the lack of alternatives and the uncertainty that canceling the deal would bring are causes of great concern to the Israeli security establishment."They don\'t know what will happen if the deal unravels, but it\'s much more likely that they\'re going to be faced with their decision point on Iranian nuclear capability much sooner without the deal than with it," he said.___Associated Press writer Ian Deitch in Jerusalem contributed.', "President Trump slams the agreement at the United Nations, calls it 'the worst'As President Donald Trump considers whether to certify to Congress the controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, word that the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog can’t verify a crucial part of the agreement could tip the scales with time running out by the middle of next month.U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley indicated Thursday that Russia was shielding Iran by blocking the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from verifying part of the deal. The IAEA initially revealed the news to a reporter in a Q&A. Meanwhile, under a requirement from Congress, Trump must choose whether to certify the deal by October 15.Yukiya Amano, the IAEA Director General, told Reuters that his agency’s “tools are limited,” regarding verification of section T in the nuclear deal.Section T of the Iran nuclear deal, which is also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), prohibits activities related to “design and development” of a nuclear weapon.Amano told Reuters that the Russians don’t believe the IAEA has a mandate for that particular section of the agreement.In response to his admission, Haley, not referring to Russia by name in her statement, said that for the deal to have meaning, “the parties must have a common understanding of its terms.”“Now it appears that some countries are attempting to shield Iran from even more inspections. Without inspections, the Iran deal is an empty promise,” she said in the statement released Thursday.The United States Mission to the U.N. when asked for further comment on Haley’s views on certification and on whether the deal is failing because of Iranian noncompliance referred Fox News to Haley’s latest statement and a speech she made to the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) in Washington, D.C. in September.Haley’s AEI speech was broadly interpreted as laying out the administration’s case for not certifying the Iran Nuclear deal.Congress requires the president to certify the Iran deal every 90 days under the terms of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) — also known as the Corker-Cardin bill — that was passed in 2015, paving the way for the Iran nuclear deal, a cornerstone of the Obama administration’s foreign policy legacy.David Albright, who has advised the IAEA in the past, is the founder and president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington D.C. He told Fox News that Russia’s not wanting to let the IAEA verify section T could be problematic.“Amano basically said that the IAEA is not implementing the verification of section T and is unsure how to proceed. He wants guidance from the Joint Commission. However, Russia has said it does not want the IAEA to verify section T. If it sticks to that position in the Joint Commission and blocks instructions to the IAEA to proceed with verifying Section T, and the IAEA does not act on its own to verify Section T or find a work around, then the verification of the JCPOA is incomplete and the deal is not fully implemented,” he said.“Full implementation is a requirement for the President to certify under INARA (Corker-Cardin). Lack of verification of Section T would also demonstrate that the deal does not deliver like promised and promoted by deal supporters,” Albright told Fox News.Omri Ceren, a veteran Middle East expert and a leading critic of the Iran deal, said the IAEA’s inability to verify this part of it should make the president’s decision on certification simple.“There’s no wiggle room here. The law requires the president to tell Congress yes or no, do we know if Iran has ‘fully implemented’ the deal? The U.N.’s nuclear watchdog just said they don’t know if Iran has implemented the section of the deal about nuclear weapons’ work, because Iran won’t let them into military bases where that work is likely to occur. Advocates of the Iran deal are saying the president should certify anyway. They’re asking him to lie to Congress on behalf of the deal,” Ceren said.Trump recently hinted that he might not certify when the 90 days is up on October 15. Since taking office he has twice certified the deal as required by Congress.Ben Evansky reports for Fox Newson the United Nations and international affairs.He can befollowed@BenEvansky", '', 'DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – Iran says it has foiled an online plot led by foreigners to spark dissent involving the tomb of Cyrus the Great on the day that many mark the birth of the Persian king by gathering at his grave.The Iranian judiciary\'s news agency Mizan reported Sunday that the Intelligence Ministry disrupted plans for an "illegal gathering" in Pasargad, some 800 kilometers (500 miles) south of Tehran.Roads to the area have been shut down over what authorities earlier described as an ongoing construction project.

Security Council plus Germany.This recertification is not required by the agreement itself, which holds the International Atomic Energy Agency as the sole authority for verifying Iran’s compliance. The United States Congress introduced the idea of the White House certification in 2015. In short, it is a domestic American issue, though one that could potentially affect implementation of American commitments under the nuclear deal.The Trump administration has certified Iran’s compliance twice before: in April and in July. After hundreds of inspections, the I.A.E.A. has produced eight reports confirming that we are meeting our obligations under the agreement. The countries of Europe, too, are unconcerned. Nonetheless, with Oct. 15 approaching, it is being reported that President Trump will refuse to recertify Iran’s compliance — a move that could set up Congress to impose sanctions on Iran that violate the agreement.There are a number of reasons the president and hard-liners in Washington think that the White House should pursue this path. But their views are built on a set of false assumptions about the nuclear deal that should be laid to rest.First, some of the agreement’s opponents claim that the J.C.P.O.A. is “the worst agreement the United States has ever entered into with another country.” This ignores an important truth: The nuclear deal is not a bilateral agreement between Tehran and Washington. In fact, it isn’t even a multilateral deal that requires ratification in either Congress or the Iranian Parliament. It is, instead, a United Nations Security Council resolution. (Indeed, this explains why the deal continues to have wide support from the other Security Council members, as well as from Secretary General António Guterres.)A second false assumption is that the deal is meant to dictate Iran’s policies in matters unrelated to our nuclear program. This has never been the case. It was always clear that the path to reaching a nuclear deal meant setting aside other geopolitical concerns. Anyone involved in the years of talks that led to the J.C.P.O.A. can attest to this. For example, even as Russia and the United States disagreed on many other issues in the Middle East, they were able to work together at the negotiating table.Reports now indicate the Trump administration wants to tie the nuclear agreement to Iran’s missile program, a move that would go far beyond the J.C.P.O.A.’s intended purpose. Security Council Resolution 2231, which incorporates the nuclear deal, “calls upon” Iran to not work on “ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.” But my country is not seeking to develop or acquire nuclear weapons and this carefully negotiated language does not restrain us from developing conventional military deterrence technology that so many other countries possess. The fact that Iranian missiles are designed for maximum precision proves that they are not designed for nuclear capability, as such delivery vehicles need not be precise in targeting.A third false assumption is that there is a “sunset clause” in the deal, suggesting that in a decade Iran will be free of inspections or limits on its nuclear program. While it’s true that some provisions regarding restrictions will expire, crucial aspects of inspections will not. Moreover, the deal establishes that some six years from now — assuming all participants have fulfilled their obligations — Iran should ratify the Additional Protocol on Nuclear Safeguards, part of the Nonproliferation Treaty. This would subject my country to an extensive I.A.E.A. inspection process. Iran will continue its nuclear program for energy and medical purposes as a normal member of the international community and signatory to the Nonproliferation Treaty after the period of years written into the J.C.P.O.A.We Iranians — like all nations involved in adopting the deal, the international community and nonproliferation experts — recognize that the nuclear agreement was an important diplomatic accomplishment and it remains a credit to the international nonproliferation regime. Among the seven countries that negotiated the nuclear agreement, only America finds the deal’s adoption controversial.What the president and Congress decide to do about recertification is, ultimately, a domestic matter. But if the United States wants to remain credible in future multilateral negotiations, it cannot go against the international consensus and attempt to scuttle past diplomacy whether as political retaliation against a previous administration, or as part of a constant reassessment of American national interests.', 'TEHRAN, Iran – Iran\'s state TV is reporting that a Zoroastrian member of Yazd City Council has been suspended following a complaint.The Monday report said that the Administrative Justice Court issued the suspension for Sepanta Niknam following a complaint by a candidate for the Yazd city council, purportedly over the fencing around the city\'s famed "Tower of Silence".Mohammad Reza Modaresi, a member of the Guardian Council, said that the suspension had been approved by the Council and that everyone should abide by it, according to the report.Earlier in April, just before the country\'s City Council elections, Ahmad Jannati, the head of the Guardian Council, said that religious minorities should not have a representative in towns were the majority of the population was Muslim.', '', '', "Mr. Trump, Don’t Scrap the Iran Deal - The New York TimesIf President Trump refuses to certify that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal this month, he will be making his most feckless foreign policy decision yet. Don’t do it, Mr. President. Be a statesman, listen to your own military and intelligence officials and put the security of America and its allies ahead of your ego.Certification isn’t a requirement of the 2015 deal, in which Iran, after negotiations with the United States and five other major powers, agreed to roll back its nuclear program in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Certification was required by Congress, which passed a law mandating that the president decide every 90 days whether Iran is fulfilling its commitments and whether the deal is in America’s national interest.A decision by Mr. Trump to withhold certification would not, therefore, automatically “tear up” the agreement, as he promised to do in the 2016 campaign. It would, rather, kick the  issue back to Congress, which could then decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions. But that in itself is a risk; and in any case, Mr. Trump’s expression of displeasure with the agreement can only alienate this country’s closest allies, which worked so hard to get a deal.Mr. Trump is in a box of his own making. As a candidate, with no experience in foreign policy, he took a hard line against the deal, and he has stuck with that position, recently describing it in a speech to the United Nations as “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.” That judgment seems to reflect Mr. Trump's knee-jerk habit of repudiating President Barack Obama’s accomplishments, as well as showing the influence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who considers the Iran deal a travesty. Plus, historical antipathy to Iran in the United States remains strong.Mr. Trump has twice agreed to certify the Iran deal, and his national security advisers are urging him to do it again. But he reportedly is annoyed by the process, and is determined to deliver on his campaign promise by the next certification deadline, Oct. 15. That the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran’s nuclear activities; the American intelligence community; and the Pentagon confirm that Iran is honoring its commitments seems to have no effect on Mr. Trump’s thinking.While most of Congress opposed the Iran deal when it was negotiated, many members now see its value and oppose provoking another nuclear crisis as the United States grapples with North Korea. But there is no guarantee of what Congress will do if a bill is introduced reimposing sanctions or seeking to renegotiate the deal. The smart thing, the right thing, for Mr. Trump to do is to recertify. There’s no doubt that Iran is a bad actor on many fronts, not least in its roles in Syria and Yemen. But the United States will have a greater chance of addressing those concerns if it rigorously abides by the nuclear deal and maintains unity with its partners in that endeavor.", '', 'President Trump’s Failing Leadership on Iran - The New York TimesPresident Trump has made clear his hostility toward the Iran nuclear deal, labeling it “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has entered into.” He is right: The ill-constructed deal left Iran with an industrial-scale nuclear program which, when the pact’s terms begin to expire, will provide Iran with a clear pathway to nuclear weapons.But true leadership requires Mr. Trump to do more than focus solely on Iran’s nuclear program; he must also address the broader threats that Iran poses to the region.Under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, the bipartisan Senate compromise used by the Obama administration to get Congress to buy into the nuclear deal, the president must certify every 90 days that, among other things, Iran is fully implementing the nuclear pact and has not committed a material breach. The president must also attest that the agreement is vital to the security interests of the United States.Proponents and opponents of the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, argue about whether Iran is in compliance. Much of the dispute rests on the scope of inspections and access to certain suspect sites. For example, the International Atomic Energy Agency is currently unable to verify the provision relating to “activities which could contribute to the design and development of a nuclear explosive device.” That Russia contends Iran has no obligation to satisfy the I.A.E.A. on this matter highlights the deal’s weakness.The Trump administration is signaling that it plans not to recertify the nuclear agreement before an Oct. 15 deadline. But doing that won’t end the pact. It simply punts the problem over to Congress, which will then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran. The administration has suggested that it will not push Congress to do anything specific, and chances are that Congress will agree.For the president to pass the buck displays neither leadership nor courage. At a minimum, Mr. Trump needs to tell members of Congress what he wants them to do, and then work to ensure the resulting legislation can pass. And whether he decertifies the pact or not, the president must decide by Jan. 12 whether to waive once again the application of one in a broad set of sanctions that existed before the deal was struck and that have been suspended since. It is these waivers, not presidential certifications under the review law, that keep the nuclear deal alive.Last month, at the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Trump demanded freedom for American hostages held by Tehran and called on Iran’s government to “stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.” Fine words, but it remains unclear what the president plans to do to have his demands realized.Partisans may trade blame, but whether because of the 2003 United States-led invasion of Iraq or the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq in 2011, Iran’s efforts to destabilize the Middle East have accelerated. The Syrian civil war only contributed to the perfect storm. Tehran is now aggressively interfering in countries from Afghanistan to the Eastern Mediterranean, and perhaps even farther. And while some place blame on Sunni governments such as Saudi Arabia for providing Iran with opportunities to meddle, Sunni repression hardly excuses Iran’s transfer of weapons to Yemen, Lebanon and others in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions or Tehran’s broader efforts to undermine American allies like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.Strangely, however, Mr. Trump has done little to push back on Iranian expansionism. The United States provides cursory support for operations by the Saudis and United Arab Emirates against Iranian-backed forces in Yemen. And for most of this year, the administration has been funneling financial aid to the Lebanese armed forces, which in turn have been working hand in hand with Iran’s most powerful proxy, Hezbollah, on the Lebanon-Syria border. While the administration has offered inconsistent and lackluster support for the Arab nations challenging Qatar’s support for extremists, it has largely ignored Iran’s growing influence in both Qatar and Oman.Mr. Trump’s oddest capitulations to Iran are in Iraq and Syria. Rather than seize opportunities to push back on Iranian power while pursuing the annihilation of the Islamic State, Team Trump has largely embraced Obama-era nonpolicies in both states. In Iraq, the central government is desperate for assistance to rein in Iranian-backed militias that may have contributed to the fight against the Islamic State but now threaten the country’s stability. If the goal is to prevent a repeat in Iraq of Hezbollah’s slow strangulation of Lebanon, the time is now.Similarly in Syria, despite early hints that he was poised to take on the Tehran-Moscow-Damascus triumvirate, Mr. Trump has been almost supine, to the point of ignoring attacks on American-backed forces. The White House has even shrugged off news that Iran has opened another front against Israel in the Syrian Golan Heights.If rolling back and diminishing Iranian power is the priority Mr. Trump insists it is, simply dumping the nuclear agreement in Congress’s lap may be the worst possible option. That would be politically easy, but it won’t get the job done.', '', 'U.S. Ambassador to U.N. Escalates Confrontation With Iran - The New York TimesThe Trump administration escalated a bitter confrontation with Iran on Wednesday, demanding that the United Nations Security Council punish the Iranian government for what the American ambassador called its “outlaw behavior” across the Middle East.“The United States will not turn a blind eye to these violations,” the United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, told a Security Council meeting that had been meant to focus on developments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Ms. Haley used her speaking time instead to deliver a critique of Iran. Her remarks were among the most strident denunciations Ms. Haley has made of Iran since she became President Trump’s ambassador in January.The remarks seemed timed partly to respond to international criticism of the administration over Mr. Trump’s avowed hostility to the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and major powers, including the United States, which he has described as an embarrassment and a disaster.She spoke less than a week after Mr. Trump announced that he would disavow the nuclear agreement and might withdraw the United States from the accord altogether unless it was strengthened to his satisfaction.That decision has deeply angered Iran — which has ruled out any renegotiation — and has raised alarms among many American allies, including Britain, France and Germany, which were among the parties to the agreement.They have exhorted Congress to preserve the deal, which they say is doing exactly what had been intended — thwarting Iran’s ability to attain a nuclear weapon. They have warned that the United States is risking isolation, loss of credibility and increased global insecurity if the deal unravels.Accusing the Iranian government of having violated at least four Security Council resolutions with impunity, Ms. Haley said that “nearly every threat to peace and security in the Middle East is connected to Iran’s outlaw behavior.”She argued that the nuclear agreement was an insufficient instrument with which to measure Iran’s relations with the world.“Iran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior,” she said. “And we have allowed them to get away with it. This must stop.”Ms. Haley also demanded that the Council take action on what she called Iran’s “most threatening act”: ballistic missile launchings.A Security Council resolution that put the nuclear agreement into effect calls upon Iran to refrain from ballistic missile tests but does not prohibit them. Iran has argued that its missiles are a defensive countermeasure to deter hostile neighbors, notably Israel and Saudi Arabia, both close American allies.There was no indication that other Council members would act on Ms. Haley’s demands. China and Russia, veto-wielding members who also are parties to the Iran nuclear agreement, are strong supporters of it.More broadly, they oppose the Trump administration’s efforts to ostracize Iran.Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gholamali Khoshroo, offered what amounted to a diametrically opposite appraisal of Iran’s behavior in his Council remarks, saying “no country has done more than Iran” in fighting Middle East terrorism, most notably in fighting the Islamic State.“If we had hegemonic ambitions, the nuclear deal would never have been reached,” Mr. Khoshroo said. He said Mr. Trump’s approach “toward the deal and Iran run counter to all of these efforts and intend to add another crisis to the regional issues.”Hours earlier in Tehran, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, delivered a tough denunciation of Mr. Trump’s position on the nuclear deal and his other criticisms of Iran, calling it “a waste of time to respond to such blatherings and nonsensical remarks by the foulmouthed U.S. president.”In a speech to academics carried by Iranian state media, Ayatollah Khamenei said Iran would not renounce the nuclear agreement as long as the United States does not. “But if it does,” he said, “we will shred it to bits.”Mr. Trump’s decision announced last Friday not to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear agreement triggered a provision in American law that gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions that were rescinded under the accord.Ayatollah Khamenei’s remarks suggested that the reimposition of sanctions would be interpreted by Iran as an American withdrawal from the accord. It is unclear whether Congress will take that action.European leaders, including the European Union’s top foreign policy official, Federica Mogherini, who helped negotiate the nuclear agreement, have urged American lawmakers to preserve it. A growing number of disarmament advocates and diplomats also have publicly defended the agreement.In the latest indication of support, a group of 25 former foreign ministers said Wednesday in a letter to congressional leaders that the agreement was in the best interests of the United States.The signers included former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright of the United States and many of her counterparts from Europe and elsewhere.“A unilateral withdrawal from the agreement would have far-reaching adverse consequences for the security of the United States and America’s standing in the world,” the letter said.“We know from experience that the world counts on the United States to live up to its commitments,” it said. “If the United States loses its credibility, the consequences for its security, and the security of its allies, would be disastrous.”In a telephone interview, Ms. Albright said that the group of former ministers, which meets a few times a year, considered the nuclear agreement “such a good example of multilateral cooperation” that its members felt it was important to speak out.Ms. Albright, whose first diplomatic post was as the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said she understood Ms. Haley’s concerns about Iran’s “counterproductive and dangerous” activities.Still, she said: “Everything would be more serious if they had a nuclear weapon. You’re safer if they don’t have one.”', '', 'The U.S. military must figure out how to keep Iraq from breaking apart while also preventing neighboring Iran from turning Iraq into a proxy state; Jennifer Griffin reports on \'Special Report.\'Today, the Islamic State controls just three percent of Iraq after controlling one-third of the country two years ago, but American officials say an old nemesis in the region continues to stoke tensions inside the country, creating another immediate challenge once ISIS is defeated.After the fall of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and the evacuation of Kurdish fighters, the U.S. military must figure out how to keep Iraq from breaking apart while also preventing Iran from turning its neighbor into a proxy state."Nearly every threat to peace and security in the Middle East is connected to Iran\'s outlaw behavior," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Wednesday.The Shia-led government in Baghdad welcomed Iran\'s help when ISIS swept through Iraqi cities three years ago.

Joseph Votel, commander of U.S. Central Command.U.S. military commanders on the ground have to be more diplomatic to avoid antagonizing Baghdad, whose permission they need to stay in Iraq.In a briefing to Pentagon reporters from Baghdad, Army Col. Ryan Dillon said he saw no evidence Iran played a role in pushing Kurdish fighters out of Kirkuk on Monday, even though photos and videos emerged on social media of a Shiite Iraqi commander, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis -- who maintains close ties to Iran and has been sanctioned by the Treasury Department since 2009 -- taking part in the flag-raising ceremony after Iraqi forces moved in.Photos taken in Kirkuk also showed the shadowy Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, leader of Tehran\'s proxy forces in the Middle East. Soleimani is also sanctioned by the U.S. government, in part due to his involvement in the attempted assassination of then-Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States Adel Al-Jubeir outside a popular Washington, D.C. restaurant in 2011.At the U.N.

This is an open and direct violation of [resolution] 2231, and yet where is the outrage of this council?"The Pentagon steered clear of blaming Tehran earlier this week as Iraq took back the city and adjacent oil fields, which the Kurds had relied on as a key revenue source since 2014.Despite reports that dozens of Kurdish troops were killed when the Iraqi military stormed Kirkuk Monday, the U.S. military says it is aware of only one minor skirmish, which was based on a "misunderstanding.""What we have seen is a peaceful handover of areas around Kirkuk," said Dillon, a U.S. military spokesman for the international coalition to defeat ISIS. "It was a coordinated effort between Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish security forces that were there and they handed over the keys."The State Department also refused to acknowledge the possibility that any role in the Kirkuk offensive was played by Iran."As we watch the situation unfold in Iraq, we continue to call for calm, to call for calm on the part of the Kurds, on the part of the government in Baghdad as well. We have made no bones about that," said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert Tuesday.Nauert said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was making calls to leaders in the region to defuse the crisis.Kurdish forces had held Kirkuk since 2014, after the ISIS fight began. The Iraqi government decided to take the city back after the Kurds held a referendum on independence last month.Iran\'s deputy U.N. Ambassador,Gholamali Khoshroo, rejected any suggestion that Tehran is playing a nefarious role, blaming what he called, "the hostile policies of the United States and its regional allies, especially the Zionist regime, that have turned the region into a tinderbox."A year ago Monday, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters teamed up with Iraqi forces to kick ISIS out of Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city. Now those two U.S. allies have turned on each other, and many U.S. officials blame Iran.Jennifer Griffin currently serves as a national security correspondent for FOX News Channel .

Ordinary Iranians reportedly took their grievances against the Tehran regime today to the country’s parliament as a result of what they say are the regime’s plundering of their savings and its corrupt policies.According to a report and video from an Iranian opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), there were more than 2,000 people protesting outside the country’s parliament, known as the Majlis. The protesters who were accosted by the police shouted slogans against the regime:“Shame, shame on the police force!”“Death to the dictator.”“Death to the demagogue.”Upon police arresting female protesters, the crowd, it reported, shouted more antagonistic chants against the regime.“You are ISIS, you are ISIS, death to ISIS, let them go.”“Shame on Rouhani.”“They had a budget deficit, so they took our money,” was another chant, according to the NCRI.Fox News reported last week that President Donald Trump’s speech on the Iran nuclear deal emboldened protesters after he said that his administration stood in solidarity with ordinary Iranians.According to various reports, protests started over a financial scandal where thousands of people trusted their lifesavings with government institutions only to lose it or not be allowed to collect on it. The protests started in 2016 but have become increasingly political this year.Many of the investments are reportedly run or tied to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which was recently designated through the Department of Treasury for its terrorist activities by Trump.“I will kill, I will kill the one who killed my brother,” the protesters are reported to have shouted as the police moved into arrest them. Protesters, the NCRI report said, had thrown rocks, wood and other objects at the police.The report also said that as the police surrounded the protesters they broke through police barriers and were joined by many bystanders, all this as a motorized unit was deployed. The protesters responded, it said, by pelting the police with rocks.“The courageous chants in today’s demonstrations targeting the heads of the Judiciary and Executive Branch, as well as the suppressive State Security Force and intelligence forces, reflect the Iranian people’s desire for the overthrow of the mullahs’ religious dictatorship,” Maryam Rajavi, the head of the NCRI, said in a statement released today.In her statement, Rajavi especially called on young Iranians to support their countrymen and women and protest for their rights and expand the protests.“Institutionalized fraud along with institutionalized murder and belligerence constitute the pillars of the mullahs’ decadent regime. Ali Khamenei and his office hold the strings controlling all the depraved crimes taking place in the country. As long as this regime is in power, there will be no end to the astronomical embezzlement, poverty, unemployment and catastrophic economic conditions,” her statement said.Protesters also criticized the head of Iran’s judiciary, Ayatollah Mohammad Sadeq Amoli Larijani, who was appointed to a 10-year term by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. The protesters called out, according to the NCRI report:“Larijani is a judge. He is the playmate of the thieves,” they shouted against the country’s regime.Ben Evansky reports for Fox Newson the United Nations and international affairs.He can befollowed@BenEvansky', 'Iran Saps Strength of Revolutionary Guards With Arrests and Cutbacks - The New York TimesTEHRAN — From its nine-story headquarters in an upscale neighborhood of Tehran, a giant construction company directs its operations across Iran, building mosques, airports, oil and gas installations, hospitals, and skyscrapers.Armed guards stand watch at the doors, and small posters on its exterior walls honor Iranians who have died in the current wars in Syria and Iraq.But this is not just any company. Khatam-al Anbiya, whose name means “seal of the prophet,” is the most important economic arm of Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. It employs nearly 1.5 million people, including subcontractors, and is led by a military commander.Yet the company’s outward signs of strength belie the powerful currents of change that are eroding its business. A crackdown is being led by Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, who ran for office promising to unleash economic growth by completing a nuclear deal and freeing the country from international sanctions.Having achieved that — though some sanctions remain — he has turned his sights on the Revolutionary Guards, whose monopoly on large sectors of the economy and penchant for corrupt dealing he sees as a major drag on the growth he promised after completing the nuclear pact.In his assault on a bastion of privilege and power long thought to be impregnable, Mr. Rouhani seems to have the all-important support of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader. The ayatollah, who has blasted officials for allowing corruption to grow in all layers of Iran’s political system, including the government, called recently for the government to reach out to foreign countries for investments and new businesses.“What I sought is that in the economy, we must have free competition,” Mr. Rouhani told a group of news media executives during his visit to the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. “No institution can use its authority to derive a benefit. We must be open and fair, and there can be no exclusivity in any one sector.”“All the sectors must be productive,” he said. “We are pushing and promoting a more open atmosphere for businesses, with open and fair competition and no exclusive sectors.”For years, the construction giant and numerous other companies and conglomerates run by the Revolutionary Guards have operated with impunity, well beyond the reach of civilian authorities, driving Iran’s sanctions-crippled economy, financing its military adventures in the region and — not coincidentally — enriching the hard-line commanders and clerics at their helms.But now, with many sanctions lifted after the nuclear deal, and as the government tries to open the country to competition and foreign investment, the group’s economic dominance is increasingly seen as a liability.The Revolutionary Guards’ international reputation for regional meddling, its potential designation as a terrorist group by the Trump administration and the sanctions that remain in place combine to make it a toxic business partner for the Western and Asian companies Tehran needs to reinvigorate its economy and rebuild its crumbling infrastructure.As a result, it has had its budget cut and seen large government projects that were once its private preserve steered to outsiders. Several senior members of the Revolutionary Guards have been arrested on suspicion of corruption.The changes have unfolded steadily since the summer. In July, lawmakers told local news outlets that the government had decided to cut Khatam-al Anbiya’s annual budget. “They cannot take over every project anymore,” a lawmaker, Gholamreza Tajgardoon, told the newspaper Shargh. “Not the ones that private contractors can also do.”Over the summer, several former Revolutionary Guards officials were arrested on suspicion of corruption by the intelligence service of the organization itself, an influential member of Parliament confirmed last week on the Telegram messaging service. Two hard-line media strategists affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards have also been arrested, in a sign that their influential media empire is under siege.More recently, Khatam-al Anbiya was sidelined in two major oil and shipping projects, which went to bidders from France and South Korea.Insiders say the arrests confirm that the Revolutionary Guards’ top echelon is now committed to curbing corruption and smuggling by its forces, which control all of Iran’s borders.“It took a lot of effort, but President Rouhani has convinced the top commanders that if systematic corruption and favoritism are not taken seriously, the pillars of the regime will be undermined,” said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the government. “These cases are the tip of an iceberg of wide and systematic corruption in the country at all levels of the state.”In most of the world, the Revolutionary Guards Corps is known for its military wing, which has been leading Iranian efforts to support its ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, in his fight against rebels and Islamic State militants. It has sent thousands of Iranian soldiers to advise and to fight, helping to tip the balance in both wars. Domestically, the Revolutionary Guards oversee Iran’s aggressive missile program, which has caused enormous friction with the Trump administration.In line with its increasingly prominent military role, the Revolutionary Guards’ budget for military and missile activities has increased recently. But its economic activities are increasingly seen by top officials as a liability.It was the United States-led imposition of punitive international sanctions during the Obama years that empowered the Revolutionary Guards’ role in the economy. At the height of the sanctions, beginning in 2009, the Iranian government found itself cut off from international credit. With foreign companies pulling out and global banks unwilling to finance trade or investment, Tehran was forced to turn to the Revolutionary Guards to keep the country running.“During the sanctions, we couldn’t export, we needed goods. The Guards stepped in, and we are proud of it,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, an analyst close to Iran’s leaders. He described how the Revolutionary Guards took over oil projects from companies like Royal Dutch Shell, sold oil to some willing countries and engineered complex methods of transferring cash into the country. “They brought in hard currency,” he said. “They saved the country.”(From that perspective, President Trump’s refusal last week to recertify the Iran nuclear deal — and the possibility of new unilateral sanctions that brings — could be welcome news for the Revolutionary Guards, restoring them to a central role in the economy.)After the harshest sanctions were lifted, following the nuclear agreement in 2015, Iran’s economy needed fresh blood, many in the government thought. “We need a more competitive economy, that’s it,” said Mr. Laylaz, the economist.Tensions over the Revolutionary Guards’ economic activities first surfaced during Mr. Rouhani’s re-election campaign in May, when he implied that the group was the primary beneficiary of several rounds of privatization.“We handed our economy to a government that has guns, media, many other things, and no one dares to compete with them,” he said. “This is not privatization.”The Revolutionary Guards, which have sharply criticized Mr. Rouhani for the compromises his government made to cinch the nuclear agreement, was quick to answer, pointing to its military importance.“We believe that the government, which does not possess guns, could be humiliated by the enemy and surrender,” the commander of the group, Maj. Gen. Ali Jafari, responded.After Mr. Rouhani’s electoral victory in May, there were two high-level meetings with Revolutionary Guards commanders. As a result, and possibly after Ayatollah Khamenei threw his support to Mr. Rouhani, they seem to be falling in line.Even the conservative news media has been muzzled. Two media figures affiliated with the Guards, Reza Golpour and Mohammad Hossein Rostami, were arrested and accused of cooperating with Israeli intelligence, the state newspaper Kayhan reported. Their arrest has marginalized the hard-line media network and research group they worked for the Ammar Strategic Base, that for nearly a decade made vicious attacks against opponents of hard-liners.“There is a media war, too,” Mr. Layaz said, adding that in recent months several administrators of pro-Rouhani channels on Telegram had also been arrested.It would be wrong to assume the Revolutionary Guards will be forced entirely from the Iranian economy anytime soon, said Bahman Esghi, the secretary general of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce. Constitutionally, it is required to use its assets in peacetime to help with economic development, and practically speaking, since the private sector accounts for only 20 percent of the economy, the country needs its heft.“The reality is that the Guards Corps is the locomotive of our economy,” he said. “Our private sector simply is way too small to replace it.”', "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – Iran's foreign minister has arrived in Oman for a daylong visit with officials in the sultanate, which has served as a crucial link between Iran and the U.S. in the past.The state-run Oman News Agency reported on Monday that Mohammad Javad Zarif was met by Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdallah, the minister responsible for foreign affairs, on his arrival in Muscat.Iran's semi-official ISNA news agency reported that Zarif will speak with Omani officials about the wars in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and other issues.Zarif is due to travel to Qatar on Tuesday. His visit to the peninsular nation comes as four Arab nations are boycotting Qatar over its alleged support for extremists and what they say are Qatar's overly warm ties to Iran.Qatar denies supporting extremists.", 'President Trump allows the Obama administration\'s Iran deal to stand, but he chooses not to certify it. Doing so, he kicks the decision making to congress. What are their options?President Trump announced Friday he will decertify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, saying he believes the “radical regime” has committedmultiple violations of theagreement as he kicked a decision over whether to restore sanctions back to Congress.“I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification,” Trump said during a speech at the White House. “We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror, and the very real threat of Iran\'s nuclear breakthrough.”Friday\'s announcement does not withdraw the United States from the Iran deal, which the president called “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.”But the president threatened that he could still ultimately pull out of the deal.“In the event we are notable to reach a solution workingwith Congress and our allies,the agreement will be terminated,” he said. “It is under continuous reviewand our participation can becanceled by me as president atany time.”Speaking to reporters ahead of Trump’s speech, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the president will use the Congressional Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to decertify the agreement, which was negotiated over 18 months by the Obama administration.Congress could then decide to restore sanctions, do nothing or make changes to the law. Trump is pressing Congress to work to fix the deal\'s "flaws."IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL: WHAT IS IT?In making his decision, Trump said, “Iran is not living up to the spirit of the deal.”Among other alleged violations, Trump said Iran failed to meet expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges and intimidated international inspectors into not using their full authority.The president also slammed sunset provisions in the deal itself, complaining that the U.S. got a “weak inspection” in exchange for a “short-term” delay in Iran’s nuclear progress.Trump, meanwhile, announced plans to take action against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, authorizing the Treasury Department to impose targeted sanctions against “its officials, agents, andaffiliates.”“Execution of our strategy beginswith a long overdue step ofimposing tough sanctions onIran\'s Islamic RevolutionaryGuard Corps,” Trump said. “The revolutionary guard is theIranian supreme leader’s corruptpersonal terror force andmilitia.”In his broadside against the Iranian regime, the president said it “remains the world\'s leading state sponsor of terrorism,” accusing it of providing assistance to Al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah and other terrorist networks.The president accused Iran of developing missiles that threaten American troops and allies and imprisoning Americans “on false charges.”“Given the regime\'s murderous past and present, we should not take lightly its sinister vision for the future,” Trump said. “The regimes two favorite chants are ‘Death to America’ and ‘Death to Israel.’”The president did not designate the IRGC a terrorist group, something that had been rumored ahead of the announcement. In the run-up to the decision, Iranian officials threatened consequences if that occurred.“If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world,” IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said Sunday, according to Reuters.The National Resistance Council of Iran, an offshoot organization of the People\'s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK), praised Trump\'s move in support of the de-certification.Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), welcomed the new U.S. policy to "condemn the IRGC\'s gross violations of human rights" in Iran."The regime\'s deadly meddling in the region and concessions made to it in the course of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) have been disastrous, and for which the people of Iran and the region have paid heavily," Rajavi said in a statement provided to Fox News."The IRGC is a prime means of suppression, execution, and torture in Iran, spreading terrorism throughout the world, war mongering and massacre in the region, the drive for acquiring nuclear weapons, and the increase in the proliferation of ballistic missiles," she said. "If the IRGC had been recognized as a terrorist entity earlier and dealt with accordingly, the current situation in the region in general, and Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and Afghanistan in particular, would have been totally different."Trump had been facing a Sunday deadline to notify Congress whether Iran is complying with the accord.Republicans are calling for new legislation that addresses the “flaws” of the agreement.“Lawmakers need to do now what we couldn’t do two years ago: unite around an Iran strategy that truly stops Iran’s nuclear weapons program and empowers the United States and our allies to combat the full spectrum of Iran’s imperial aggression,” Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said in a statement.Democrats accused the president of making matters worse. Former Obama administration official Ben Rhodes, who helped sell the Iran deal, said the president is “provoking” a crisis with his speech.“Hard to overstate how irresponsible it is for Trump to risk blowing up Iran Deal by demanding rest of world justify his campaign rhetoric,” Rhodes tweeted.Fox News’ Serafin Gomez, Mike Emanuel and Perry Chiaramonte and The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'Listen to ‘The Daily’: Trump and the Iran Nuclear Deal - The New York TimesListen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via RadioPublic | Via StitcherPresident Trump has disavowed the Iran nuclear deal, and he has threatened to leave it altogether if Congress does not amend it to permanently block Tehran from building nuclear weapons or intercontinental ballistic missiles.Today, a top negotiator in the Obama administration talks about how the deal was reached, and what it feels like to watch Mr. Trump threaten to undo it.On today’s episode:• Jake Sullivan, a former director of policy planning at the State Department, discusses the negotiations.• Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, talks about how President Trump is trying to undo the deal.Background reading:• What is the Iran deal?

Take a look at some of the strange finds.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – A journal made public by the CIA and apparently handwritten by one of Osama bin Laden\'s daughters offers a glimpse into how the late al-Qaida leader viewed the world around him and reveals his deep interest in the 2011 Arab Spring revolutions that were unfolding in the months before a U.S. raid killed him.He talks about Libya becoming a pathway for jihadis to Europe; of his time as a young teen visiting William Shakespeare\'s home in Britain; of how quickly turmoil had gripped the Middle East.The 228-page journal meanders between discussions, thoughts and reflections bin Laden shared with his family about how to exploit the uprisings, what to make of the rapid changes unfolding in the Arab world and when al-Qaida should speak out."This chaos and the absence of leadership in the revolutions is the best environment to spread al-Qaida\'s thoughts and ideas," bin Laden is quoted as telling his family in the document.Bin Laden\'s wife, referred to as Um Hamza, assures him that a tape he released seven years earlier calling out the rulers of the region as unfit could be one of the major forces behind the Arab Spring protests roiling the region.The Associated Press examined a copy of the journal uploaded by the Long War Journal to its website. The CIA released it on Wednesday as part of a trove of material recovered during the May 2011 raid that killed bin Laden, then took down the files, saying they were "temporarily unavailable pending resolution of a technical issue."The journal appears to cover conversations between bin Laden and his daughters, Miriam and Somiya, his wife and his sons, Khaled and Hamza — the latter of whom would go on to become a potential successor to lead the group his father founded.The journal is titled, "Special diaries for Abu Abdullah: Sheikh Abdullah\'s points of view — A session with the family," which refers to bin Laden by his traditional Arabic name. The conversations took place between February and April 2011, with the journal entries dated according to the Islamic calendar.During that time, uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt had ousted longtime autocratic rulers, touching off protests in Libya, Yemen, Bahrain and Syria. The Middle East was on the cusp of unstoppable change, chaos and turmoil.In Libya, the uprising there would end with Moammar Gadhafi\'s death months after bin Laden was killed. In Yemen, al-Qaida would gain a greater foothold and remain active amid the chaos of war and famine. In Bahrain, the Sunni-led monarchy would launch a crackdown on the country\'s Shiite majority. In Syria, the government\'s lethal response to a protest by schoolchildren in early 2011 would spark mass protests across the country and ignite a war and massive refugee crisis that continues today.The reflections, jotted down in blue ink at times and at others in red, refer repeatedly to media reports of what was happening across the region.At one point, they criticize Al-Jazeera TV\'s broadcast of gruesome images from a deadly protest in Yemen, saying that a warning should have been given in order to shield children from viewing them. However, the Qatari-backed channel is also hailed for "working on toppling regimes" and for "carrying the banner of the revolutions."Bin Laden appears concerned by the speed of some of the region\'s revolts, believing that a gradual approach would help avoid the backlash of a counter-revolution as regime figures sought to hold onto power at all cost."I am upset by the timing of the revolutions. We told them to slow down," bin Laden is quoted as saying, though it\'s not entirely clear which countries he is referring to.On Libya, bin Laden says he believes the uprising "has opened the door for jihadists.""This is why Gadhafi and his son say that the extremists will come from the sea, which will be an area of operation for al-Qaida. This will be the Somalia of the Mediterranean," he is quoted as saying.Still, bin Laden appears reluctant to issue a statement in support of Islamists in Libya for fear that if Gadhafi is ousted, the U.S. will try to expand its footprint there.Yemen is a primary focus of the journal entries. Al-Qaida\'s branch there is among its most active in the world and the journal suggests al-Qaida was plotting an assassination attempt against Yemen\'s embattled ruler at the time, Ali Abdullah Saleh.There is little indication that the writer had much information about what was happening in the region beyond what was reported in the media. This could indicate that bin Laden had become isolated in his final months hiding out in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where U.S. forces would find and kill him a little over a month later. Or it could also be that bin Laden was shielding his relatives from al-Qaida intelligence.In the early pages of the document, bin Laden is asked about his thoughts on jihad, and replies that he first considered it "in secondary school."He says this was a result of his home and school environment. Separately, he describes his father as a pious man."There wasn\'t a particular group that was guiding me, like the Muslim Brotherhood," he is quoted as saying.From a young age, he appeared to be unfazed by worldly spoils, recounting a story about declining a new watch from his wealthy father.He recalls a summer spent studying in the U.K. when he was 14, including a visit to the home of William Shakespeare. His time in Britain left him feeling uneasy and he decided not to return the following summer."I saw that they were a society different from ours and that they were morally corrupt," he says.Bin Laden imagines that Saudi Arabia would soon feel the "tsunami" of change sweeping the region. The late al-Qaida chief held Saudi citizenship until the early 1990s, before he was stripped of his nationality by the government.He talks about wanting to deliver a message to Saudi youth and Saudi rulers: "The flood is coming and it will lead to a change so there is no need for violence."___Michael and Badr reported from Cairo, Salaheddin from Baghdad and Harb from Dubai.', 'Saad Hariri Quits as Lebanon Prime Minister, Blaming Iran - The New York TimesBEIRUT, Lebanon — Prime Minister Saad Hariri of Lebanon said on Saturday that he had quit his post, blaming Iran for interference in Arab affairs and throwing his country, already awash with tensions and regional rivalries, into deeper uncertainty.Mr. Hariri, speaking in a televised address from the Saudi capital, Riyadh, issued a blistering condemnation of Iran and its growing power and influence in the region. He also assailed Iran’s Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, the Shiite militia and political party that is part of the national unity cabinet he led.“Wherever Iran settles, it sows discord, devastation and destruction, proven by its interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries,” Mr. Hariri said, adding that Iran’s “hands” in the region “will be cut off.”The surprise announcement — which shocked even his own staff — was an ominous sign of the escalating regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, analysts said, indicating the growing dominance of Iran and Hezbollah as well as the Saudis’ increasingly assertive response.Lebanese and regional analysts, whether supporters or opponents of Hezbollah, said it appeared that Mr. Hariri had been pressured to resign by his patrons, the Saudis, as they and the United States ratchet up efforts to counter Iranian influence. The resignation came after weeks of sharp American and Saudi condemnations of Iran, including from President Trump, and new American sanctions against Hezbollah.By pushing out Mr. Hariri, analysts said, Saudi Arabia could deny Hezbollah a credible Sunni governing partner — an attempt to isolate it and deny it the fig leaf of a national unity government.“They concluded that Hariri was serving as more of a cover for Iranian and Hezbollah influence than as a counterweight to them,” said Rob Malley, a former special Middle East adviser to President Barack Obama and the vice president of the International Crisis Group.Yet the resignation also shows how few options Iran’s opponents have. Without Mr. Hariri in power, the United States and Saudi Arabia lose their main partner in the Lebanese government.Across the political spectrum, analysts and officials said the resignation ushered in new dangers. If the next government is more pro-Hezbollah, they said, that could lead to devastating sanctions. It could even increase the chances of a new war with Israel, which would see added justification for its argument that there is little distinction between Hezbollah and the Lebanese state.Mr. Hariri even raised the specter of internal violence. He compared the atmosphere in Lebanon now to the days before the 2005 assassination of his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying he believed his own life was in danger. “I sensed what’s being woven in secret to target my life,” he said.Mr. Hariri’s father was killed when his motorcade was bombed on Beirut’s seafront. Several Hezbollah members are being tried in absentia in a special United Nations-backed tribunal in The Hague, although the militant group has denied involvement in the assassination.Saad Hariri became prime minister in late 2016, in a compromise deal after Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, became president, ending a two-and-a-half-year political deadlock.Lebanon, which is governed by a sect-based political system, has long been deeply divided between a bloc aligned with Shiite Hezbollah and Iran, and one aligned with Saudi Arabia, the dominant Sunni country in the region.Mr. Hariri headed a 30-member national unity cabinet that was crafted to protect the country from any spillover from the multisided war in neighboring Syria, where Iran backed the government and Saudi Arabia backed the insurgents.That mission has largely been successful, even though Hezbollah has sided with the Syrian government, Lebanese Sunni militants have joined insurgents there, and well over one million refugees flooded this small Mediterranean country.In Lebanon’s political system, power is divided between a prime minister, who must be Sunni; a president, who must be Maronite Christian; and a speaker of Parliament, who must be Shiite.The exercise of real power in the country is a more complicated affair of alliances, rivalries and division of spoils between the leaders of sectarian groups, including former warlords from Lebanon’s civil war.Hezbollah, which rose to prominence fighting the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon, is the strongest because of its powerful militia, which can act independently of the state and in recent years has served as an expeditionary force across Syria.In recent years Lebanon’s rival blocs have essentially agreed to confine their fight to Syria. But tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have only increased.In addition to Hezbollah’s decisive role in helping President Bashar al-Assad of Syria hold on to power, Iran has supported several militias in Iraq that have managed to defeat Islamic State forces in that country and remain a fighting force.Iranian leaders say their interference is needed to stop terrorism, and to create a security zone for their country. The country’s influence started to rise after the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq in 2011, leaving behind an incomplete army and a pro-Iranian government.Iran’s filling of the vacuum created by the departure of the United States military has been an extremely worrying development for Saudi Arabia and some other Arab states, who have seen their efforts to fight proxy wars with Iran largely fail.And now that the Syrian war seems to be entering a new phase, with Mr. Assad still ruling a devastated country, there are fears that tensions that had been pushed to the back burner — inside Lebanon, between Hezbollah and Israel, and elsewhere — could re-emerge.The United States has stepped up sanctions on Hezbollah in recent weeks after President Trump criticized Iran and the landmark nuclear deal it reached under Mr. Obama.“It signals a new phase of escalation,” said Ali Rizk, a pro-Hezbollah Lebanese analyst, adding that after the Islamic State is defeated, the United States will put new pressure on what it sees as Shiite extremists. “Lebanon is in for a hard time,” Mr. Rizk said.The resignation brought sharp words from Israel and Iran. Bahram Ghasemi, a spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, said Mr. Hariri’s speech was driven by a Saudi, American and Israeli effort aimed at “creating tension in Lebanon and the region.”And in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the resignation “a wake-up call for the international community to take action against the Iranian aggression.”The pressure now is on the Lebanese president, Mr. Aoun, who will hold consultations with Parliament about appointing a caretaker government, said Imad Salamey, an analyst at the Lebanese American University in Beirut.“If he indeed is going to bring in a pro-Hezbollah government, then he has to face the consequences,” such as new sanctions, Mr. Salamey said. “It will be a massive U.S. and Saudi response. The economy will collapse for sure.”In his speech, Mr. Hariri said he wanted to unite Lebanon and free it from outside influence. He pronounced himself “full of optimism and hope that Lebanon will be stronger, free, independent, with no authority over it except that of its own great people.”But in the streets of Tariq al-Jdeedeh, a mostly Sunni neighborhood of Beirut that is part of Mr. Hariri’s political base, anger and confusion contrasted with the posters of Mr. Hariri that festooned the buildings.“Hariri didn’t do this for Lebanon, he did this for Saudi against Iran,” said Nabil Idriss, who was tending his son’s fabric shop. “Now with this move, the picture is more transparent than ever. Saad Hariri was never in control.”', 'ANKARA, Turkey – A senior Turkish government minister on Thursday branded the New York trial of a Turkish bank executive on charges of violation of sanctions against Iran as a new attempt by U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen to harm Turkey\'s government.Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag, the government spokesman, also told state-run Anadolu Agency that Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, now a witness in the trial, is being pressured to slander Turkey.Zarrab has pleaded guilty and is now cooperating with U.S. investigators against Halkbank\'s former deputy chief, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who is charged in a conspiracy that involved bribes and kickbacks to high-level government officials.Zarrab testified on Wednesday that he paid over $50 million in bribes to Turkey\'s former finance minister Zafer Caglayan in 2012 for his help in laundering Iranian money. He said the sanctions-evasion scheme was done in consultation with Atilla, who has pleaded not guilty.Turkey claims that the U.S. judiciary has been influenced by a network led by Gulen and has portrayed the trial, which has added to tensions between Ankara and Washington, as a sham aimed at discrediting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\'s government.Turkey accuses Gulen of orchestrating last year\'s failed coup and wants him extradited. Gulen denies involvement.Ankara also says Gulen\'s movement was behind a bribery and corruption scandal involving Zarrab and sons of ministers in 2013. The scandal led to Caglayan and three other ministers\' resignations but the allegations were dropped after Erdogan dismissed police and prosecutors conducting the probe."What (Gulen\'s movement) was not able to achieve here, it is trying to achieve there (New York)," Bozdag said.He also said the trial would not succeed in "destroying the love and respect" of the Turkish people toward Erdogan.Meanwhile, Halkbank issued a statement on Thursday insisting that it "strictly adheres to national and international regulations" in all businesses and transactions."Foreign trade transactions and money transfers are conducted in an open, transparent manner and can be monitored by the relevant authorities," the bank said.', "Trump Bashing and a Missile: Tehran Marks U.S. Embassy Takeover - The New York TimesA ballistic missile and signs mocking President Trump were on display on the streets of Tehran on Saturday as thousands of Iranians gathered for the anniversary of the 1979 seizure of the United States Embassy.The commemoration, always a forum for the airing of anti-American sentiment, took on new vitriol this year, directed at President Trump.Fifty-two American diplomats and support personnel were held hostage for 444 days in the takeover, which has shaped the two countries’ relationship ever since.Tensions have flared in recent weeks as President Trump disavowed the Iran nuclear deal and denounced the country's influence in the Middle East.Mr. Trump has called the nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration “an embarrassment,” and Iran a “rogue nation.”On Saturday, Iranians at the rally outside the former embassy, now maintained by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, had equally harsh words for Mr. Trump.In an address to the crowd, Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, denounced American foreign policy, according to Iranian state-run news outlet Press TV. “The U.S. has long been dealt blows by our country and our region and thus regularly bares its warmongering teeth,” he said.", 'Saudi Arabia Charges Iran With ‘Act of War,’ Raising Threat of Military Clash - The New York TimesLONDON — Saudi Arabia charged Monday that a missile fired at its capital from Yemen over the weekend was an “act of war” by Iran, in the sharpest escalation in nearly three decades of mounting hostility between the two regional rivals.“We see this as an act of war,” the Saudi foreign minister, Adel Jubair, said in an interview on CNN. “Iran cannot lob missiles at Saudi cities and towns and expect us not to take steps.”The accusation, which Iran denied, came a day after a wave of arrests in Saudi Arabia that appeared to complete the consolidation of power by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, 32. Taken together, the two actions signaled a new aggressiveness by the prince both at home and abroad, as well as a new and more dangerous stage in the Saudi cold war with Iran for dominance in the region.“Today confrontation is the name of the game,” said Joseph A. Kechichian, a scholar at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who is close to the royal family. “This young man, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is not willing to roll over and play dead. If you challenge him, he is saying, he is going to respond.”The accusations raise the threat of a direct military clash between the two regional heavyweights at a time when they are already fighting proxy wars in Yemen and Syria, as well as battles for political power in Iraq and Lebanon. By the end of the day Monday, a Saudi minister was accusing Lebanon of declaring war against Saudi Arabia as well.Even before the launching of the missile on Saturday, which was intercepted en route to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, the crown prince had staged another surprise demonstration of the kingdom’s newly aggressive posture toward Iran and Lebanon. The prince hosted a visit from Saudi Arabia’s chief Lebanese client, Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who stunned the region by announcing his resignation, via video from Riyadh, in protest against Iran’s undue influence in Lebanese politics.Even some of Mr. Hariri’s rivals speculated that his Saudi sponsors had pressured him into the statement. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia, said over the weekend that the Saudis had all but kidnapped Mr. Hariri. Mr. Nasrallah urged Mr. Hariri to return to Lebanon for power-sharing talks “if he is allowed to come back.”On Monday, Saudi Arabia released a photograph of Mr. Hariri meeting with King Salman that was widely seen as an effort to contradict the theory that the prime minister was effectively a hostage.The Saudi claims that Iran had provided the missile could not be independently verified.Mr. Jubair, the foreign minister, said the missile had been smuggled into Yemen in parts, assembled in Yemen by operatives from Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran, and fired from Yemen by Hezbollah.A statement from the Saudi Arabian news agency said “experts in military technology” had determined from the remains of that missile and one launched in July that both had come from Iran “for the purpose of attacking the kingdom.”Citing allegations of Hezbollah’s role, Thamer al-Sabhan, minister of state for Persian Gulf affairs, said Monday that Saudi Arabia considered the missile attack an act of war by Lebanon as well.“We will treat the government of Lebanon as a government declaring a war because of Hezbollah militias,” Mr. Sabhan told the Saudi-controlled Al Arabiya network. “Lebanon is kidnapped by the militias of Hezbollah and behind it is Iran.”The top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran called the accusation of Iranian involvement in the missile attack “baseless.”“These missiles were produced by the Yemenis and their military industry,” the commander, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, told the semiofficial news agency Tasnim.Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, accused Saudi Arabia of “wars of aggression, regional bullying, destabilizing behavior & risky provocations,” in a statement on Twitter. Saudi Arabia “bombs Yemen to smithereens, killing 1000’s of innocents including babies, spreads cholera and famine, but of course blames Iran,” Mr. Zarif said.American officials have previously accused Iran of arming its Yemeni allies, the Houthis. But it was unclear how Saudi experts would know how or why Iran provided the missiles.With help from allies including the United Arab Emirates and the United States, Saudi Arabia has enforced a sea and air blockade around Yemen since it launched an attack on the Houthi forces there more than two years ago.In Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed’s grip on power tightened further on Monday. American officials tracking the situation said that as many as 500 people, including at least 11 princes, had been rounded up in a wave of arrests directed by Prince Mohammed in the name of a crackdown on corruption.Some are expected to face undisclosed criminal charges while others may be pressured to testify about their roles in corruption schemes. Men were sleeping on mats on the floor of the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton, which has been transformed into a singularly luxurious prison to house the detainees.The arrests cemented Prince Mohammed’s dominance over military, foreign, internal security, economic and social affairs inside the kingdom, freeing him to pursue an aggressive confrontation with Iran. That posture has been a hallmark of his rise over the two and a half years since his father, King Salman, 81, took the throne.Prince Mohammed has sharply escalated a cold war with Iran, stepping up Saudi Arabia’s efforts to push back Iranian influence in the Syrian civil war, plunging the kingdom into a protracted military conflict against Iranian-allied forces in Yemen, and isolating neighboring Qatar in part for being too close to Iran.His hawkish stance toward Iran also appears to have formed the basis for a close bond with President Trump, who visited Riyadh this year and maintained a conspicuous silence over the weekend about Prince Mohammed’s campaign of arrests. On Tuesday while traveling in Asia, he praised the arrests, saying the king and crown prince “know exactly what they are doing.”Mr. Trump’s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, recently left Riyadh after his third visit this year. Prince Mohammed and Mr. Kushner stayed up talking together until the small hours of the morning at a ranch in the desert, according to an American official briefed on the trip.Mr. Kechichian, of the King Faisal Center, said the arrests and the confrontation with Iran represented the convergence of two long-term agendas for Prince Mohammed.“Inside he has been able to put his men into positions of influence and he has pushed aside his rivals,” Mr. Kechichian said. “And ever since President Trump’s visit to Riyadh there has been a very consistent policy with the essential coordination of the United States, and Iran is in the bull’s-eye.”Robert Jordan, a former American ambassador to Saudi Arabia who now practices law in the region, said Prince Mohammed’s aggression was “compounded somewhat by what people would call a green light from President Trump.”Mr. Trump has encouraged Saudi Arabia and its allies “to be more forceful against Iran, and to take more charge of their own neighborhood, and they have taken that to heart,” Mr. Jordan said. “They know America will have their back.”Saudi Arabia also said Monday that it would “temporarily” close Yemen’s land, sea and air ports of entry in response to the missile firing, in order to tighten inspections and stop any weapons shipments. It pledged to provide for “the continuation of the entry and exit of humanitarian supplies and crews.”However, the United Nations said that two aid flights scheduled for Monday had not been allowed to depart for Yemen.“We’re trying to see whether we can get our normal access restored,” Farhan Haq, a United Nations spokesman, said at a daily briefing. “We underscored to all parties the need for regular humanitarian access.”The United Nations considers Yemen, the Middle East’s poorest country, one of the world’s biggest humanitarian emergencies. Roughly 17 million people — 60 percent of the population — need food assistance, and seven million are at risk of famine. Nearly 900,000 Yemenis have been sickened by cholera.Saudi Arabia accompanied its accusations against Iran with the announcement that it would pay bounties of up to $30 million for information leading to the capture of 40 Houthi leaders in Yemen.“We fear nothing,” one leader on the list, Mohammad Ali al-Houthi, said in a defiant speech on Monday in the Yemeni capital, Sana.He called the arrests ordered by Prince Mohammed “a coup leading to the throne” and invited any dissident Saudis to take refuge in Yemen. “We tell the citizens and princes in Saudi Arabia that the Yemeni people are opening their arms to you. None will endure injustice.”Yemen’s Houthi-controlled Defense Ministry said over the weekend that its forces had targeted Riyadh’s airport with a long-range missile. Immediately after the firing, the Saudi-led coalition hit Sana with the heaviest barrage of airstrikes in more than a year.With the support of Iran, the Houthis overthrew the internationally recognized government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi in early 2015, and they have controlled much of the country since.While the Houthis have long had loose ties to Iran and have received some support, there has never been proof that they were proxies under the direct command of Tehran, as the Saudis assert, analysts say. But the Saudi intervention appears to have unintentionally brought the Houthis and Iranians closer together, Mr. Jordan, the former ambassador, noted.The Saudi claim about Iran’s responsibility for the missile attack was difficult to evaluate in part because of the long and complicated history of illicit weapons shipments to Yemen.South Yemeni forces acquired Soviet missiles during their civil war with what was then North Yemen before it ended in 1994, and the subsequent national government of Yemen, whose institutions are now under the control of the Houthi faction, had said as long ago as 2002 that it had bought a shipment of Scud missiles from North Korea.State Department cables published by WikiLeaks indicate that Yemen had resumed buying North Korean missiles as recently as 2009. But the Houthi alliance with Iran makes it impossible to rule out the possibility that Tehran provided or procured the missiles, even if they were manufactured in North Korea.Analysts at IHS Jane’s say that it would be difficult for Iran to ship whole missiles to Yemen, but that the missiles could have been acquired from North Korea before the current conflict started.Riyadh has been attacked twice before with missiles from Yemen, in February and March. The Saudi border area, including military bases in the southern city of Jizan, has also been targeted several times.', 'Reza Zarrab Testifies That He Bribed Turkish Minister - The New York TimesA gaunt man in tan jail clothes took the witness stand Wednesday and began testifying about how he had bribed a Turkish economy minister as part of a billion-dollar scheme to smuggle gold for oil in violation of United States sanctions on Iran.The witness, Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, had been charged with conspiring to violate the sanctions and had faced a trial with Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an official with Halkbank, a Turkish state bank that prosecutors say was involved in the scheme.But last month, Mr. Zarrab secretly pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the authorities, a development revealed when Mr. Atilla’s trial opened in Federal District Court in Manhattan this week.As Mr. Zarrab testified against Mr. Atilla, he was asked by a prosecutor why he had decided to help the American authorities. He offered a pragmatic reason.“Cooperation was the fastest way to accept responsibility and to get out of jail at once,” he said.Mr. Zarrab is currently being held at an undisclosed location — in F.B.I. custody and not in a hotel, he told the court.“Are you free to come and go as you please?” the prosecutor, Sidhardha Kamaraju, asked.“Definitely not,” he said.The prosecution of Mr. Zarrab, Mr. Atilla and seven other people who remain at large — including the former economy minister, Zafer Caglayan — has sent tremors through Turkish political circles.Allegations that Mr. Caglayan had taken bribes surfaced in a 2013 Turkish police investigation, when Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was prime minister. A prosecutor told the jury on Tuesday that corrupt Turkish officials had shut down that inquiry, but that the F.B.I.’s own investigation “tells the same story” as the Turkish police found.Mr. Erdogan has bitterly condemned the new prosecution and sought to persuade American officials to drop it.Mr. Zarrab’s first day of testimony was focused on his decision to cooperate and on how he carried out the scheme. He said he had paid Mr. Caglayan tens of millions of dollars in bribes, and took the jury through accounting records that were displayed on a screen and listed the amounts and dates of the payments.Mr. Zarrab, 34, usually has a thick black beard but had shaved it for the trial. During the questioning, he appeared calm. He looked directly at the prosecutor, answering his questions through an interpreter in a polite tone and with an earnest manner.He became more animated when describing the methods he had used to get around the sanctions, gesturing and blinking rapidly as he explained how he had transferred gold and money.When Mr. Kamaraju asked him to step down from the witness stand and draw diagrams on white poster board to show how his scheme worked, Mr. Zarrab almost resembled a business-school lecturer, sketching lines and boxes with colored markers and explaining as he went.“In other words, the blue and the red lines would merge here,” he told the jury.After he had finished, the judge, Richard M. Berman, asked him approximately how many separate transactions he had drawn on his last diagram “to get the money from where it couldn’t leave to where it could leave.”After counting, Mr. Zarrab declared, “A minimum of 10.”Only occasionally did he appear slightly uncomfortable, shuffling in his chair and taking a sip of water as he identified the defendant, Mr. Atilla, 47, who was seated at the defense table.Mr. Kamaraju also asked whether Mr. Zarrab had hired lawyers to explore whether he could be released as part of a prisoner exchange.“Within the legal limits, yes, of course,” Mr. Zarrab said.The reference was apparently to Mr. Zarrab’s decision to retain Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and an informal adviser to President Trump, and Michael B. Mukasey, a former United States attorney general, to try to negotiate a diplomatic resolution to his case.The lawyers met with President Erdogan and talked with senior Trump administration officials.“Were they successful?” Mr. Kamaraju asked.“No,” Mr. Zarrab replied.By the end of the day in Turkey, and more than four hours after Mr. Zarrab testified about bribing Mr. Caglayan, neither the Turkish state broadcaster nor the news agency had reported on the testimony.Yet Twitter was abuzz with tens of thousands of Turks following live feeds from other news outlets, such as BBC Turkish and other independent news sites, causing “Zafer Caglayan” to become a worldwide Twitter trending topic.', 'Mr. Trump Squanders the World’s Trust - The New York TimesAt a crucial moment, Donald Trump is forcing the world to confront core questions it really shouldn’t have to ask: Can he be trusted? And, more saliently, can America be trusted? His threats to jettison the Iran nuclear deal are undermining America’s credibility as a negotiating partner and weakening America’s ability to lead the free world as it has for 70 years.In his rush to bulldoze President Obama’s accomplishments, Mr. Trump has withdrawn from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, leaving China with a freer hand to set trade rules in Asia; abandoned the hard-won 195-nation Paris Agreement to address climate change; and sowed grave doubts about his commitment to NATO, the bedrock alliance that has kept peace in Europe after World War II.Now, Mr. Trump is threatening to torpedo the 2015 nuclear deal, which imposed strict limits on Iran’s nuclear program in return for a lifting of international sanctions. He has hinted that next month he will not certify that Iran is complying with its commitments, even though the head of America’s Strategic Command just said that it was. The certification is required every 90 days; a failure to provide it could lead to the re-imposition of American sanctions and cause the agreement to unravel.Perhaps the most immediate consequence of reneging on the Iran deal is that it will make it even harder, if not impossible, for the president to negotiate a peaceful resolution of the crisis over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. The North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, is erratic and frightening, but why would it help matters to eliminate any confidence Mr. Kim might have in Mr. Trump’s word?Such a reckless choice on the Iran deal would also free Iran to resume unfettered nuclear activities and constitute a slap in the face to major powers — Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China — that worked with the United States and Iran for two years to negotiate and implement the deal. Those nations are now feverishly trying to persuade Mr. Trump to stick with America’s commitment.It would be one thing if Iran had violated the agreement, but the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the nuclear program 24/7, has repeatedly confirmed Iran’s compliance. Mr. Trump didn’t even bother to try to make a case against Iran when he lashed out at it during a speech at the United Nations General Assembly last week.One unanswered question is whether the United States would be violating international law if it reimposed sanctions on Iran without cause or otherwise undermined the agreement. In the United States, most legally binding international agreements take the form of treaties, which require approval by two-thirds of the Senate, and executive agreements, which are entered into by the executive branch and don’t require Senate action. The Iran deal is a political commitment that is not legally binding, though some experts believe that the United States has an obligation to comply since the deal was codified in a United Nations Security Council resolution.While Mr. Trump’s Republican and Democratic predecessors often pursued significantly different domestic policies, on the whole their foreign policies did not radically diverge from administration to administration. And for good reason: America and its leaders, whatever their failings, have largely taken their international responsibilities seriously and found value and security in adhering to laws, legal obligations and political commitments that reassure allies, constrain enemies, advance stability and promote democracy and human rights. If he shrugs off previous commitments without clear cause, Mr. Trump may find that world leaders will start to wonder if his successors will treat his deals as indifferently as he is treating his predecessors’.The issue is not that presidents don’t sometimes renege on predecessors’ agreements. In 2002, President George W. Bush abandoned the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. While that was an unwise move that stoked Russian suspicions about the West, Mr. Bush was not acting capriciously. He relied upon the treaty’s agreed-upon withdrawal clause and had a strategy for improving relations with Russia going forward.President Ronald Reagan called the SALT II arms control treaty “fatally flawed,” yet he found a way to live with it as part of a strategy that used an arms buildup to pressure the Soviets.A bellicose stance toward Iran is just one part of the incoherent and inconsistent foreign policy that Mr. Trump described to the United Nations General Assembly. He elevated “sovereignty” as his guiding principle for international relations and used it as a rationale for threatening Iran, North Korea and Venezuela, then gave kid glove treatment to Russia — which has not only seized territory from Ukraine but has also sought to undermine America’s own sovereignty — and China, which has expanded its territorial claims in the South China Sea.Given the standard that Mr. Trump is setting for foreign policy reversals, his own decisions could eventually be overturned by his successor. But the damage to America’s standing as a trusted, reliable partner won’t be so easily repaired.', '', 'Trump to Force Congress to Act on Iran Nuclear Deal - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to overrule his top national security advisers and decline to certify the Iran nuclear agreement, according to people who have been briefed on the matter, a decision that would reopen a volatile political debate on Iran but is likely to leave in place the landmark deal negotiated by the Obama administration.By declining to certify Iran’s compliance, Mr. Trump would essentially kick it to Congress to decide whether to reimpose punitive economic sanctions. Even among Republicans, there appears to be little appetite to do that, at least for now.Still, Mr. Trump’s expected move would allow him to tell supporters that he had disavowed the accord, while bowing to the reality that the United States would isolate itself from its allies if it sabotaged a deal with which Iran is viewed as complying. Mr. Trump repeatedly ridiculed the accord during the 2016 presidential campaign, vowing to rip it up.White House officials cautioned that the president had not yet formally decided to “decertify” the agreement. But he faces an Oct. 15 deadline, and he has made little secret of his intentions, most recently when he declared at the United Nations two weeks ago that the agreement was “embarrassing to the United States.”Mr. Trump will present his decision on the deal as part of a broader American strategy to crack down on Iran for its ballistic missile program and destabilizing actions throughout the Middle East. Administration officials said he had signed off on the overall approach and hoped he would present it before the deadline.The strategy is an effort by the Trump administration to make the nuclear agreement only part of a multidimensional approach to pressure Iran on many fronts, including its missile program, its support for militant groups like Hezbollah and its intervention in the Syrian civil war on behalf of the Assad government.But the administration has yet to articulate that broader strategy. As a result, the nuclear deal remains the fulcrum of the relationship with Iran — and a political football in Washington.Congress will have to decide whether to reimpose sanctions, which could sink the deal, or use the prospect of that to force Iran — and the other parties to the deal — back to the negotiating table to make changes in the agreement.That is the approach favored by Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, who has emerged as a leading hard-liner on Iran and is working closely with the White House to devise its strategy. On Thursday, Mr. Cotton met with Mr. Trump to discuss Iran and other issues.“Congress and the president, working together, should lay out how the deal must change and, if it doesn’t, the consequences Iran will face,” Mr. Cotton said in a speech on Tuesday at the Council on Foreign Relations. Reimposing sanctions, he said, would be a “backward-looking step.”Mr. Cotton said the United States and its allies should demand three changes to the deal: an elimination of “sunset clauses,” under which restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities are phased out in less than 14 years; a strengthening of international inspections of Iran’s nuclear facilities; and a curbing the country’s ballistic and cruise-missile programs.Democrats argue that Mr. Trump should certify the agreement, warning that the administration’s ability to press Iran on other activities it objects to would be compromised — rather than enhanced — if the United States threw the future of the agreement into question.Britain, France and Germany, all signatories to the agreement, are watching Mr. Trump’s deliberations with deepening concern. Diplomats from the three countries, as well as from the European Union, met with dozens of senators this week to warn them that if the United States withdrew, Europe would not follow.“For us, this is a high priority in our national security,” said Peter Wittig, Germany’s ambassador to Washington. “We will stand by the Iran deal, and we want you not to walk away, but to comply with it. We share some of the grievances you have about Iran, and we can talk about it — and we should talk about it — but only on the basis of sticking to the deal.”The deal is also contentious inside the administration. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis have both urged Mr. Trump not to back out of it, in part because that would free Iran to begin producing uranium and reprocessing plutonium immediately, not after 13 years, as is stipulated in the agreement.But Mr. Trump, after twice certifying the deal, has warned his aides that he would not do so again. As a result, the administration is looking for ways to claim Iran is in violation of the “spirit” of the accord, even if it has complied with inspection criteria. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that Iran was in compliance; when it has found minor violations, they have been quickly fixed.The president could also decline to certify it by claiming that the deal is simply not in the national security interests of the United States.While the White House said that Mr. Trump had not formally signed a decision memo on the certification issue, he tipped his hand in mid-September with a less heralded, but in many ways more important, decision. At that time, facing another congressionally imposed deadline, he agreed to renew an exemption on sanctions on Iran.Mr. Trump said nothing about that decision, which he came to reluctantly in a series of National Security Council meetings.Declining to recertify Iran’s compliance would amount to a compromise. Because it is simply a notification from the White House to Congress, it has no legal effect by itself. Mr. Trump could tell his supporters that he broke with President Barack Obama on the deal, without actually violating its terms.“It appears to be part of a ‘have your cake and eat it too’ strategy by the administration,” said Philip H. Gordon, who coordinated Middle East policy in the National Security Council during the Obama administration.The risk, Mr. Gordon said, is that “while the administration may hope Congress refrains from passing new sanctions that cause the nuclear deal to collapse, no one can guarantee that outcome.” He noted that every Republican member of Congress voted against the deal.The larger question is whether Mr. Trump’s “decertification” would gradually strangle the bigger goals of the nuclear negotiation: To integrate Iran with Western economies while assuring it cannot build a nuclear weapon for more than a decade.If the Trump administration’s actions makes European banks fearful of lending billions to Iran to build new refineries, or expand other economic links with the West, it may fuel opposition to the deal inside Iran.For its part, Iran has warned it would refuse to renegotiate the deal, or even talk about extending its length or conditions, unless the United States was also ready to make concessions on parts of the deal that have left it unhappy. While Mr. Trump argues that the United States paid too much up front in the deal to Iran, the Iranians reply that they were the ones who gave up most of their nuclear material before the arrangement went into effect.“Are you prepared to return to us 10 tons of enriched uranium?” Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, asked in an interview in New York in late September, referring to the stockpile of nuclear material — about 98 percent of the country’s nuclear fuel holdings — that Iran shipped out of the country in the opening moments of the accord.', 'How World Leaders Reacted to Trump at the U.N. - The New York TimesHe was called a “giant gold Goliath” and a “rogue newcomer.” But in a few corners the remarks made by President Trump at the United Nations were described as “courageous” and “gratifying.”Throughout the week, Mr. Trump’s first address to the General Assembly drew many direct and indirect swipes, from allies and rivals alike, and sparse support.While the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, attacked Mr. Trump from afar — calling him a “dotard” in a statement on North Korean national television — others used their platforms at the United Nations to respond.Some leaders were more subtle than others.Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe’s 93-year-old president, took aim at Mr. Trump during his own speech on Thursday. Mr. Mugabe mocked Mr. Trump as a “giant gold Goliath” and said other nations were “embarrassed if not frightened” by his statements about North Korea.“Are we having a return of Goliath to our midst, who threatens the extinction of other countries?” Mr. Mugabe asked. Some responded with applause to his reference to the biblical character who threatened the Israelites before being slain by the young shepherd David, who would become king.Mr. Mugabe then went on to address Mr. Trump directly, telling him to “blow your trumpet in a musical way towards the values of unity, peace, cooperation, togetherness and dialogue which we have always stood for.”During his speech, Mr. Trump notably omitted any talk of climate change, seen as one of the most pressing issues for many world leaders.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada received the longest applause during his General Assembly speech on Thursday after an implicit dig at Mr. Trump.“There is no country on the planet that can walk away from the challenge and reality of climate change,” Mr. Trudeau said, referring to Mr. Trump’s plans to pull out of the Paris climate accord.Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, was quick to embrace Mr. Trump’s paean to sovereignty.“It is gratifying to note, as the U.S. President Donald Trump unequivocally stated from this podium last Tuesday, that it is important to comply with the principles of sovereignty in international affairs,” Mr. Lavrov said during his General Assembly speech on Thursday.“I believe that anyone can sign on to these words,” he added.But Mr. Lavrov was also critical of Mr. Trump’s policies on Iran, saying the “world is watching with alarm as the U.S. imposes yet a new set of restrictions against Iran.”Sigmar Gabriel, the German foreign minister, delivered one of the toughest rebukes from a longtime American ally. Taking aim at Mr. Trump’s focus on sovereignty, he denounced the “national egoism” of his speech.“The motto ‘Our Country First’ not only leads to more national confrontations and less prosperity, in the end, there will only be losers,” Mr. Gabriel said Thursday.“This worldview describes the world as an arena, a kind of battleground, in which everyone is fighting against everyone else and in which everyone has to assert their own interests, either alone or in alliances of convenience,” Mr. Gabriel said. “In this worldview, the law of the strongest prevails, not the strength of the law.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel praised Mr. Trump’s speech in a series of Twitter messages sent shortly after the address.“President Trump spoke the truth about the great dangers facing our world and issued a powerful call to confront them in order to ensure the future of humanity,” Mr. Netanyahu wrote Tuesday.He also applauded Mr. Trump’s criticism of the Iran nuclear deal, an agreement that Israel has opposed from the beginning.Later in the day, Mr. Netanyahu echoed the sentiments in his own speech to the assembly.“I’ve listened to countless speeches in this hall, but I can say this: None were bolder, none more courageous and forthright than the one delivered by President Trump today,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “President Trump rightly called the nuclear deal with Iran, he called it an embarrassment.”President Hassan Rouhani of Iran did not hold back when it was his turn on the podium. While Mr. Rouhani did not mentioned the American president by name, he took clear aim at Mr. Trump on Wednesday.“It will be a great pity if this agreement were to be destroyed by rogue newcomers to the world of politics,” Mr. Rouhani said, referring to the nuclear accord between his country and six world powers. Mr. Trump had assailed the deal as “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.”Mr. Rouhani praised the agreement as a “model” and pledged that Iran would not be the first to violate it.About an hour later, he held an hourlong news conference, in which he demanded an apology from Mr. Trump for what he called “completely baseless allegations” about Iran.', "The president demanded the rogue regime give up its nuclear program and ripped Tehran for seeking to destabilize an entire region; John Roberts has the roundup for 'Special Report'There’s a pitched rhetorical battle underway right now in Washington as an October 15 deadline approaches for President Trump to certify to Congress that the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran (the JCPOA) is in the national interests of the United States and that Iran is in compliance. Although the president said last week he has made his decision, backers and opponents of the agreement are working overtime to convince him to adopt their recommendations.President Trump has been highly critical of the JCPOA, calling it “the worst deal ever” during the presidential campaign and “an embarrassment to the United States” during his speech to the UN General Assembly on Sept. 19.However, the president reluctantly certified the nuclear deal to Congress twice this year due to heavy pressure from his top national security advisers, especially Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. After a heated discussion with his advisers, Mr Trump made the last certification in July but indicated he did not plan to do so again.A few months ago, Tillerson, McMaster and other advisers were telling President Trump he had no choice but to certify the JCPOA because Iran was in compliance and any violations were “not material.” Many disagreed, including Senators Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Ted Cruz, R-Texas, David Perdue, R-Ga., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who spelled out major instances of Iranian noncompliance and cheating in a July 11, 2017 letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.As the 45 experts said in their letter to President Trump, “It is time to move beyond President Obama’s appeasement of Iran and to begin work on a comprehensive new approach that fully addresses the menace that the Iranian regime increasingly poses to American and international security.” But the main argument Trump advisers made to certify the Iran deal was that if America withdrew it would alienate European leaders.Now, with the president reportedly determined to “decertify,” Tillerson, McMaster and others who oppose a U.S. withdrawal have shifted gears. They have intensified their criticism of the Iran deal as deeply flawed and are proposing the president not certify but remain a party to the deal to fix it later. In addition, they are calling for the JCPOA be sent to Congress for it to impose more sanctions.This supposed middle-ground option would allow President Trump to give a tough-sounding speech lashing out at the JCPOA and demanding major changes. But Iran has made it clear that it will never agree to alter the agreement and Congressional Democrats are certain to filibuster any sanctions legislation that would kill the deal. As a result, the “decertify but remain in the deal” option is actually a clever ploy to ensure the U.S. never withdraws from the nuclear deal.Ambassador John Bolton has a far better and more honest option: a clean withdrawal implementing a comprehensive strategy with America’s allies – including Israel – that addresses the full range of threats posed by Iran.Bolton was tasked to write a plan to do this by former Trump Chief Strategist Steve Bannon in response to the president’s request last July for a policy option to withdraw from the Iran deal. Worried that the Bolton plan could sway Mr. Trump, senior Trump officials have blocked Bolton from meeting with the president. Bolton therefore published his “Iran Deal Exit Strategy” in National Review on August 28.Bolton’s plan has not received a lot of media coverage because senior Trump officials – especially McMaster – have been aggressively working with the press to promote the “decertify but remain in the deal” option. However, the Bolton plan received a huge boost last week when 45 national security experts sent a letter to President Trump urging him to withdraw from the JCPOA using Bolton’s strategy.The letter’s signatories included many leading experts in arms control and nuclear nonproliferation such as former Director of Sandia National Laboratory Paul Robinson, former Under Secretary of State for Arms Control Robert Joseph; former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith; former Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Gen. William Boykin and dozens of other former State and Defense Department officials.The proposal being advanced by McMaster, Tillerson and others -- that President Trump keep the United States in the JCPOA but not certify to Congress that it is in our national security interests -- is absurd, especially after the president called the agreement an embarrassment to the United States. This option will ensure that this dangerous agreement continues as is and will undermine Mr. Trump’s credibility with the American people and the world.As the 45 experts said in their letter to President Trump, “It is time to move beyond President Obama’s appeasement of Iran and to begin work on a comprehensive new approach that fully addresses the menace that the Iranian regime increasingly poses to American and international security.” President Trump should do this by implementing a clean withdrawal from the fraudulent Iran nuclear deal using the plan drafted by Ambassador Bolton.Fred Fleitz is senior vice president for policy and programs with the Center for Security Policy, a national security think tank.

They are also working with North Korea. Not much of an agreement we have!”This was after Trump, speaking before world leaders at the United Nations, called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” to the United States. “We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program,” he said.Trump later told reporters he had made up his mind about the deal, but wouldn\'t say whether he would pull the United States out of the nuclear accord with Iran.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, speaking at the U.N. one day after Trump, maintained his country’s missile program was “solely defensive” in nature.“We never threaten anyone, but we do not tolerate threats from anyone,” he said. Rouhani returned to Tehran two days later to preside over the missile parade featuring the new medium-range design and said his country would build as many missiles as necessary to defend itself. Afterward, the footage was aired, with Iranian media claiming a successful test launch – though it apparently showed the failed January launch.Video: #Iran successfully test-fires new ballistic missileDetails: https://t.co/eKHi0jXnED pic.twitter.com/30XkB8ddbPAt the time, Iran was attempting to launch its new Khorramshahr medium-range ballistic missile for the first time.It flew 600 miles before exploding, in a failed test of a reentry vehicle, officials said at the time.The failed late January launch was first reported by Fox News and prompted the White House to put Iran “on notice” days later.Iran’s new medium-range missile is based on a North Korean design—Pyongyang’s BM-25 Musudan ballistic missile, which has a maximum range of nearly 2,500 miles, putting U.S. forces in the Middle East and Israel within reach if its problems are fixed.“The very first missiles we saw in Iran were simply copies of North Korean missiles,” said Jeffrey Lewis, a missile proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. “Over the years, we\'ve seen photographs of North Korean and Iranian officials in each other\'s countries, and we\'ve seen all kinds of common hardware.” Last weekend, a senior Iranian general said the missile had a range of less than 2,000 miles."The Khoramshahr missile has a range of 2,000 kilometers [1,250 miles]and can carry multiple warheads," Iran’s official IRNA news agency quoted Revolutionary Guards aerospace chief General Amir Ali Hajizadeh as saying.“I am not sure why the Iranians are lying about the range,” one U.S. official said. “I think they don’t want to piss the Europeans off.”The official and others declined to be identified because they were not authorized to disclose sensitive information to the press.Experts say Iran possesses the largest arsenal of ballistic missiles in the Middle East, with more than 1,000 short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Tehran has conducted over 20 missile tests since 2015.According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Iran is “supplying proxies such as Hezbollah and Syria’s al-Assad regime with a steady supply of missiles and rockets” and “likely supplying Houthi rebel groups with short-range missiles in the ongoing conflict in Yemen.”U.N. resolution 2231 -- put in place days after the Iran nuclear deal was signed -- calls on the Islamic Republic not to conduct ballistic missile tests, but does not forbid them from doing so, after Russia and China insisted on the watered-down language in order to pass the resolution.Iran is "called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology," according to the text of the resolution.Iran claims the tests are legitimate because they are defensive in nature.

You will be hearing about Iran very shortly,” he added.At the same time, North Korea continues to develop its nuclear program, posing a threat to its immediate neighbors -- and to the U.S., which it has tormented with defiant rhetoric.

And Why Does Trump Hate It? - The New York TimesPresident Trump announced that he would decertify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement reached with six world powers, including the United States.Mr. Trump did not immediately pull out of the accord. He essentially deferred to Congress a decision about whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran, which could destroy the agreement. And he added an ultimatum, declaring that if the agreement were not renegotiated to permanently stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, he would terminate it at some point in the future.Here are some questions and answers about the agreement and the possible consequences. Which countries negotiated the agreement and what did it accomplish?The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — plus Germany, known as the P5-plus-1 group, negotiated the agreement with Iran. Disarmament advocates consider it a major achievement of the Obama administration, averting a possible military conflict with Iran and a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.The agreement severely limited Iran’s ability to enrich uranium fuel and other activities necessary to make nuclear weapons. While Iran has repeatedly promised that it would never seek nuclear weapons, the agreement provided verifiable assurances for the first time.In return, a wide array of economic penalties that had been imposed on Iran were rescinded or suspended, including many American sanctions and a European oil embargo that had weakened the Iranian economy.Why has Mr. Trump called it the “worst deal” and an “embarrassment”?He has argued that the Obama administration focused on Iran’s nuclear program while giving insufficient attention to many other of Iran’s activities, including its support for President Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria, its intervention in the Yemeni civil war and the role of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in disrupting the region.Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the White House said on Friday, the United States had “consistently prioritized the immediate threat of Sunni extremist organizations over the longer-term threat of Iranian-backed militancy.” Like many of his predecessors, Mr. Trump has favored Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Muslim allies in the region over Iran, the world’s dominant Shiite Muslim power.Even on nuclear issues, Mr. Trump says, the deal didn’t go far enough, because it does not permanently stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and because it does not include restrictions on missile testing. He also says that inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations body that oversees compliance with the agreement, have insufficient monitoring powers.And Mr. Trump has criticized the release of billions of dollars in impounded Iranian money, describing it as a giveaway that has reduced American leverage.How have other American politicians responded to Mr. Trump’s complaints?A number of anti-Iran voices agree with Mr. Trump. But while many critics of Iran in the United States, both Democrats and Republicans, agree that the agreement has flaws, they also say it is better than nothing. Others fear the United States will lose international credibility and alienate European allies by renouncing or undermining the deal.They also point out that despite Mr. Trump’s denunciations, the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly found that Iran is complying.All the other parties to the agreement contend that it is working, and some of Mr. Trump’s own advisers counseled him that it was in the interest of national security.Why does Mr. Trump remain so hostile toward the agreement?He pledged during the 2016 election campaign to scrap or renegotiate the agreement, which he said had weakened American security and appeased a longtime enemy of the United States and Israel. Moreover, under an American law, he had to certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran was complying, creating a politically uncomfortable quandary for him four times a year.Mr. Trump’s formal step of decertifying Iran gives lawmakers 60 days to decide whether to reimpose nuclear sanctions — effectively throwing responsibility for the agreement’s fate to Congress.Does that mean decertification kills the deal?No — or at least not necessarily. Iranian officials have suggested that they regard decertification to be an internal American political matter, as long as it does not lead to reimposed sanctions.Would reimposed sanctions kill it?Iranian officials have strongly suggested that they would abandon the agreement, or at least no longer feel bound by its nuclear limitations.At the same time, the Iranian government remains extremely reluctant to take such a step because it could jeopardize the economic relationships it has developed or revived with other parties to the accord, most notably in France and Germany.Preservation of the agreement also keeps alive the prospect that Iran can purchase billions of dollars worth of Boeing and Airbus aircraft it has ordered under a provision of the accord that permitted such transactions.Why can’t the agreement be renegotiated?It may be possible, but Iran’s leaders have ridiculed the idea. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran, who led the Iranian team that reached the deal in 2015, told The New York Times in an interview that the United States wanted to renegotiate only the provisions it disliked. And if the United States withdrew from the agreement, he said, “Who would come and listen to you anymore?”', "BEIRUT – The abrupt resignation of Lebanon's prime minister was bizarre even by the often twisted standards of the country's politics.Saad Hariri made the announcement from the Saudi capital in a pre-recorded message on a Saudi-owned TV station. Stunned Lebanese are convinced Saudi Arabia, Hariri's longtime ally, forced him to take the step, which effectively wrecks the prime minister's delicate compromise government with Saudi nemesis and Iran ally, the Hezbollah militant group.In doing so, the kingdom throws Lebanon into potential turmoil. It forces the small nation to become a new front in the regional fight for supremacy between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Iran supports the Houthis but has denied Saudi and U.S. allegations that it has given them missiles and other weapons.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, home to Dubai, are close allies and have been battling the Houthis since March 2015.Iran has a long history of shutting down local media over security charges.', 'Trump Alienates America’s Allies and Hands Iran a Victory - The New York TimesFor months, President Trump has made no secret of his desire to tear up one of the Obama administration’s top national security achievements: the nuclear accord with Iran, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A.Mr. Trump repeatedly bashed the agreement during last year’s campaign. Once in the White House, American law required the president to certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran was complying. Even Mr. Trump’s adversarial relationship with the truth could not dodge the fact that Iran is in compliance — as determined repeatedly by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the American intelligence community and our closest European allies. Mr. Trump has found it galling to certify — not once, but twice — that a deal he described as “the worst ever” and “an embarrassment” is working.So, the only remaining question was how Mr. Trump would justify pulling out. Now we know. In a tortured statement at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump laid out a long litany of Iranian misdeeds, from the 1979 hostage crisis to today, as the predicate for the need to deny the government in Tehran access to nuclear weapons. This presented the president with a logical dilemma, since that is exactly what the nuclear deal accomplishes, well into the future. To overcome it, Mr. Trump waxed disingenuous about the deal — weaving together misstatements, exaggerations and distortions — to trigger the one totally subjective standard for decertification in the 90-day review law: an assertion that the nuclear steps Iran is actually taking to implement the J.C.P.O.A. are insufficient to warrant the suspension of sanctions.Mr. Trump’s false narrative began with a whopper: that the Obama administration lifted sanctions “just before what would have been the total collapse of the Iranian regime” — an assertion wishful thinkers in Washington have been making every year for the past four decades. To the contrary, while sanctions succeeded in bending the regime enough to get it back to the negotiating table, it had become clear they could not break it.The Iranian regime is nothing if not resilient. It fought an eight-year-long war with Iraq to a draw despite losing hundreds of thousands of lives; it has survived decades of isolation.Meanwhile, Tehran had invested its national pride and an estimated $100 billion in its nuclear program. The regime was not about to give up on those investments, even though international sanctions painstakingly built by the Obama administration cost it some $150 billion. In fact, at the time the nuclear deal was negotiated, Iran was on the threshold of becoming a nuclear state with the ability to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a weapon in a matter of weeks. The J.C.P.O.A. pushed that “breakout time” to more than a year.Next, Mr. Trump trotted out the canard that the deal gave Iran “over $100 billion its government could use to fund terrorism.” Never mind that the money in question is actually Iran’s — the proceeds from oil sales that countries around the world froze in bank accounts at the United States’ behest — or that virtually all of it is being dedicated to unmet domestic needs, to pay off debts and to prop up Iran’s currency.As to Iran’s nuclear obligations under the agreement, Mr. Trump asserted that “we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran’s path to a bomb.” This will be news to the I.A.E.A., which now benefits from the most intrusive and transparent inspection and monitoring regime ever devised. Its major provisions last 20 to 25 years, and under the Additional Protocol that Iran is obliged to adopt under the agreement, the I.A.E.A. will have the right to access declared and undeclared sites in perpetuity, including Iran’s military facilities.And that “short term” delay in Iran’s race to a bomb? Mr. Trump ignored the fact that while certain constraints on Iran’s enrichment capacity go away in 10 or 15 years, it is permanently barred under the Non-Proliferation Treaty from acquiring a nuclear weapon or doing weapons-related work. If Iran nonetheless moves in that direction, thanks to the inspection regime a future president will have a much greater likelihood of seeing it and a united international community to confront it — both of which the United States will lose if it reneges on the deal.Now that Mr. Trump has decertified Iran’s compliance with the nuclear agreement, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. Mr. Trump called on Congress and America’s allies to use the time “to address the deal’s many serious flaws.” If not, he said, “the agreement will be terminated.”By “fix” Mr. Trump means legislation to impose new conditions on Iran beyond the purview of the agreement and to extend its constraints indefinitely. That would put the United States, not Iran, in violation of the agreement and isolate Washington, not Tehran, around the world. It would allow Iran to resume its pursuit of nuclear weapons or to stick with the deal for its economic benefits, forcing the United States to sanction its closest allies for doing business with Tehran. It would provide a “we told you so” gift to Iranian hard-liners in their struggle with pragmatists. It would shackle, not advance, Mr. Trump’s ability to sign others on to his broader strategy to confront Iranian aggression. More broadly, it would undermine America’s credibility — and its ability to strike agreements that make the country safer in the future.Congress must resist the temptation — and the political pressure — to unilaterally renegotiate the Iran deal and therefore kill it. Instead, it could usefully lay out what Mr. Trump’s speech did not: an actual comprehensive strategy to contend with Iran’s non-nuclear behavior, including diplomatic efforts to end the conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Iraq that Iran exploits; stronger security cooperation with the Gulf States and Israel; better coordination with America’s allies; and targeted sanctions on Iran that do not violate the nuclear accord. Unlike Mr. Trump’s decision to decertify Iran, that would be a real contribution to America’s security.', '                                    Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iran\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was the "new Hitler of the Middle East."

Salman told The Times that Iran\'s efforts to expand “needed to be confronted."The prince, 32, who is expected to succeed his father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, 81, compared Iran and Saudi Arabia’s power struggle in the region to those fighting for Europe in World War II.“But we learned from Europe that appeasement doesn’t work. We don’t want the new Hitler in Iran to repeat what happened in Europe in the Middle East,” Salman told The New York Times.RETURNING PM ATTENDS LEBANON’S MILITARY PARADEThe Islamic Republic and Saudi Arabia support rival sides in the various wars and political battles occurring throughout the region. Saudi Arabia backs Sunni Muslims while Tehran backs Shiite Muslims.Tensions between the two countries escalated earlier this month when Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced in Saudi Arabia that he was resigning from his position. Hariri accused Iran-backed Hezbollah, a Shiite political party and terror group based in Lebanon, of holding his country hostage and plotting against him. Saudi Arabia has also accused Hezbollah of meddling on Iran’s behalf in regional affairs.Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said earlier this month he was resigning from his position.(AP)Hezbollah, however, accused Saudi Arabia of engineering Hariri’s resignation, calling it “an act of war,” Reuters reported.Hariri returned to Lebanon this week and said he was putting his resignation on hold.UN CHIEF NUKE INSPECTOR: IRAN COMPLYING WITH NUCLEAR DEALSalmanalso told The New York Times the war in Yemen was “going in its favor.” The war, which has raged since 2015, has pitted a Saudi-led coalition backed by the U.S. against the Houthi rebels and forces loyal to Yemen’s ousted president. The war has left over 10,000 people dead, driven 3 million from their homes and destroyed the country’s already fragile infrastructure.Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of sending aid to the Houthi rebels in Yemen while Tehran has denied the accusations, the BBC reported.Iran did not immediately responded to Salman’s comments but Khamenei has previously called Saudi Arabia’s royal family, the House of Saud, an “accursed tree” and accused the kingdom of “spreading terrorism.”A November crackdown saw the arrests of 11 members of the House of Saud on various charges related to "corruption." In the midst of the arrests and constant countering of Iran, Saudi Arabia has also worked to institute reforms such as allowing women to drive vehicles in the Kingdom.The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'Saudi Arabia Has No Idea How to Deal With Iran - The New York TimesFew things are as explosive as the combination of power, ambition and anxiety — and there is plenty of all three in Riyadh these days.Once a cautious and passive regional power, Saudi Arabia has found a new purpose in recent years. The ruthless ambition of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in full display at home with his crackdown on businessmen and members of the royal family, also radiates across the Middle East, driven by the urgency to check Iranian influence. Prince Mohammed has a point. Iran is set on becoming the dominant power from Iraq to Lebanon.Saudi Arabia may exaggerate Iranian intentions and power, but Western and Asian countries typically understate them. The Iranians themselves are clear about how they view the region: “Is it possible to make any important decisions on Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, North Africa and the Persian Gulf region without Iran or Iran’s opinion?” Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, boasted last month. Tehran may not be in full control in Baghdad, Damascus and Beirut, but thanks to its proxies and allies, it can decisively shape their battlefields and politics.Given these circumstances, Prince Mohammed has good reason to question the value of his predecessors’ risk aversion on foreign policy. Under previous kings, Riyadh was indeed keen to reach out to Tehran despite provocative Iranian actions, including fast-tracking its nuclear program just as King Abdullah courted Presidents Akbar Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami, and plotting to assassinate a Saudi ambassador in the United States.Now Saudi foreign and security policy has gone into overdrive. Rather than carefully pushing back Iran and enrolling broad support for this effort, the approach has been haphazard, unsettling and counterproductive — and Iran remains one step ahead.Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen, on behalf of the government forces fighting against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels has been costly and inconclusive, even after more than two and a half years. In fact, it could lead to the very outcome that Riyadh most wanted to prevent: the transformation of the Houthi movement into something akin to Lebanon’s Hezbollah — except much closer to Saudi borders. Indeed, unless the war in Yemen comes to an end soon, those well-armed, Iran-backed militants will soon sit atop a shattered state and a starved society.The Saudi-led blockade of Qatar has been more successful. The effort to tame that country’s assertive regional policies has worked and the crisis has now been put on the back burner of international diplomacy. That said, the reputational cost has been high for all: A dispute framed by the Saudis as a struggle for the future of the Middle East is seen in many capitals as an unnecessary and disruptive clash of wealthy royals.The latest Saudi venture — the forced resignation as prime minister of Lebanon and probable house arrest of Saad Hariri, once a favorite ally of Riyadh — has bewildered many in Lebanon and elsewhere. It is also likely to backfire. This move plays into the hands of Iran and Hezbollah, who duplicitously pose as rule abiding, despite having undermined the Lebanese state for decades, assassinating rivals, plunging the country into foreign wars and exporting fighters across the region. In contrast, Saudi Arabia was backing state institutions and working through established politicians like Mr. Hariri. What Riyadh has now in mind — and in store — for Lebanon is unclear.In fact, if its goal is to counter Iran, Riyadh is picking the wrong battlefields.Lebanon and Yemen are peripheral countries, where wars are costly and complex, outcomes ambiguous and returns low. In the Middle East, the balance of power is determined in Syria and Iraq. But in those countries, the costs are high and the risks even higher. And in both places, Iran is well ahead.In 2011, Riyadh reasoned that sponsoring the Syrian rebellion would help compensate for Iran’s dominance in Iraq. It hasn’t worked that way. The faltering Syrian insurgency cannot be revived, the United States has basically washed its hands of the Syrian civil war, and the country’s future is being decided in Moscow, Ankara and Tehran.Perhaps better news for the Saudis is in Iraq, where they are making a late comeback after denying the new political realities since 2003. The courting of Moktada al-Sadr, a firebrand cleric turned a populist critic of Iran’s role in Iraq, and the embrace of Haider al-Abadi, the Iraqi prime minister, are spectacular yet tentative moves to balance Tehran’s influence.Riyadh has learned the hard way that regional alliances, cultivated at great cost, don’t necessarily deliver the expected political and military benefits. The Saudis have propped up the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Egypt with billions of dollars, yet Mr. Sisi is now resuming relations with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and rejecting Saudi pressure to escalate tensions with Iran. Mr. Sisi has also declined Saudi requests to send troops to Yemen to fight against the Houthis.A notable success for Saudi Arabia has been the realignment of American and Saudi policies, which is why President Trump has been welcomed so theatrically in the kingdom. Riyadh has been traumatized by its experience with the Obama administration, in particular President Obama’s unreciprocated eagerness to repair relations with Tehran and teach Iran and Saudi Arabia to “share” the Middle East.Riyadh and Washington undeniably converge right now when it comes to Iran but that does not amount to a common strategy. Indeed, President Trump, Jared Kushner and Prince Mohammed seem to mistake presidential and princely preference and mutual agreement for statecraft and implementation.Fundamentally, who prevails in the rivalry between Tehran and Riyadh comes down to capacity and competence. Iran has the networks, expertise, experience and strategic patience required to fight and win proxy wars at low cost and with plenty of disingenuous deniability. The Saudis simply don’t, which is why seeking to beat the Iranians at this game is dangerous and costly.Iran has another strength: It has demonstrated that it will be there for its friends and allies in good and bad times. Saudi Arabia does not have the same constancy. Just ask Syrian rebels, Iraqi tribal leaders and Lebanese politicians.Being mostly right on the Iranian menace is not enough. Rolling back Iran, a worthy and urgent goal, will require a broad international consensus and a less aggressive Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, unattainable foreign ambitions distract, at great cost, from the more important and momentous task of internal reform.', 'Rep.

Just 23 percent think it helps.Setting aside Trump’s words, the poll, released Wednesday finds roughly equal numbers feel the president is being "too tough" on North Korea (22 percent) versus “not tough enough” (19 percent). The largest portion, 46 percent, thinks his handling has been "about right."On the best way to stop North Korea from continuing its nuclear program, more than twice as many voters opt for diplomacy and sanctions (61 percent) over threats of U.S. force (27 percent). Majorities of nearly every demographic group prefer the diplomatic route, although Republicans split on the issue (46-46 percent).An increasing number of voters disapprove of the president’s performance on North Korea. While 39 percent approve, 55 percent disapprove. That’s up from 50 percent disapproval last month, and 45 percent in July.Most Republicans approve (75 percent) of the president’s handling of North Korea, but views among the party faithful divide over the way Trump talks about Pyongyang: 45 percent say it is helpful vs. 46 percent say not helpful."There is uneasiness among Americans about Trump’s ability to keep them safe," says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News poll along with Republican Daron Shaw."His saber rattling looks to be testing the patience of even some core supporters."About 9-in-10 Democrats disapprove (88 percent) of the job Trump’s doing on North Korea and also feel he’s not helping with his talk about the country (92 percent)."Presidents from Eisenhower through Obama have realized that there are no easy options when it comes to North Korea," says Shaw."Americans want to stand strong against that regime, but they clearly think President Trump is pushing the envelope with his rhetoric." Voter sentiment on Iran is similar to views on North Korea.Twice as many say the way Trump talks about Iran hurts rather than helps (59-27 percent).In Trump’s U.N. speech, he also expressed his displeasure with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal -- suggesting the U.S. may pull out. The agreement, which requires recertification in October, eases U.S. sanctions for 10 years in exchange for Iran stopping its nuclear program over that time.The poll shows that 35 percent of voters support the Iran deal, 38 percent oppose it, and 26 percent are unable to offer an opinion. When the agreement was made two years ago, 28 percent supported it, 56 percent were opposed, and 16 percent were unsure (September 2015).On handling Iran, 39 percent approve of the job Trump is doing, while 45 percent disapprove. Fourteen percent think he has been “too tough” on Iran, 25 percent say “not tough enough,” and 44 percent say “about right.”The Fox News poll was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) among 1,017 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide reached on landline and cellphones from September 24-26, 2017.

The American branch represents the United States in the world federation.“Iran wasn’t letting her play in certain tournaments that she needs federation approval to play in, such as world champion cycles or world juniors,” Alejandro Ramirez, her team coach at St. Louis University, which she now attends, said on Tuesday. “Of course, America is not going to have a problem with that.”In July, Ms. Derakhshani moved to the United States to start competing with the university’s chess team, according to a statement from the school.In an interview with WBUR-FM last week, Ms. Derakhshani said she competed without a hijab in the Tradewise Gibraltar Chess Festival, a weeklong competition that ended in February. She also had not worn one in previous tournaments. Iran requires women to wear the head covering in public.Just weeks after the Gibraltar tournament ended, she said she learned from friends that the Iranian chess federation had barred her for not wearing a hijab. The Iranians also barred her 14-year-old brother, Borna, because he had played opposite an Israeli player in Gibraltar, she said.“It was just very out of the blue and without any warning, without anything,” she said in the interview. She did not reply to an emailed message on Tuesday.Ms. Derakhshani was not in Iran when she learned of the ban. She had moved to Barcelona, Spain, in 2015 to play with a chess club and pursue her studies, according to The Associated Press.The semiofficial Mehr news agency of Iran reported on Monday that the president of Iran’s chess federation, Mehrdad Pahlevanzadeh, said it was not unusual for players to change their national federation, and that Ms. Derakhshani was not on Iran’s national team anyway. “She played for Iran only one time in 2014,” he said, The Associated Press reported.At times, political undercurrents between opponents from countries that do not share official relations have surfaced over the chess board.In 2011, one of Iran’s top grandmasters, Ehsan Ghaem Maghami, was expelled from an international tournament after he refused to play a match against an Israeli opponent, the tournament director said, according to a report in The New York Times.He refused again in 2016 at a tournament in Switzerland, the Mehr news agency reported.The predicament Ms. Derakhshani faced was not the first time the hijab set off ripples in the chess world. In 2016, a United States women’s chess champion, Nazi Paikidze-Barnes, said she would boycott the world championship in Iran in 2017 because religious law would require her to wear a hijab.“I am not anti-Islam or any other religion,” Ms. Paikidze-Barnes wrote last year. “I stand for freedom of religion and choice. I’m protesting FIDE’s decision not because of Iran’s religion or people, but for the government’s laws that are restricting my rights as a woman.”Ms. Derakhshani told WBUR-FM that when she learned about the ban, the Women’s World Chess Championship in Iran was taking place, and several women were boycotting the event because of the hijab requirement.“So in the middle of all this, they needed another distraction,” Ms. Derakhshani said. “And somebody tipped off the reporters to specially ask about my brother and I, which worked perfectly. Everybody started talking about us.”Mr. Ramirez, who has known Ms. Derakhshani for about three years, called her a “very outgoing, fun girl” who is not that interested in taking political sides.“She just wants to be known for what she does over the board,” he said.', 'Trump Is Going to Make a Huge Mistake on the Iran Deal - The New York TimesPresident Trump is expected this week to refuse to recertify that Iran is complying with the 2015 nuclear deal, a milestone diplomatic agreement that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.Mr. Trump seems poised to take that action despite the reality that Iran is not violating the terms of the deal. In fact, his key national security cabinet officers have publicly said that Iran is meeting its commitments. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is charged with monitoring and verifying the deal, has issued eight reports over the past two years echoing these conclusions.Instead, the president seems prepared to argue that the deal is no longer in the United States’ vital national security interest because of Iran’s other activities in the Middle East, including its support for terrorism, its meddling in Syria and Yemen, and its threats to Israel’s security.The Trump administration is right that Iranian behavior destabilizes the region, but wrong when it says that such behavior contradicts the “spirit” of the agreement and that he is therefore justified in refusing to certify Iran’s compliance. In fact, Iran’s troubling foreign policy is precisely why the deal was necessary in the first place: An Iran armed with a nuclear weapon would be far more threatening to regional and global security.But rather than take responsibility for deciding the future of the agreement, the president wants to pass the buck. The White House has signaled that after his certification decision, Mr. Trump will urge the Republican-controlled Congress not to reimpose sanctions on Iran that would scuttle the deal. Instead, he hopes Congress will pass new legislation to address concerns that were never part of the nuclear agreement’s original mandate. If Congress complies, such unilateral action to change a multilateral agreement will effectively kill it.The president’s unwillingness to accept the truth about the Iran deal — that it is working to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and that it is clearly in America’s national security interest — will have far-reaching consequences.For one, this decision will breach the trust of America’s partners and isolate our country. The deal was agreed to by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China — along with Germany and the European Union. It was then ratified unanimously by the full Security Council. All of these parties, except the United States, want to keep the accord in place.If President Trump undermines the nuclear deal, the repercussions for American foreign policy will be disastrous: It will drive a wedge between the United States and Europe, weakening the critical trans-Atlantic relationship and increasing the influence of Iran, Russia and China. And when the president travels to China next month seeking support to deal with North Korea’s nuclear program, he will find the Chinese less willing partners. Washington’s credibility will be damaged for the next time we want countries to agree to something, such as condemning Iran’s malicious behavior in the Middle East or tightening the screws on North Korea. Indeed, we are likely to lose any possibility of dialogue with North Korea because Pyongyang will assume the United States will not honor its commitments, even on multilateral agreements. Unpredictability — a favorite self-justification for the president’s erratic actions — has its place as a negotiating tactic, but when it comes to war and peace, reliability and credibility matter most.Whether the Trump administration’s decertification unravels the deal quickly or slowly, unjustified unilateral American action will give the Iranians the moral high ground, allowing them to rightly say that it was the United States, not them, who killed the deal. At the same time, if Iran stays in the agreement with the other countries who are party to it, the United States will lose any standing to bring concerns to the Joint Commission, the forum the agreement set up to oversee progress; any evidence we might offer about suspect Iranian military sites will be viewed with suspicion.If Congress reimposes sanctions, Iran will withdraw from the accord, restart its nuclear program, kick out the inspectors from the I.A.E.A. and refuse to discuss the Americans missing in Iran or held in Iranian prisons. The United States, and the world, would lose our eyes and ears on the ground in Iran — the inspectors. This information vacuum could, in short order, lead us to consider military action to destroy Iranian nuclear facilities, perhaps leading to a wider war in the Middle East. Given the escalatory cycle we are in with North Korea, as well as Pyongyang’s and the president’s rhetoric, America will be faced with two countries whose nuclear ambitions threaten our security.It is hard to see how any of these consequences improve the United States’ national security. Although Mr. Trump ostensibly won’t ask Congress to reimpose sanctions now, the track record for Congress doing what the president wants is dismal. Even if Congress doesn’t move quickly to reimpose sanctions, Iran and our allies in this agreement know that a congressional election is looming, and a tough stance against Tehran could make for appealing campaign ads. The president and the Republican-controlled Congress are not only playing with fire. They are lighting it themselves.A conflagration need not occur. The president and Congress can work with partners around the world, using a wealth of tools, to thwart Iran’s malign actions in the Middle East while keeping the nuclear deal in place to accomplish its objective: stopping Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Given that our national security leaders all know and speak the truth about Iran’s compliance with the deal, we can only hope they and Congress prevent the president from abandoning it and disastrously undermining our national security.', 'Director of defense studies and senior editor for The National Interest explainsFormer Saudi Chief of Intelligence and Ambassador to the U.S. and U.K. Prince Turki al-Faisal is cautioning the Trump team to clarify its stance on defeating “the biggest terrorist in Syria” —the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad —while at the same time praising the clear, ironfisted strategy of the U.S. toward Iran.“Bashar al-Assad is the biggest terrorist. He has killed more people than Hamas, ISIS or al-Nusra,” Faisal said Sunday at the Middle East Policy Forum in New York, coordinated by the Israel Policy Forum, a think tank aimed at supporting and mobilizing the American Jewish community. “Therefore, the effort needs to be to convince Russia not to necessarily abandon, but to keep an arm’s distance from Mr. Assad. If that happens, we can get things happening in Syria.”Russia, a prominent opponent of regime change globally, long has supported the Syrian president and is largely credited for turning around the country’s bloody civil war after it joined the bombing campaign to support pro-Assad forces in September 2015.For his part, Assad consistently has acknowledged the brutal toll of the more than six-year war, which has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands and displaced millions, yet has insisted that their fight has not been against an “opposition,” but against terrorists littered across the country.Former Saudi Chief of Intelligence and Ambassador to the U.S and U.K, Prince Turki al-Faisal (right) spoke with Efraim Halevy, former director of Israel’s Mossad Security Agency, (left) Sunday about Syria and Iran Sunday at the Middle East Policy Forum in New York.            The “cure” to the global terrorism problem, Faisal stated, is to “fix the capitals” in countries across the Middle East and North Africa.“If you look across from Iraq to Syria to Lebanon to Yemen to across the sea to Libya, you see terrorist groups are thriving in these countries,” he said. “The best way to cure this is through viable and workable governments who can deal with these challenges. You have to fix the capitals.”He stressed that terrorist groups are merely “symptoms and political tools” for failing governments.Faisal also pointed out that while the American policy in Syria and toward Assad remains murky, he praised President Donald Trump’s clear and harsh stance toward Iran and recent refusal to certify their compliance to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran nuclear deal.DEFEATING ISIS ISN’T ENOUGH: TRUMP URGENTLY NEEDS A NEW SYRIA POLICY“If you want to put pressure on Iran, you have to do whatever it means to do that and decertification is one way of putting in that pressure to make them live up not just to the letter of the deal, but the spirit,” he said. “The signers of the deal when they signed it portrayed the holy picture that it was going to turn into a very friendly and open and hospitable place to do business with, but that hasn’t happened.”Rather, Faisal observed, the deal has “emboldened” Iran to cement its footprint further in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and the region at-large.“The basic failure of the deal was to deal with (these) Iranian extraterritorial ambitions,” he said.RUSSIA’S LAVROV WARNS ONE-SIDED CHANGES COULD SINK IRAN DEALFaisal was joined by Efraim Halevy, former director of Israel’s Mossad Security Agency, who instead reiterated the importance of ensuring the deal remains in place and countered that from an Israel point of view, they at least have time now —10 to 13 years —to deal with issues that were not included, such as terrorism and missile capabilities.“Israel is indestructible. We are able to, if necessary, protect ourselves and emerge intact. I have huge faith in our military establishment, our defense establishment, and our intelligence establishment. We are less indestructible than we ever were,” he said. “Having said that, the Iran deal was not an ideal deal. But this was because Israel did not wish the negotiations to include all the items on the agenda.”Rather, Halevy advocated that they wanted the United States to “focus on the nuclear issue and nothing else.”“We didn’t want to delay the deal, we wanted it to come as quickly as possible and be as effective as possible,” he added. “Things are happening in Iran today, changes are happening in Iran today.”The forum marked the first time Faisal had visited a synagogue in America, and he emphasized he hoped “it would not be the last.”Hollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

Lavrov, came during a news conference he held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.“U.S.-Russia relations are suffering not from the fact that there are conflicts but rather because the previous U.S. administration was small-hearted and they were revengeful,” Mr. Lavrov said. “They put this time bomb in U.S.-Russia relations. I didn’t expect that from a Nobel Peace Prize winner.”Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for former President Barack Obama, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.Mr. Lavrov was referring to the steep slide in relations between Washington and the Kremlin over a variety of issues, including the imposition of sanctions on Russia in connection with Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine.He said he had never bargained with his Western counterparts about the lifting of sanctions. He also dismissed allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 American presidential election to tilt the outcome in favor of Donald J. Trump instead of Hillary Clinton.Even after a year of inquiries, Mr. Lavrov said, “we did not see a single fact.”Mr. Lavrov said he had asked his American counterpart, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, for evidence of Russian meddling in the election and was told it was confidential.Mr. Lavrov dismissed that contention as well.“You know I cannot believe that,” he said. “Information is leaking all the time.”Especially in an investigation that involves so many people, he went on, “it cannot be so that not a single fact is leaked. It would have been leaked.”There are still large gaps between the Russian and American positions on a number of matters, from the question of what to do about Iran to how to handle the North Korean nuclear crisis.On Iran, Mr. Lavrov said he agreed with European diplomats who this week rejected American demands to reopen the 2015 nuclear agreement. The deal has been endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Lavrov said, and if there are other concerns about Iran, such as its ballistic missiles program or its role in Syria, they should be addressed separately.“Bringing together apples and oranges would be wrong, especially in such a complicated issue as the Iran nuke deal,” Mr. Lavrov said.On North Korea, he said it was time to “calm down the hotheads” and consider offers of mediation, including one by Secretary General António Guterres of the United Nations. Mr. Lavrov advocated what he called a “reasonable” approach to resolving the standoff, “instead of kindergarten fights between children.”', 'Obsession With Iran Is Driving the Mideast and the U.S. Crazy - The New York TimesIf there is a common denominator explaining so many recent events in the Middle East — actions by Saudi Arabia, the U.S., Syria, Israel and Yemen — it can be expressed in one word: Iran. Everyone has Iran’s growing power and influence in the region on the mind — including Iran — and that obsession is making a lot of people crazy.For instance, the Trump administration, like Barack Obama’s, actually wants to get away from the Middle East — as much as possible — but while leaving as little Iranian influence behind as possible.Saudi Arabia, under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as M.B.S., wants to get ahead in the Middle East and reform his economy for the 21st century — while curtailing as much Iranian influence in the region as possible.And the Iranians want to get wide — to expand their influence from Tehran to the Mediterranean — not by creating a successful and attractive development model at home that Arabs and other Muslims would want to emulate, but rather by forcing their way into Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq through local Shiite militias that have created states within these states.This is generating a lot of anxiety in the Arab world, the U.S. and Israel without enough people stepping back and thinking: So pro-Iranian militias control a bunch of bad neighborhoods in Beirut, Sana, Damascus and Baghdad. Tell me, what is second prize? What are they really “winning”?Iran has a richly talented population, and rich Persian culture. But instead of unleashing both and enabling Iran’s youth to realize their full potential — and making the country influential that way — the ayatollahs are suppressing those talents at home and unleashing the power of Shiite mercenaries on Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, and compelling influence that way instead.It’s actually rather pathetic. The greatest thing that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia could do is to stop working each other into a lather over this Iranian “threat” and to focus on their domestic reform agendas. That would be the best revenge on Tehran.For starters, American, European and Arab leaders should all be encouraging M.B.S. to keep going where no Saudi leader before him has dared to go — pursuing his stated goal of reversing the religious right turn that the kingdom took in 1979, after the takeover of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Muslim extremists. That prompted the Saudi rulers at the time to ban fun, tighten the control of the religious police over society and to much more aggressively export the most misogynist, anti-pluralistic interpretation of Islam to mosques and madrasas across the Muslim world, tilting the whole faith community to the right.If M.B.S. fulfills his vow to bring Saudi Islam back to “moderation,” it will surely improve the status of Muslim women, the quality of education in Muslim communities and the relationship between Muslims and other faiths across the globe. We in the West have spent tremendous sums “countering Muslim extremism.” We may finally have a Saudi leader ready to do that work — from the wellspring of Islam — and it would over time hugely benefit Muslims and non-Muslims alike.But for M.B.S. to advance that agenda requires a strong, economically healthy Saudi Arabia. Alas, for now Saudi Arabia is far from that; its trajectory in recent years has been sharply downward. Most Saudis today are focused on jobs and education, not on Iran, and if M.B.S. can fix those needs with his reform plan it will only propel his push to moderate Saudi Islam.Precisely because these intertwined religious and economic reform agendas are so critical, wise friends of M.B.S. would also be offering him some tough love — by telling him that it’s great to arrest thieving Saudi billionaires and throw them in the Ritz-Carlton, but it has to be done with transparency and within a rule of law — which would enhance his legitimacy — not in an arbitrary way that will hurt his legitimacy and frighten future investors. They also have to stress to him that to be an effective anti-corruption campaigner, he has to be open to criticism himself and live modestly. No more giant yachts.On foreign policy, M.B.S.’s real friends would also tell him that while Iran has expanded its influence across the Arab world, the Saudis do not have the muscles to take it head-on right now. The Iranians have spent nearly 40 years developing their influence through underground networks and Shiite proxies.Meanwhile, the Saudis wrote checks to Sunni militias, who never stayed bought. Or they bought big weapons systems that are useless in this age of irregular warfare — and only lead to the kind of Saudi aerial bombardments of Yemen that have led to so many civilian deaths, disease and starvation — and a costly stalemate for Riyadh. Saudi Arabia needs to end that war — now — and get out of Yemen, even if it means leaving some Iranian influence behind.I was just speaking to a Kuwaiti banker who told me that M.B.S.’s popularity among Kuwaiti women and youth on Kuwaiti social media is unlike anything he has ever seen. Kuwaiti youth are asking why isn’t anyone throwing their corrupt princes into a Ritz-Carlton or just a tent in the desert? Why doesn’t their aging and unimaginative ruling family have someone shaking things up like M.B.S.?But they don’t like M.B.S.’s foreign policy — Yemen most of all, but also the ham-fisted interventions in Lebanon and Qatar. They look bullying. M.B.S. would unlock so much more good will and influence for himself if he curtailed these ill-conceived, Iranian-obsessed foreign adventures.My view on Saudi Arabia today is very simple: Because it has so much deferred reform to undertake — before its oil money runs out — the biggest question is not if M.B.S. is too brash, too brutal, too power-hungry or too imperfect. It’s whether he’s too late — that Saudi Arabia is now un-reformable. I think not, but that is why, with all of M.B.S.’s flaws, we need to help increase his chances for success. If he can turn Jiddah into another Dubai, where so many Iranians now love to vacation and bank, he will do more to increase his influence in the region and diminish Iran’s than anything else he could do.But just about the last thing Saudi Arabia or any of our Arab allies need right now is for President Trump to do what the White House says he will do Wednesday — announce plans to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. I can’t think of anything more unnecessary and destabilizing. It is such a gift, wrapped with a bow, to Iran and Hezbollah. You can bet they will use it to present the Saudis, Jordanians, U.A.E., Palestinian Authority and Egypt as enablers of an American “Zionist agenda.”At a time when Iran is extending its influence, and our Arab allies are preoccupied with domestic reforms — which require a lot of pain for their publics that strains the legitimacy of their leaders — this is the last thing they need from their American friend. It is such a pathetic way for Trump to deflect attention from his utter failure to make any progress on the Israeli-Palestinian front.And it is such a pathetic way to disguise the fact that America really is not present in the Middle East these days. Our ability to shape events there is less than anytime since World War II.“For the first time since 1945 America is no longer a leader,” argued Ivo Daalder, the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a co-author of a forthcoming book, “The Empty Throne: How America Abdicated Its Global Leadership Role.” Though we are less powerful “we could still be influential,” he added. “But that influence has to come by building strong coalitions.”Alas, Trump has neither the patience for such coalition-building nor the willingness to make the compromises with allies — let alone with distasteful rivals like Russia or Iran — that will be required to stabilize the Middle East when we have neither power nor desire to do it alone.So Trump will rail against Iran and pretend that he is Thor, throwing down thunderbolts, like recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. But he’s really just a lost tourist, looking for his bus. Which is really unfortunate at a time when Saudi Arabia needs a wise U.S. ally more than ever, Iran needs to be confronted with smart diplomacy more than ever and Israel’s security requires some kind of creative diplomacy in Syria more than ever.', 'After ISIS, What Comes Next? - The New York TimesThe liberation of Raqqa, Syria, the Islamic State’s final stronghold, has severely weakened the group as a military threat. But as its members slink off the battlefield to melt into local populations or infiltrate nations in Europe, Africa and around the world, they leave a region in ruins and an almost impossible challenge for the United States.Over four gruesome years, ISIS swallowed up large areas of Iraq and Syria, taking control of oil fields and using beheadings, rapes and other cruelties to terrorize populations. Now, the degradation of the group has allowed Iran, Russia and others to scramble for advantage. The anti-ISIS coalition is fracturing, reviving divisions and creating conditions that could allow the extremists to regroup. And American leaders seem to have no clear plan to manage this instability or to capitalize on their military success.One big concern is the semiautonomous region of Kurdistan, which until recently was Iraq’s anchor. Today its future, and that of a unified Iraq, is in doubt. That’s because of an independence referendum in September that was pushed through by Masoud Barzani, then the Kurdish leader, despite warnings from Iraq’s central government, Turkey, Iran and the United States — the Kurds’ main ally — that the vote could lead to Iraq’s dissolution, undermine the anti-ISIS fight and widen divisions even among Kurdish factions.Since the referendum, which won overwhelming support from voters, Iraqi forces took control of Kirkuk, an oil-rich Iraqi city that Mr. Barzani — taking advantage of the threat of ISIS at the time — had Kurdish military forces seize in 2014. Iraq is also reportedly moving to take control of Kurdistan’s border crossings with Syria and Turkey from Kurdish forces armed and trained by Washington. Mr. Barzani has been forced from power.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Baghdad last month to urge the Kurds — who have been among the most capable foes of ISIS — and the central government to settle their differences. After that, the Kurds announced plans to suspend the independence drive and enter talks. Calming Iraq-Kurds tensions and resolving longstanding grievances, like finding a fair formula for sharing oil profits, while maintaining Kurdistan’s standing as a semiautonomous region should be an American priority. All these steps are necessary for regional stability.Meanwhile, Iran and Russia have expanded their regional influence. Both Iran and Iraq have Shiite majorities, and after the Americans overthrew Saddam Hussein, under whom the Sunni minority held sway in Iraq, Iran cultivated close ties with its neighbor. Iran now exercises leverage there in part by training and arming militias allied with the government in battling ISIS. In Syria, Iran has also provided troops and arms that, along with Russian jet fighters, have kept President Bashar al-Assad in power and helped advance Tehran’s goal of establishing a corridor linking Iran’s Hezbollah allies in Lebanon with Damascus. In fact, Syrian forces are in a race against the United States and its allies to take control of remaining ISIS pockets to strengthen their hand in negotiations over a future Syrian political settlement.When the fighting is done, there is no practical way short of war to force Russia and Iran to leave Syria entirely. But the United States should explore ways to negotiate limits on the two countries’ roles in postwar Syria.Another major challenge is an old one: persuading Iraq’s Shiite-led government to integrate the Sunni minority into the governing structure so that Sunnis have a stake in the country’s future. Chronic mistreatment of the Sunnis afforded ISIS, a Sunni group, a fertile ground for recruits.Given Mr. Trump’s America First vision, it is unclear how he will respond to such complex challenges. His distaste for nation building, with its implication of a long-term commitment, is understandable. The United States has tried nation building in Iraq, Afghanistan and other places with little success and should not assume the main burden now. But leaving Iraq and Syria without a recovery plan — one that encompasses reconstruction, security and improved governance — will create conditions for ISIS’s return.Those conditions will be worse if a political solution to Syria’s civil war doesn’t ensure Mr. Assad’s eventual departure. That is an outcome Russia and America tried to orchestrate before and should try again. Russia and Iran, pro-Assad allies who inflicted much of the destruction on Syria, must assume a major responsibility for the rebuilding. Other partners, like the European Union, are also needed.Having decimated ISIS, the United States and its partners in the anti-ISIS campaign must turn to finding and constraining the militants who have dispersed from their failed caliphate and persuading the Mideast’s overwhelmingly youthful population that the future lies not with extremists but with people who free them to dream and achieve.', '', 'Saudis Intercept Missile Fired From Yemen That Came Close to Riyadh - The New York TimesSANA, Yemen — A ballistic missile fired from Yemen came close to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Saturday and was intercepted by the Saudi military over the city’s international airport, the Saudi defense ministry said.Coming on a day of increasing regional tensions, it was the first time such an attack had come so close to the center of Riyadh in the two years since Saudi Arabia started a war against the Houthi rebel group that toppled Yemen’s government.Yemen’s Houthi-controlled defense ministry said its forces had targeted the airport with a long-range missile called the Burqan 2H in response to an attack by the Saudi-led coalition on Wednesday that killed 26 people in a hotel and a nearby market.But the Saudi-led coalition suggested the attack had been ordered by Iran, which it said backs the Houthis.“This act of aggression against Riyadh proves involvement of one of the terror states supporting the Houthis,” the coalition was quoted as saying in a tweet from Al Hadath, a Saudi-run news channel.Several hours after the missile attack, the Yemeni capital, Sana, was hit by the worst barrage of Saudi-led coalition airstrikes in more than a year.About 12 strikes were heard hitting the defense ministry downtown and other targets mostly on the city outskirts. The exchange of fire took place on a day when the region was on edge over the growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran.Earlier, the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, resigned from a unity government that includes Iran’s Lebanese ally Hezbollah. Speaking from Riyadh, he blamed Iran for interfering in Arab affairs. Iran and Hezbollah read the move as pressure from Saudi Arabia, Mr. Hariri’s patron, to isolate them as part of a campaign to curb Iranian influence.The Yemeni defense ministry has claimed several times to have fired a Burqan 2 missile at Saudi Arabia, which has acknowledged at least one previous strike.Residents and travelers in Riyadh reported a loud explosion on Saturday. The Twitter account of King Khalid International Airport issued a message saying airport operations had not been affected.Videos from the scene showed people rushing to airport windows, smoke and what appeared to be flashes or fires on the ground.One showed red flares rising toward the sky.Some pro-Saudi commenters in Yemen and Saudi media suggested that the Houthis could have fired the missiles on behalf of Iran or Hezbollah.Military analysts at IHS Jane’s have written that the Houthis’ emerging use of ballistic missiles offers some support for American, Saudi and Israeli allegations that Iran is aiding them with parts or technology, but add that it would be difficult for Iran to ship whole missiles to Yemen. Another possibility, the analysts say, is that the missiles were acquired by Yemen from North Korea before the current conflict.In Sana, jets were heard overhead and residents reported airstrikes. Ali Hassan, a taxi driver, said that roads leading to the defense ministry downtown were closed by the police.“I saw smoke rising from the ministry,” he said, adding that he also saw an airstrike in another area where a weapon depot was located.The ministry is in a densely populated area, a World Heritage site known as Bab al-Yemen, which has been targeted before. Saudi-led coalition jets could be heard over Sana. The bulk of airstrikes in retaliation reportedly targeted the outskirts of Sana.The Houthis’ news channel, Al-Masirah, said on Twitter: “We repeatedly affirmed that capitals of aggression states won’t be spared from our ballistic missiles in retaliation for the constant targeting of innocent civilians.”', 'Long Divided, Iran Unites Against Trump and Saudis in a Nationalist Fervor - The New York TimesTEHRAN — The busiest square in Tehran is dominated by an enormous billboard with a drawing of a young man in the uniform of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, extending his hand to invite Iranians to follow his path. Underneath the image, teenagers line up, flashing victory signs, as they take selfies with the placard in the background.In life, the man on the billboard, 26-year-old Mohsen Hojaji, was just as anonymous as the thousands of other Iranians who have rotated in and out of war zones in Iraq and Syria in recent years. But after having been taken prisoner, videotaped and later beheaded by the Islamic State in August, Mr. Hojaji has been transformed by Iran’s government into a war hero, the face of a new surge in Iranian nationalism.After years of cynicism, sneering or simply tuning out all things political, Iran’s urban middle classes have been swept up in a wave of nationalist fervor.The changing attitude, while some years in the making, can be attributed to two related factors: the election of President Trump and the growing competition with Saudi Arabia, Iran’s sectarian rival, for regional dominance. Iranians listened during the 2016 campaign as Mr. Trump denounced the Iran nuclear treaty as “the worst deal ever negotiated” and promised to tear it up. They watched in horror when, as president, he sold more than $100 billion worth of weapons to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and participated in a traditional war dance in Riyadh. And they are alarmed at the foreign policy moves of the young Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, whom they see as hotheaded and inexperienced.At the same time, they now believe they have something to be proud of, with Iranian-led militias playing a central role in defeating the Islamic State militant group in Syria and Iraq, increasing Iran’s regional influence in the process.The two most popular stars in Iran today — a country with thriving film, theater and music industries — are not actors or singers but two establishment figures: Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the leader of Iran’s regional military effort, which is widely seen as a smashing success; and the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, the symbol of a reasonable and measured Iran.In short, it appears that Mr. Trump and the Saudis have helped the government achieve what years of repression could never accomplish: widespread public support for the hard-line view that the United States and Riyadh cannot be trusted and that Iran is now a strong and capable state capable of staring down its enemies.On the day of a state-orchestrated commemoration ceremony for Mr. Hojaji, Morteza Hosseinzadeh, a 33-year-old graduate of theater studies at Tehran University who considers himself a reformist, came out early to pay his respects. Dressed in black and holding a poster bearing the portrait of the new martyr, he looked every bit like the hard-line supporters of the clerical government.“There are many here like me, who don’t care for the Islamic Republic and its rules,” he said. “But today is about something bigger than that, one of us has been killed. At the same time this American president is breaking our hearts with his rhetoric and threats. We have to choose sides. I choose for my country.”Iran’s hard-liners are savoring the reversal in their fortunes, after losing influence in the Obama years. “Thanks to Trump’s dishonest, cheating and crazy remarks, he has proved what we have said for a long time: America cannot be trusted,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line political analyst. “Many didn’t believe us, but now they do.”The seeds of the new nationalism were planted with the election of the moderate Hassan Rouhani as president in 2013. It was the first glimmer of hope for Iran’s urban middle classes since the brutal crackdown on street protests following the 2009 presidential election, widely seen as rigged.President Rouhani promised a nuclear deal, to escape the suffocating international sanctions over Iran’s nuclear program that had depressed and distorted the economy and isolated the country. When the treaty was signed in 2015, Iranians rejoiced over the chance, finally, to become a “normal” country.Then came the Trump administration, and its singular focus on Iran as the source, as the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has said on numerous occasions, of all the troubles in the Middle East.Iran’s leaders have begun promoting patriotic causes, recognizing in the changing mood a chance to reinforce their credibility, which had been flagging.Recently, missiles were put on display in city centers so that families and children could pose for photos in front of them. State-run television has been promoting an annual pilgrimage where millions participate in a walk into neighboring Iraq, as a symbol of national and religious strength. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who rarely comments on music, cited “Iran, if They Break Your Heart,” a homage to Iran, as one of his favorite songs.Many Iranians now cheer when a missile is tested, said Hamidreza Jalaeipour, a professor of sociology and a leading reformist, “even those who are completely secular.” The tests, he added, “are making them feel strong and safe.”The pressure from the United States and the growing threats from Saudi Arabia are creating an us-against-them atmosphere, Mr. Jalaeipour said.The new solidarity in the face of outside threats is not new in Iran, nor is it insulating the government from all criticism. After the earthquake earlier this month in western Iran, for instance, many people blasted state officials on social media for failing to provide timely help.Yet, in a demonstration of the newfound spirit, Iranians from across the country pitched in to gather water, food and tents and transported the aid with their own cars to the disaster zone.“There is just a big feeling of unity,” said Pouria Gorji, an office manager who personally delivered four trucks of supplies to the quake area. “We come together when we are hurt.”The state’s theocratic ideology has long dictated an artificial version of nationalism, where everything is related to Islam. Love for Iran’s long pre-Islamic history has been illegal in some instances, and often deliberately ignored by officials and state television.But in light of the new national unity, those restraints have been relaxed so long as the presentations encourage patriotism.In October, for example, the government allowed one of the former palaces of the despised, pro-Western shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to be used for a multimedia performance where actors re-enacted parts of the ‘‘Shahnameh,’’ or book of Kings, which describes Iran’s long pre-Islamic history. The epic poem depicts a time — much like now — when Iran was surrounded by rivals and isolated.One evening around 4,000 middle-class Iranians, with men wearing suits and women carrying designer handbags, gathered at the palace in North Tehran. Images of Persepolis, the ancient palace of Darius the Great, were projected on the building, as famous actors played legendary figures from Iran’s long history.As an encore, a traditional singer, Homayoun Shajarian, performed ‘‘My Iran,’’ a love song to the country. People stood out of respect, many with tears streaming down their faces. The venue was sold out for 30 days straight.“I felt so proud. There was an overwhelming sense of unity,” said Soghol Sheikhan, an accountant, who was at the concert. “I got goose bumps.”Borders and geography are other rallying points for nationalists. When Mr. Trump in October gave a speech outlining his Iran strategy, he called it a “dictatorship” led by “murderous” leaders who “spread death, destruction and chaos all over the globe.” But what really riled up Iranians was when he called the Persian Gulf the “Arabian Gulf.”Within minutes, Iranian news media, state-run and otherwise, began denouncing his use of the name.Two hours later, Mr. Rouhani, in a live rebuttal of Mr. Trump’s speech, wasted no time with the litany of accusations by Mr. Trump and cut straight to the point.“How is it that a president has not learned the name of the international historical gulf?” the Iranian president said. “The same Persian Gulf unfortunately frequented by the American navy, unduly and constantly. Trump should ask his military who have the maps what is written as the name of this gulf.” (In fact, United States Navy maps say ‘‘Persian Gulf.’’)Iranians attacked Mr. Trump’s Instagram account, leaving nearly three million comments about the Persian Gulf, or profanities. An Iranian journalist based in the United States, Bahman Kalbasi, wrote in a tweet that he “couldn’t think of a faster way to unite the public in Iran behind the government: go after the nuclear deal (vital to the economy) and don’t use Persian Gulf.”There are limits to the new nationalism. Iranians who tried in October to commemorate the ancient King Cyrus with a gathering at his tomb found roads blocked and a high fence around the site. Well-known nationalists were sent text messages warning them not to participate.Arvand Dashtaray, a liberal-minded theater director, who has frequently injected veiled criticism of Iranian society and its leaders into his plays, now says that he and like-minded reformists and moderates were wrong to bet on the United States.Mr. Dashtaray still dreams of bringing the experimental American playwright Robert Wilson to perform in Iran. But as for Mr. Trump, “he is the true face of the U.S., an unfair, weapons-exporting nation that doesn’t care about anybody and especially not about us.”He added: “We need to understand that the U.S. has been playing with us all along. Trump is proving that our hard-liners were right all these years, to say that America cannot be trusted.”Iran’s leaders, on the other hand, long regarded by Mr. Dashtaray as irresponsible in foreign policy, have now “become the logical party,” he said. “Of course, I love them more.”', '', 'Kurdistan’s Dangerous Vote on Independence - The New York TimesThe referendum on independence that Iraqi Kurds held on Monday was unwise, dangerous and very understandable.Unwise, because it raised high and probably unachievable hopes among Kurds not only in Iraq, but also in Iran, Turkey and Syria, the countries where they live.Dangerous because those yearnings trigger multiple alarms in one of the least stable regions on earth.And understandable because few people have dreamed of independence for so long, at such cost and with so little success.Even before full results were in, there was little doubt the Kurds had voted overwhelmingly for a separate state. It is hard not to sympathize with that longing, especially given the brutal suppression of Iraqi Kurds under Saddam Hussein. Since the 1991 gulf war, the five million Iraqi Kurds have created a semiautonomous Kurdistan region whose rich oil and gas resources have supported a relatively peaceful existence. Kurdish military forces, the pesh merga, have played a major role in the fight against the Islamic State.Massoud Barzani, the president of Kurdistan, as the Kurdish region in Iraq is known, has said the vote will not lead to an immediate, unilateral declaration of independence, but to the opening of negotiations with Baghdad and consultations with neighboring states and other powers.Yet Iraq, Iran, Syria, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the Arab League and the United States, as well as the European Union and the United Nations, all tried to pre-empt the vote. Iraq has no intention of losing rich oil fields. The White House declared the referendum “provocative and destabilizing,” and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis traveled to Kurdistan last month to argue that the referendum would be a distraction from the fight against ISIS. Turkey, Iran and Syria fear that their restive Kurdish minorities will join in secessionist demands. Only Israel, with a history of close ties to Kurds and hopes for an ally against Iran, has declared support for a Kurdish state.In any case, the vote was held. There is a new and volatile reality that cannot be denied. All sides — the Kurds, their neighbors, Washington and all the others involved — must avoid any action that could prompt violence. Then, urgent efforts must begin to channel newly fired passions into what room remains for diplomatic maneuvers. The United States, whose forces have long protected Iraqi Kurds and fought alongside the pesh merga, should be at the forefront of that search.', 'Under Mr. Trump, America Surrenders - The New York TimesAmericans have long struggled with the question of whether this country should be more involved in world affairs, or less. The contest of ideas between internationalists and isolationists has been particularly fierce among Republicans, going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft and continuing on to the beginning of World War II.But since the end of that war, whatever the differences in their priorities and points of emphasis, every president has chosen engagement rather than retreat, sometimes with surprising and positive outcomes. Richard Nixon forged relations with communist China; Ronald Reagan, having consigned the Soviet Union to “the ash heap of history,” went on to negotiate arms control treaties with Mikhail Gorbachev. Even those like Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama who argued in various ways for scaling back America’s commitments overseas insisted on a leadership role, if not the leadership role, in building an international system grounded in democratic and free-market principles.There have been plenty of mistakes and unforeseen developments that have tested the United States and raised questions about the wisdom of its policies. But, on the whole, the world has benefited greatly from America’s guidance and its willingness to engage with allies at every step of the way. NATO, the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are all part of the architecture of global security and development that American presidents helped create.President Trump is now taking a sledgehammer to that system. His argument, if that term can apply to such an inchoate position, is that America for too long has been “losing,” a situation he has set out to correct with nonnegotiable demands and gratuitous confrontations. He promises both to achieve more and to retrench. He promises to put “America first” while at the same time condemning it to a secondary role in global deliberations. It is a bizarre and contradictory policy: In seeking to liberate the United States from international obligations, and in waging war on multilateral institutions, he is not only destroying America’s reputation as a trusted ally but also ceding the future to the very same aggressive powers, especially the authoritarian regimes of China and Russia, that he purports to protect Americans from. Meanwhile, his running feuds with the free press, the courts and Congress are diminishing America’s standing as a bastion of constitutional liberties.The latest assaults occurred last week, when, in the space of a few days, Mr. Trump walked away from or threatened to walk away from an important agreement on Iran, a relationship with Unesco and the North American Free Trade Agreement, painstakingly negotiated in the first Bush and the Clinton administrations.For more than a year Mr. Trump denigrated the Iran deal, under which Iran would substantially halt its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. On Friday he formally disavowed it by refusing to certify that Iran is in compliance. While he stopped short of explicitly killing the accord or rewriting it, the president did it great harm and kicked its fate to Congress, where its future is uncertain.He did so despite the advice of his top people — the secretaries of defense and state and his military and intelligence chiefs — who say the agreement is in America’s interest; and despite the assurance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran 24/7 under a robust verification regime, that Tehran is abiding by its terms.The countries that negotiated the deal with Mr. Obama — Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia — also begged the White House to stick with it. But Mr. Trump demonstrated once again that he can’t abide his predecessor’s accomplishments, that he will not be persuaded by facts and that he places little or no value on the idea that honoring national commitments safeguards confidence in America’s word. Why would North Korea negotiate with the United States over its nuclear stockpile when it sees how little store the Trump administration sets by diplomatic accords?America’s European allies, outraged by Mr. Trump’s decision, have since reaffirmed their commitment to the deal, which includes encouraging European companies to invest in Iran. (Emmanuel Macron is reportedly considering a visit to Tehran, which would be a first for a French president since the 1970s.)Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, because of its anti-Israel bias, is not likely to be nearly as consequential as his opposition to the Iran deal, although it extends his war on international obligations. And his threat to tear up Nafta is still just a threat, albeit an ominous one.Most economists agree that Nafta contributed to some job losses in manufacturing but that abandoning it would hurt the economy over all. Even American industries that brought some production back within the borders would probably use fewer workers than in the past, because of automation. Further, other sectors of the economy, like agriculture and services, would stand to lose business if Canada and Mexico imposed higher tariffs on American imports. Whatever gains the United States might enjoy by torpedoing Nafta are unlikely to be enough to justify alienating two of its most important allies and neighbors.If revoked or substantially renegotiated, Nafta would join an already sizable list of agreements on which Mr. Trump has reneged, including the Paris accord on climate change and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, another trade agreement. He has meanwhile raised doubts in various speeches and offhand remarks about his commitment to the United Nations and to NATO. And to what end? The stock answer is that he is seeking to placate and energize his “base” — the voters troubled by economic decline — by building a wall not just against immigrants but against economic competition and foreign entanglements, thereby making their lives and livelihoods more secure. In an economically interdependent world, that is a false promise. It also undermines critically important global relationships, erodes American credibility and cedes influence and the investment opportunities that go with it to ambitious nations like China that are only too happy to fill the role.America First, Mr. Trump says. America last is more like it.', "The U.S. military must figure out how to keep Iraq from breaking apart while also preventing neighboring Iran from turning Iraq into a proxy state; Jennifer Griffin reports on 'Special Report.'It makes no sense for a nation to treat its enemies kindly and its allies harshly. Any nation that tries this foolish approach will see its enemies grow stronger and more dangerous, and will lose its allies when it abandons them.Yet for eight years, the Obama administration followed this upside-down policy, and received contempt and bad behavior in return from nations around the world. And now, unfortunately, the Trump administration is following this policy with Iran, by “not taking sides” to prevent the Iraqi government from using military force against our Kurdish allies.Following a Sept. 25 vote by the Kurds in Kirkuk calling for independence from Iraq, Iraqi troops and Iranian-backed militias moved north into the Kurdish province to take control from the Kurdistan Regional Government. Iraqi troops and Shia militias seized the last district in Kirkuk on Friday from Kurdish fighters, known as the Peshmerga, after a three-hour battle.The Kurds had controlled Kirkuk since 2014, when Iraqi troops fled the forces of the Islamic State terrorist group, also known as ISIS. While remaining part of Iraq, the Kurdish province operated with a high degree autonomy.The Iraqi Kurdish independencereferendum sparked fears that Kurds in neighboring areas of Iran, Turkey and Syria would want to seek independence as well and unite to form a new nation –an idea opposed by all the thosecountries and Iraq.The Iraqi Kurds have been loyal U.S. allies in our fight against Al Qaeda and ISIS, and have fought bravely and effectively. American troops have fought and died with our Kurdish allies defending Iraq and we have spent blood and treasure trying to build reliable partners in Iraq’s Security Forces.But the Iraqi forces are also supported by Iran, including that nation’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. Treasury Department earlier this month.And Iran is clearly an enemy of the United States, Israel and many of our Arab allies. It is a state sponsor of terrorism and an oppressor of its own people, with particularly harsh restrictions on women, homosexuals and Christians. President Trump has sharply criticized the nation’s conduct and has threatened to withdraw from the agreement designed to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons.It’s in America’s interest to have good and peaceful relations with and between the Kurds and the Iraqis, despite Iran’s support of Iraq. But we shouldn’t abandon our Kurdish allies to achieve this goal.The man most responsible for the failure of the U.S. to give adequate support to the Kurds is Brett McGurk, President Trump’s special envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS. He held the same position in the Obama administration and has been allowed to keep his job.President Obama replaced one of our most respected military leaders – Marine Corps Gen. John Allen – with lawyer McGurk. While serving as envoy to Iraq, McGurk has presided over the Iranian takeover of what’s left of Iraq.Shamefully, the State and Defense Departments followed McGurk’s strategy and gave tacit approval for the Iraqi government and its Iranian allies to move against our dedicated Kurdish friends.McGurk told U.S. officials and Iraq, Turkey and Iran that he could convince the Kurds not to hold their independence referendum. He told U.S. and Kurdish officials that he could stop Baghdad from using military force against the Kurds. He failed on both accounts.As President Trump has noted, Iran received $1.7 billion from the Obama administration for signing the nuclear agreement with the U.S. and other nations“Just imagine the sight of those huge piles of money being hauled off by the Iranians waiting at the airport for the cash,” President Trump said. McGurk was one of the U.S. officials who handed over that money to the Iranians.One of the leaders of Iranian forces backing Iraq against its Kurdish citizens is Qassem Soleimani, who commands the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force. He is a terrorist who has been killing Americans for years in Iraq and is still doing it through the Taliban in Afghanistan. Half a world away from the NFL, Soleimani also disrespects our flag, having his forces walk on it in parades.Last month, the Kurds believed that being a proven ally of the United States against former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, Al Qaeda and ISIS would result in America recognizing their referendum for independence from the Iraqi state.But the hard-line that McGurk took against our Kurdish allies – warning them harshly against their peaceful independence referendum – had the effect of convincing the Iranian-backed militias and the political leadership in Baghdad that they had a green light to enter Kirkuk. In the words of former Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker, this criticism “may have emboldened Baghdad to take a harsher posture than it otherwise would.”For the last decade, I’ve briefed Army Generals H.R. McMaster (now President Trump’s national security adviser), David Petreaus (who became CIA director) and Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno on the strong influence of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards on Iraq’s security forces.But for years, McGurk has been downplaying this influence.On Oct. 1, a highly lethal roadside bomb called anexplosively formed penetrator(EFP) reappeared in Iraq after six years. It killed Army Spec. Alexander Missildine and wounded another U.S. soldier. Its reappearance was a warning from Iran: the Islamic Republic is prepared to begin killing Americans again. The EFP is the signature weapon of two Revolutionary Guard-led militias in Iraq.Scandalously, these militias receive paychecks and equipment from both the U.S.-backed Iraqi Ministry of Interior and the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force. It’s Brett McGurk’s responsibility to provide that information to the president and Congress, because it’s a violation of the Leahy Law. That law was enacted to keep U.S. funds and equipment from security forces involved in human rights violations. Qassem Soleimani is smiling.If President Trump wants to push back against Iran he should do so in the Kurdish areas of Iraq. This is where he can stop Iran from creating its highly coveted land bridge through Iraq and from eventually controlling northern Iraq as well. Stopping Iran here would save lives, save alliances and give credibility to America’s commitment to our allies. We can do that by working with our only authentic allies in the region, the Kurds.Our Kurdish allies need strong American support and our Iranian enemies need to know we are serious about them and serious about supporting our friends.Michael Pregent was an embedded adviser to the Peshmerga in Mosul and an intelligence and policy adviser to Generals Petraeus and Odierno on Iranian activities in Iraq.

(REUTERS/Mohamed al-Sayaghi, File)                                                                    A new report released by an Iranian opposition group claims that Iran’s biggest airline —Mahan Air —is run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its Qods Force. This force is commanded by notorious Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.The new report published by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) states that the so-called private airline, Iran’s largest commercial airliner, is anything but commercial, and in fact works as a toolfor Iran’s expansionist policies. President Donald Trump sanctioned the IRGC last month for supporting terrorism.The report titled, “An IRGC Qods Force entity operating under the guise of a private company,”stated thatone of the most significant findings “was that Mahan Air Corporation does not merely cooperate with the IRGC and the Qods Force, but is wholly owned and controlled by them.” This is the sameQods Force which was sanctioned by the U.S. for providing material support to the Taliban and other terrorist organizations in 2007.The report describes the critical role that Mahan Air plays, along with other Iranian carriers, in “Iran’s interference in the countries of the region, including the transfer of personnel and logistics for the IRGC and proxy militias.”According to the report, as of 2017,Mahan Airincludes62 airliners and flies commercially to 41 destinations in 24 countries on three continents. Major destinationsinclude Paris, Milan and Munich in Europe, and others in Asia and Africa, where front companies have been created to bypass sanctions.The report alsodescribes the complex relationship between Soleimani, the Qods Force commander, and some senior commanders of IRGC whofought under him during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. These parties operatedin the same region in Iran —Kerman, the place where Mahan Air was first registered. Curiously,all those mentioned in the report now hold senior positions at Mahan Air while still being members of the IRGC.Soona Samsami, the NCRI representative in Washington D.C., told Fox News that Mahan has transported forces, logistics and weaponry for the IRGC and Hezbollah between Iran, Syria and Lebanon. She said, “It is primarily used by the IRGC in general and the Qods Force in specific in transferring forces and equipment and regional mercenaries such as Hezbollah to Syria and Lebanon. This airline has played the most active role in the past six years during the war in Syria for such transportations.”Emanuele Ottolenghi, who does not have anything to do with the publication of the NCRI report, is an expert on Iran sanctions and its aviation sector. He told Fox News, “Mahan CEO Hamid Arabnejad Khanooki and QF (Qods Force) Commander Qassem Soleimani are both Kermanis. And Arabnejad is a former IRGC commander. It is not a formal relationship, but is based on informal bonds or origin, militancy and ideology.”Ottolenghi is senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington D.C.He has written widely on nonnuclear sanctions against Iran and has testified to Congress on the subject. He pointed to Executive Order 13224 signed by President George W. Bush shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks that gives the administration powerful tools to confront terrorist funding.(It) “allows them to target enablers and providers of material support to Mahan. Any company selling parts, offering maintenance services, can be hit by fines or sanctions. Same for those operating as cargo sales, general sales and ticket sales agents. Ditto for ground services suppliers at airports. These include fueling, baggage handling, crew services, catering, etc.”Ottolenghi continued, “Similarly the administration can sanction the Iranian airports whence Mahan troop flights to Syria leave. It can sanction the company that provides fuel to Mahan in Iran. If it knows banks involved in managing payments in Europe for Mahan Air’s transactions on these services, it can similarly sanction them or at least impose fines,” he said. “In short a lot more can be done.”Mahan Air was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2011 for providing material support to the IRGC’s Qods Force in 2011, and again in 2016 to four entities that had helped Mahan skirt the sanctions regime placed against it. Several airlines that had been on the list were removed following the 2015 Iran nuclear deal —Mahan Air remained on it.“In short, Mahan Air is the pseudo name for ‘IRGC Air.’ This front carrier is a primary asset in the IRGC’s fueling of Iran’s belligerence across the region,” Heshmat Alavi, an Iranian political analyst and activist, said.Alavi told Fox News about the airlines goals: "Thisincludes transferring recruited Afghans and Pakistanis to provide foot-soldiers and cannon fodders in Iran’s campaign of propping the Assad regime in Syria.”Headded that following President Trump’s sanctioning of the IRGC for its support of terrorism the administration needs to hit back at Iranian intransigence. “The Trump administration’s IRGC blacklisting needs full-throttle implementation and patching all loopholes left behind from the Obama-era. One major step is to clip the IRGC’s wings and bring an urgent end to Iran’s footprints throughout the Middle East and beyond,” he said.Ben Evansky reports for Fox Newson the United Nations and international affairs.He can befollowed@BenEvansky', 'Israel Endorsed Kurdish Independence. Saladin Would Have Been Proud. - The New York TimesJERUSALEM — With a two-sentence statement supporting the Iraqi Kurds’ plan to hold a referendum on independence this Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put Israel at odds with nearly every other major player in the Middle East.Mr. Netanyahu, who endorsed not only the referendum but also the establishment of a Kurdish state, had ample strategic reason: A breakaway Kurdistan could prove valuable to Israel against Iran, which has oppressed its own Kurdish population.But given the interwoven history and shared emotion underlying his statement, present-day geopolitics can seem almost beside the point.The Kurds and the Jews, it turns out, go way back.Back past the Babylonian Captivity, in fact: The first Jews in Kurdistan, tradition holds, were among the last tribes of Israel, taken from their land in the eighth century B.C. They liked it there so much that when Cyrus the Great of Persia conquered the Babylonians and let the Jews go back home, many chose instead to stick around.Sixteen centuries later, Saladin, a Kurd, treated the Jews humanely after he conquered Jerusalem, and notably hired a Jewish doctor, Maimonides, as his physician.In the modern era, Kurdish Jews departed en masse for Israel when the Jewish state was created in 1948, leaving Kurdish civil society so bereft that some recall its leaders still lamenting the Jewish exodus decades later.Ties between the two have only grown warmer and more vital since the 1960s, as Israel and the Kurds — both minorities in an inhospitable region and ever in need of international allies — have repeatedly come to each other’s aid. The Kurds have long patterned their lobbying efforts in Washington on those of Israel’s supporters.And while Kurdish leaders have not publicly embraced Israel in the run-up to the referendum, for fear of antagonizing the Arab world, the Israeli flag can routinely be seen at Kurdish rallies in Erbil and across Europe.The Kurds in turn have friends and supporters all across Israel, including some 200,000 Kurdish Jews. But 83-year-old Tzuri Sagi, a retired brigadier general, has more reason than most Israelis to root for Kurdish independence.In the winter of 1966, Mr. Sagi’s commanders sent him on a secret mission, via Israel’s then-ally, Iran, to aid Mullah Mustafa Barzani and his pesh merga rebels in Iraqi Kurdistan. Six Iraqi army brigades were standing by to overwhelm the Kurds when the snow melted. Mr. Sagi, a lieutenant colonel, drew up defenses for Barzani’s lightly armed fighters. When those collapsed, Mr. Sagi advised the Kurds to allow the best of the Iraqi brigades to break out — right into an ambush.The 5,000-man Iraqi brigade was wiped out, and the battle, on Mount Handrin, became a landmark in Kurdish history. Mr. Sagi recalls Iraqi officers driving up in two jeeps waving white flags.“They said to the Kurds, ‘What do you want?’” he recalled.Over the years, Israeli doctors set up a field hospital for the Kurds, its soldiers trained the pesh merga fighters and the Mossad helped arm them.After Israel’s defeat of its Arab neighbors in 1967 and the Baathist coup in Iraq a year later, Iraq became inhospitable to its dwindling Jewish population. Then it was the Barzanis’ turn to help.After nine Jews were hanged in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square in 1969, Iraqi Jews were desperate to flee. The Kurds helped some 1,000 of them escape, over land to Iran and then by plane to Israel.“They were going on donkeys, through the mountains,” said Ofra Bengio, a pre-eminent historian of the Kurds and professor emerita at Tel Aviv University’s Moshe Dayan Center.One of the escapees was Zamir Shemtov, 63, now a dentist in Herzliya, who was a teenager in 1970 when his parents and extended family made their first attempt to flee Iraq. Arrested and locked up for a month, they tried again, but this time they were blackmailed, robbed, caught by the army and sent back to Baghdad, where his father was brutally interrogated, Mr. Shemtov said. Released two months later, they tried to get out a third time. This time, a Kurdish taxi driver ushered them to a safe meeting point where a young uniformed Kurdish fighter loaded them in his jeep and ferried them across the border into Iran.Mr. Shemtov said that near the end of the drive, his father offered the fighter his gold watch in gratitude.“The young man answered, ‘I am Masoud Barzani, son of Mullah Barzani, and if Mullah would hear that I took a watch, he would hang me!’” Mr. Shemtov recalled. “‘Instead, all I ask as thanks is that you remember us well in the future.’”A few years later, the young Masoud Barzani succeeded his father as head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party. Since 2005, he has been president of Iraqi Kurdistan.Mr. Sagi, who returned to aid the pesh merga against Iraq in 1974, said he traveled around Kurdistan quite a bit in those years, posing as a British journalist despite what can generously be called a tenuous command of English. “Sometimes I would tease the Kurds, and say negative things about Israel,” he said. “It always made them angry. They’d say that Israelis and the Jews are the best in the region.”Mr. Sagi said such sentiments stirred a reciprocal feeling in him: “I became a patriotic Kurd.”He was not alone: The story goes that Israeli soldiers and Mossad agents wept when the shah of Iran double-crossed the Kurds by signing the Algiers Accord with Iraq, a 1975 resolution of border disputes that ended the Kurdish rebellion and forced the pesh merga to retreat into Iran.Today, as the Kurds take a step they hope will realize a national dream of an independent state, they have been increasingly isolated.Iraqis oppose the Kurdish referendum because they want to keep their country intact. Iran and Turkey fear it will escalate separatist ambitions among their Kurdish minorities. And a coalition of powers, along with the United Nations Security Council, fear the referendum could disrupt military efforts to defeat the Islamic State.But Mr. Netanyahu had little to lose from his endorsement of the referendum, experts say.“Israel is desperate for friends in the region, the Kurds generally want to be friends, and they don’t care about Palestine,” said Kenneth M. Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst and National Security Council official who visits Kurdistan frequently.Moreover, Israel stands to gain a potentially valuable ally in its struggle with Iran, he said.“Iraqi and Iranian Kurds have deep ties,” he said. “And to create trouble for Iran, one way is to encourage independence for Iranian Kurds. The Iranians are terrified and furious about exactly that: that the Israelis are doing it, and that an independent Kurdistan will be a base for Israeli operations against Iran, via Iran’s Kurdish population.”While United States policy is to try to preserve Iraq as one entity, the Israelis are more practical, said Peter W. Galbraith, a former diplomat with extensive experience in Kurdistan: “Why lose all of Iraq, when you could save part of it?”At bottom, though, analysts and ordinary Israelis alike seem invariably to land on moral and emotional arguments for supporting the Kurds, often sounding much like Mr. Shemtov, the Iraqi-born dentist.“Our two nations have fought against all odds when those surrounding us wanted to destroy us,” he said. “From my perspective, if there is a lone sign of light in Islam, it is the Kurds.”He says he owes his life to them.“They saved us,” he said. “My dream now is that they declare independence, and I come to Erbil and salute while their anthem plays.”', '                                    Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends the Future Investment initiative conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 24, 2017.

It will clamp down further on the North's access to banks and other financial institutions and, more importantly, deepen the stigma any potential trading partners will have to take into account before doing business with Pyongyang.Even though many of the punishments against North Korea have already been enacted under previous sanctions measures, putting any country on the list is a very serious move by Washington. There are only three other countries on the list: Sudan, Iran and Syria. Cuba, which had been on the list from 1982, was removed by then-President Barack Obama in 2015.But how exactly does the terrorism charge fit North Korea? And how does North Korea compare to the other countries on the list?Here's a look, country by country:___NORTH KOREAIn the 1980s, North Korea was particularly active in deadly acts of terrorism, including a bombing in Myanmar that killed South Korean Cabinet members and the downing of a South Korean commercial airliner. It was blacklisted in 1988, but delisted in 2008 as Washington tried to entice it into a nuclear deal.The most glaring recent case of what could be seen as terrorism backed by North Korea is the assassination of leader Kim Jong Un's estranged half brother last February at the international airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Two young Southeast Asian women are now on trial for allegedly carrying out the killing, but authorities believe the plot was masterminded by North Korean agents who recruited, trained and supplied the women with the extremely toxic VX poison used in the assassination.VX is a sophisticated nerve agent that is almost exclusively produced with state backing for military use. Moreover, the U.S. has accused the North of involvement in several highly disruptive cyber incidents that could fall into the terrorism rubric.___SYRIASyria has been on the blacklist since the designation was created in 1979. According to the U.S., Bashar Assad's regime supports a variety of terrorist groups that have a destabilizing effect well beyond the region. In particular, according to the U.S., it provides political and weapons support to Lebanon-based Hezbollah, while helping Iran to keep the group armed.The U.S. claim against Syria also includes concerns about weapons of mass destruction — according to the State Department, it has used chemical weapons repeatedly against its own people.___IRANIran's listing goes back to 1984. A State Department report in July called Iran the world's foremost sponsor of terrorism and said it has supported Shia militias in Iraq and attempted to smuggle weapons to Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza.The WMD issue, also a factor with North Korea and Syria, has been cited by the State Department regarding Iran because of the proliferation threat posed by its nuclear program.___SUDANThis East African nation, home to Osama bin Laden for several years in the 1990s, made the blacklist in 1993. But along with the terrorism links, and a president who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on genocide charges, the State Department has asserted that Sudan's government flouts the rule of law and lets its security forces commit abuses with impunity.The U.S. government, however, has recently credited Sudan with some improvements. Just before leaving office, Obama issued an executive order that lifted decades-old sanctions on a probationary basis. Trump formalized that last month and is reportedly willing to delist Sudan if improvements continue.", 'Amb.

Each time, the U.S. has certified the deal.But Trump more recently has said he does not expect to certify Iran\'s compliance with an Oct. 15 deadline looming.Fox News’ John Roberts and Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'Help Wanted: Top Diplomat Sought - The New York TimesRex Tillerson’s tenure as secretary of state has been tumultuous, damaging to American foreign policy and his department. And, one can reasonably speculate, more unpleasant and unsatisfying than not for Mr. Tillerson himself.Successful secretaries of state tend to have respectful relationships with their boss. The Trump-Tillerson partnership failed miserably as the president soured on the former ExxonMobil C.E.O. and marginalized him in policymaking. A relationship in which Mr. Tillerson privately called President Trump a “moron” and Mr. Trump publicly faulted Mr. Tillerson for “wasting his time” on North Korea seemed destined to end badly.Mr. Tillerson has approached his job more as an efficiency-driven management consultant than as the nation’s senior diplomat and spokesman to the world. He has undermined the institution of diplomacy by advocating a 30 percent cut in the State Department budget and trying to push out 2,000 career diplomats, has shown little interest in explaining American positions at home or abroad and has done little to counter the steady erosion of trust in America’s historic role as a global leader, which Mr. Trump has brought about by his indifference to old alliances and his courtship of despots and strongmen.Yet, amid reports that Mr. Tillerson may soon be forced out of his job, the people thought to be front-runners in any shake-up of the administration’s national security team are cause for concern and, potentially, every bit as inimical to the national interest. Although other names are said to be in play, C.I.A. Director Mike Pompeo is reportedly the top choice to succeed Mr. Tillerson at State while Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, is a leading contender to replace Mr. Pompeo.Mr. Pompeo, by all accounts, has a much closer relationship with Mr. Trump than Mr. Tillerson has, impressing the president during daily intelligence briefings and becoming a trusted adviser even on issues outside his formal portfolio, like health care. He would almost certainly have more influence with Mr. Trump than Mr. Tillerson has managed to muster.The problem is that Mr. Pompeo may be too chummy. A former member of the House from Kansas, a Tea Party conservative and a climate change skeptic, Mr. Pompeo has never shed his partisan clothing. In principle, the C.I.A. director is expected to leave politics aside and lead the agency with a focus on gathering solid intelligence and providing unvarnished analysis. But Mr. Pompeo has not been shy about mixing politics with intelligence and policy and may feel even freer to do so at the State Department.Like Mr. Trump, he has played down the extent of Russia’s intervention in the presidential election and indeed has been at odds with the intelligence community on this issue. He is also a fervent critic of Iran, insisting that the 2015 nuclear deal negotiated between Iran and six major powers, including the United States, should be scrapped. He is considered among the administration’s toughest hawks on North Korea.For all his faults, Mr. Tillerson has tried to pursue diplomacy to end the nuclear crisis with North Korea and has certified Iran as complying with its commitments under the nuclear deal, a decision that has infuriated Mr. Trump. He has also been more skeptical than Mr. Trump about Moscow, and while he cultivated close ties with President Vladimir Putin when he ran ExxonMobil, as recently as Tuesday he declared in a speech, “We, together with our friends in Europe, recognize the active threat of a recently resurgent Russia.”Mr. Cotton, like Mr. Pompeo, has been a stalwart defender of Mr. Trump, prompting similar concerns about his ability to lead the intelligence agency in an independent, nonpartisan way. He also has no experience managing a large organization. A hard-line conservative and leading Republican Senate voice on national security, Mr. Cotton is widely viewed as bright, but he lacks career intelligence experience. This could compromise his ability to push back against political pressure from the White House.There are other negatives. Mr. Cotton has mocked the idea that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the presidential election. He does not seem to view waterboarding as torture, raising the prospect that he might reintroduce that barbaric practice, even though the Obama administration, human rights advocates and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis have all said that it violates international law and harms American interests. He has also been Congress’s most aggressive opponent of the Iran nuclear deal, adding one more voice to the chorus of senior officials trying to undo the agreement.These appointments would add two more white men to a cabinet dominated by them, and two more senior officials with military backgrounds to a national security team that is already top-heavy with them. Mr. Cotton is a decorated Army veteran who served in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr. Pompeo is a retired Army officer who graduated from West Point. Military experience can be valuable, but not to the point of overwhelming the civilians.In the final analysis, the people who fill cabinet jobs are a reflection of the president, his values and his priorities. And, in the end, the problems with American foreign policy arise from that very same person.', "Amb. John Bolton offers insight on President Trump's upcoming decision.EXCLUSIVE  – President Donald Trump is expected this week to “decertify” the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), better known simply as the Iran deal, declaring that the agreement reached in 2015 by the U.S. and five other international powers is not in America’s national interest. The matter will then be tossed back to Congress, which will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose hefty pre-2015 sanctions.While the President’s likely move has generated wide condemnation from foreign policy leaders —who reiterate that the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has maintained Iran is in compliance —a new 52-page investigative report by theNational Council of Resistance of Iran(NCRI), entitled: “Iran’s Nuclear Core: Uninspected Military Sites,” obtained exclusively by Fox News and slated for release Wednesday, asserts that the country’s nuclear weapons program has far from halted.“It has been known for years that Iran has two nuclear programs —one is civilian and the other, the military, has the goal of giving Iran its first nuclear bomb,” Alireza Jafarzadeh, deputy director of the Washington office of the NCRI, also referred to as the Iranian Resistance, and considered the primary opposition coalition to the clerical administration of Iran, told Fox News. “The civilian sector of the nuclear program has systematically provided a plausible logistical cover for the military sector, and acts as a conduit for it. The military aspect of the program has been and remains at the heart of Iran’s nuclear activities.”The Iranian Resistance has been monitoring the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-controlled entity tasked with building the nuclear bomb, the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (Sazman-e Pazhouheshhaye Novin-e Defa’i), known by its Persian acronym SPND, for nearly two decades. SPND is comprised of 7 subdivisions, each of which carries out a certain portion of nuclear weapons research.The unit responsible for conducting research and building a trigger for a nuclear weapon is called the Center for Research and Expansion of Technologies for Explosion and Impact (Markaz-e Tahghighat va Tose’e Fanavari-e Enfejar va Zarbeh), known by its acronym METFAZ.Since April 2017, when the NCRI found out about a new military location being used by SPND, the coalition has focused its attention on all the potential SPND sites that we suspected were tasked with building the bomb. The NCRI’s investigation inside Iran was conducted by the network associated with the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), which was responsible for blowing the cover off the program, particularly since 2002.“The more we investigated, the more we realized that the weaponization program is fully operational,” Jafarzadeh said. “The military sector has gone through changes in name, location and reorganizations over the years. However, it has never halted its work and key figures in the sector have remained unchanged.”The IAEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report but has maintained that Iran remains in compliance with the terms of the agreement. The IAEA Director-General Yukia Amano stated in Vienna last month that they have all the access they require, and that the verification process is a “robust” one. He also said the agency does not differentiate between military and civilian sites.Meanwhile, the U.S State Department did not immediately respond to a request for further comment on the matter.One of the key issues of the verification process, the report states, has been access to Iran’s military sites. The regime’s highest officials — from Ali-Akbar Velayti, a foreign policy advisor to Ali Khamenei, the current Supreme Leader of Iran, to Gholam-Hossein Sa’edi, brigadier general of Iran’s elite IRGC, have stated publicly over the past month that they will continue to refuse to allow IAEA inspections of their military sites.Parchin Military Complex at South East Tehran            “An important feature of the Iranian regime’s nuclear program is that several sites and centers where nuclear-related activities are conducted are situated in sprawling military complexes that also house scores of tunnels and silos. This not only makes IAEA access to these locations more difficult, but also makes it possible to relocate these centers and projects to other locations within the complex,” Jafarzadeh explained. “As such, if it becomes necessary to relocate a project or center, it can easily be moved to a different silo or tunnel within the parameters of the military site. This makes pinpointing the exact location of nuclear research and activities more challenging, and reduces the chance of exposure.”Plan 6 Zeinoddin in Parchin military complex            As detailed in the report, the Iranian Resistance has identified four major sites that “with high degrees of certainty” have been involved in various aspects of the allegedly ongoing nuclear weapons project.Plan 6 of Parchin as well as other sections in the vicinity            The first one pinpointed is Pazhouheshkadeh, located at the Parchin military complex 30 miles southeast Tehran, which the report claims has in recent times become the main center for METFAZ’s tests. Parchin, where the country’s military Research Academy is situated, is a sprawling military district run by the Defense Ministry with 12 military and missile complexes. The Defense Ministry refers to each of these units as a “plan,” and the METFAZ center is said to be placed at Plan 6 —officially part of the chemical industries of Parchin complex —a fully IRGC-protected and -fenced in 500-acre parcel.General area of Khojir            “To conceal the true nature of its work, the Research Academy conducts its research and activities under the cover of conventional research. However, the Research Academy itself is completely independent and closed off,” the report mandates, adding that since the end of 2015 the IAEA is able to have “very limited access with all sorts of restrictions” to that area inside Parchin.Parking entrance for Nouri Industry            The report then distinguishes the Nouri Industrial site, situated at the completely secure Khojir military complex southeast of Tehran and spanning 75 square miles.“The project to actively pursue production of nuclear warheads is conducted in Khojir by the Hemmat Missile Industries Group,” the report notes. “Due to the extreme sensitivity of manufacturing nuclear warheads, Nouri Industry has its own security and military police; individuals who have clearance to other parts of Khojir site are not allowed to go to this section.”Intelligence findings also reveal that “scores of large underground tunnels have been constructed in this military complex,” this providing “the possibility and flexibility of covering up the activities of the warhead project, or transferring it to a different location in the complex.” Furthermore, the Iranian Resistance states that North Korean experts cooperate with the regime’s experts in the project, and have been “particularly helpful in designing the aerodynamics aspects, the shape of the warhead, and have also provided the design for the Hemmat site, its tunnels, and underground centers.”IRANIAN EX-PATS RALLY WHILE ROUHANI RAILSThird, the report claims that the Hafte Tir site — which belongs to the Defense Ministry and is positioned in the military zone near the city of Isfahan, in a mountainous region adjacent to the Isfahan-Shiraz highway six miles from the town of Mobarakeh — is constructed with underground tunnels under the supervision of SPND under the supervision of IRGC Brigadier General Mohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi.“In addition to all its security advantages and its location far removed from public sight, it is part of a sprawling military complex which provides the possibility of relocating within the complex and covering up the transfer,” the report states. “The research site related to nuclear activities is located inside of a tunnel, which is about 0.4 miles and contains four galleries. Since Hafte Tir military industries in Isfahan constitutes a major part of the regime’s ammunition production, the cover of a conventional military site protects the work and keeps it secret.”Hafte Tir military Complex near Isfahan            INSIDE IRAN: WESTERN TOURISM A GROWING GOVERNMENT MONEY-MAKERHafte Tir Military Industrial Complex under the supervision of SPND            Workshops at the Hafte Tir reportedly were used in the past to produce centrifuge components, such as rotor cylinders, and it is believed that in addition to activities in the tunnels, the site “still has a capability to produce those components clandestinely.”NCRI exposed METFAZ location near Sanjarian Village in 2009.

Because Tehran is vulnerable domestically, such pressure would effectively empower the people of Iran and the organized opposition, who demand fundamental change and seek a secular, democratic, nonnuclear republic in Iran.”Nonetheless, the Iranian regime hasthreatened”crushing” retaliation if Trump does indeed decertify its compliance, a move likely to come before the October 15 deadline.Hollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

It produced a yield of 12 kilotons of equivalent TNT — a little less than what destroyed Hiroshima. Like the Hiroshima bomb, its fissile material was highly enriched uranium. However, its design was different. It used implosion to assemble the critical mass by compressing the sphere that was made of the fissile material.This became the universal design because of the speed at which a critical explosive mass can be assembled. The Hiroshima bomb developed a critical mass more primitively by shooting one subcritical piece into another using chemical explosives. The Chinese use of implosion employed the same technique used in the plutonium bomb dropped on Nagasaki. The precise design of this Chinese weapon is known because in late 2001 or early 2002, it was sold by the Pakistani proliferator A. Q. Khan to the Libyans, who subsequently turned it over to the C.I.A. The question is: Did Mr. Khan also sell it to Iran?The likelihood is that he did. And that is a powerful reason why President Trump must not back out of the nuclear deal with Iran when he is required to recertify the deal in October, as he has strongly hinted that he intends. If the deal is scrapped, Iran, nuclear design in hand, will be able to produce its first nuclear weapon in just months.This will be possible because Iran’s infrastructure for bomb building is already in place. In 1989, Mr. Khan began shipping centrifuge components to Iran. These were so called P1 centrifuges — an early Pakistan design. Later, when these centrifuges were inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency, they were found to contain traces of highly enriched uranium, which must have come from the Pakistani program.There is a limited amount of enrichment that a single centrifuge can produce, no matter how long it spins its charge of uranium hexafluoride gas. But when 164 centrifuges are arranged in cascades, with one stage of enrichment feeding into the next, enough uranium can be enriched to produce an atomic bomb. The Iranians, reverse engineering the technology they bought from Mr. Khan, not only manufactured their own centrifuges, but also mastered the cascade technology.But did Mr. Khan sell them the bomb design itself? It seems highly likely that he did, though it has never been confirmed. By 1989 Mr. Khan was running what was essentially a supermarket for nuclear technology. It was a moneymaking operation, done certainly with the knowledge of the Pakistan government. (When in the mid-1990s Mr. Khan began trading with the North Koreans, providing centrifuges for rockets, the goods were carried in Pakistani military aircraft.) He was trying to sell anything he could to anyone willing to buy, pocketing the money. So it is likely that from 1989 on, the Iranians had this design.Among other things, the Joint Agreement with Iran, the seven-party nuclear deal, forbids designing, developing, fabricating, acquiring or using detonation systems suitable for a bomb, unless it is for non-nuclear purposes and subject to monitoring.This provision is enforceable, but Iran will not allow I.A.E.A. inspection of the sensitive military complexes where such systems might be developed, such as at Parchin, a military base near Tehran suitable for testing high explosives. There is a suspicion that the Iranians did research on implosion there. The Trump administration argues that this refusal is clear evidence that the nuclear pact is useless and should be scrapped. My conclusion is just the opposite.If indeed, as seems likely, Iran already has the design for a nuclear weapon, it need only amass enough fissile material to complete the bomb. This is often described as the “breakout time.” Roughly speaking, a bomb needs about 28 kilograms of 90 percent enriched uranium, or about eight kilograms of plutonium. The Iranians are allowed to enrich only a total of 300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium, while you would need about 3,000 kilograms to produce enough highly enriched uranium to make a bomb. The Iranians also tried to produce plutonium in a reactor designed for that purpose near the city of Arak. Under the conditions of the nuclear pact this reactor is being completely reconfigured so it cannot be used for producing plutonium. This is one of the successes of the treaty.If the deal is scrapped, the Iranians could resume their centrifuge enrichment program, which is now being carefully monitored. Iran’s stock of highly enriched uranium could then grow, possibly within a few months, to provide enough for a weapon.If the Trump administration does not recertify the agreement when it comes around in just a few weeks, the rest of the signers may attempt to maintain the treaty. But without the United States, the Iranians have suggested that they will consider the provisions no longer binding. Shouldn’t the dire situation in North Korea be enough of a headache already that we do not want to deal with another nuclear armed country? One can only hope that Mr. Trump sees it that way.', '', 'Rodrigo Duterte, Iran, Rohingya: Your Tuesday Briefing - The New York TimesGood morning.

And they declared that the attack amounted to a declaration of war by Lebanon, a leap given that the weak Lebanese state does not control Hezbollah.At the same time, the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, unexpectedly flew to Riyadh and declared his resignation there on Saturday. Suspicions were growing among officials and diplomats in Beirut on Thursday that he had not only been pressured to do so by Saudi Arabia but was being held there against his will.Despite the worries, analysts, officials and diplomats said that although they were not privy to the thinking of the Saudi crown prince, it was far-fetched that Saudi Arabia would launch a military action against Lebanon, since it is already overstretched in a war it started two years ago against Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen.And Saudi Arabia has expressed displeasure with Lebanon this way before: This was at least the fourth time in five years that it asked its citizens to leave Lebanon.But even before the current crisis, fears were building in Lebanon that Israel — which shares Saudi Arabia’s goal of rolling back Iranian power — would instigate another war against Hezbollah to curtail the increased power, influence and weaponry the Lebanese group has accumulated while playing a decisive role in the war in neighboring Syria.Several Israeli officials seized on Mr. Hariri’s resignation — which he attributed to Iranian interference — as proof that Hezbollah, Iran and the Lebanese government were one and the same. That has fueled anxiety even as both Israel and Hezbollah insist that while they are prepared for a war, they do not want one now.Reaction in Washington on Thursday to Saudi Arabia’s decision to order its citizens out of Lebanon was also cautious.“I don’t think we’re on the brink of war, but it certainly constitutes an escalation,” said Andrew Exum, a former top Middle East policy official at the Pentagon, said in a telephone interview.The question was whether heightened tensions would start one anyway.Israeli officials, while cheering Prince Mohammed’s tough line on Iran, said they were uncertain that the crown prince was experienced or adroit enough to avoid setting off a broader regional conflict, perhaps one that could drag Israel in.“Israel has two objectives: to stop Iran’s path towards dominance and hegemony in the region, and to create an alliance of the rational players in the region that would include Israel,” said Naftali Bennett, the Israeli minister of education and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet. “That is certainly a positive development to have such an alignment. At the same time, we have to be very cautious to prevent an unnecessary escalation in the region.”Daniel B. Shapiro, a former United States ambassador to Israel, said more bluntly that it was one thing for Israel to see eye to eye with Saudi Arabia about who their adversaries were, “but it’s another to let a young, impulsive leader set the pace, when he won’t have to do all the fighting.”Adding to the confusion, no one professes to understand Saudi Arabia’s logic or goals in Lebanon. Mr. Hariri’s resignation, apparently aimed at isolating Hezbollah, seemed likely only to strengthen it and its allies. It has humiliated Mr. Hariri, Saudi Arabia’s main ally in the country, created a potentially destabilizing political crisis in Lebanon and given Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, an opportunity to appear the elder statesman, calling for calm and declaring that Mr. Hariri is welcome back any time.Some analysts suggested the Saudi escalation in Lebanon was less about making a dent in Hezbollah’s power and more a distraction from what appears to be a political purge at home and largely failed attempts to counter Iran in Syria and Yemen abroad. The developments fueled speculation that Prince Mohammed might be positioning himself to announce his accession to the throne.“Maybe he felt he could score easier points in Lebanon and say internally, ‘Look, I’m being tough against Hezbollah,’ ” said Michael Young, a Lebanese analyst. “All this suggests to me that the arrival of King Mohammed is going to be sooner than later.”Rather than war, analysts say Saudi Arabia’s next steps against Lebanon may be economic, like the boycott and blockade Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies are conducting against Qatar.Saudi Arabi and its allies could expel Lebanese citizens, close air routes, cut off diplomatic relations and demand that Hezbollah be thrown out of government or forced to disarm, the political blogger Elias Muhanna wrote.Those measures would be likely to hurt Hezbollah least, since unlike other parties and ordinary Lebanese, it can draw on extensive financial support from Iran.But none of that was reassuring to people in Lebanon, a country of about 6.2 million people that for most its history has been batted between regional and global powers, most recently between Saudi Arabia and Iran, that exploit its own internal divisions. The country survived a devastating war in 2006 when Hezbollah fought Israel to a draw.Lebanon was transfixed all week by the question of why Mr. Hariri had not come back or spoken to journalists or even many of his political allies and advisers. Lebanese followed social media sites late Wednesday night tracking a flight from Riyadh that they thought he might be on. He wasn’t.His political party, the Future Movement, stopped short of publicly agreeing with Hezbollah and its ally, President Michel Aoun, that Mr. Hariri was a hostage. But it issued a statement implying he was not operating under his own free will, referring to him as still being the prime minister.His return “is necessary to restore dignity and respect to Lebanon,” the statement said, stressing its support for his leadership and vowing “to follow him in whatever he decides.”Mr. Hariri, a dual citizen of Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, met the ambassadors of Britain and the European Union and the chargé d’affaires from the American Embassy on Wednesday and Thursday at his Riyadh residence. Other Western diplomats, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that those envoys, too, came away with the impression that he could not speak freely.The American ambassador to Lebanon, Elizabeth Richards, posted photographs of a meeting with Lebanese Army officials and emphasized international support for the Lebanese government.But President Trump in recent days has posted on Twitter messages of unspecified support for Saudi Arabia’s rulers, saying they “know exactly what they are doing.”Lebanon tried to handle the stress with its customary mix of jitters and jadedness. People debated whether to stock up on canned food for a coming war, but also ratcheted up the black humor.“Saudi Arabia should pay for our therapy,” Karim Traboulsi, an editor at the news site The New Arab, wrote in a post on Facebook.', 'BEIRUT – Saad Hariri has seen a lot in his 47 years.His father, Lebanon\'s charismatic leader and influential businessman Rafik Hariri, was assassinated in a 2005 bombing that rocked the country and thrust the young man into a political career before he was ready.He led an uprising that ended decades of Syrian military presence in Lebanon, and was later wanted by the government in Damascus for arming rebels seeking to overthrow President Bashar Assad.He was ousted as prime minister by the militant group Hezbollah in 2011 while meeting with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office; years later, he formed another unity government with the same group, which was implicated in his father\'s death.But the most bizarre twist came two weeks ago, when he was summoned to Riyadh by his patrons, the Saudi royal family. The next day, on Nov. 4, he resigned in a broadcast on Saudi TV.The man who has played a balancing act for years in Lebanon\'s delicate, sectarian-based political system was cast onto an unknown path, as was his country.Hariri finds himself caught between the region\'s two feuding powers, the Sunni kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Shiite Iran, raising questions about the fate of the dynasty that has been the face of politics for decades in Lebanon."In many ways, Saad is a copy of Rafik Hariri, with the difference in circumstances," said Paula Yacoubian, the Future TV anchor who interviewed Hariri on Sunday in his residence in Saudi Arabia, where many Lebanese believe he is being held against his will.His father was a self-made billionaire who amassed his construction fortune in Saudi Arabia and then helped rebuild a civil war-shattered Lebanon as prime minister. He was killed when his motorcade was struck by a truck bomb in Beirut on Feb. 14, 2005, and four Hezbollah members are being tried in absentia by a U.N.-backed court for the killing.The bombing immediately thrust Saad Hariri into the spotlight — and the political novice had to learn fast.With an international business degree from Georgetown University, he moved into his new role, but the shadow of his father was always there. For years during meetings, he kept a large portrait of his father sitting on an empty chair next to his. A pin of his father still adorns the lapel of his suits.Like his father, he lives in fear of being assassinated, traveling around town in elaborate security convoys.In his resignation speech from Riyadh, Hariri cited fears for his life as one reason for stepping down, in addition to blaming what he called meddling in the region by Iran and Hezbollah.The resignation caught Lebanon by surprise, and many believed that Hariri, a dual Lebanese-Saudi national, was coerced by the Saudis. Lebanese President Michel Aoun refused to accept it until he returned home to Beirut.In Sunday\'s interview of Hariri on Future TV, which is affiliated with his party, Yacoubian spent more than an hour trying to dispel speculation of coercion.A sad and weary Hariri was emotional at times in the broadcast, appearing to hold back tears and sparking sympathy for him. But the interview did little to ease suspicions and only increased calls for his return.Yacoubian said later that Hariri clearly seemed to be under pressure as he finds himself in a tough spot."Hariri is a kind man and politics sometimes needs foxes. ... He is a good man, that\'s what he is. Maybe in politics you shouldn\'t be that good," she said.The resignation, aiming to pressure coalition partner Hezbollah to stay out of regional affairs, instead has turned into a campaign for Hariri to return home and either formally resign or resume the job."If Hariri were a savvier politician, he could have used different words; he could have refused to resign, or insisted on doing so from Beirut," wrote Lebanon expert Thanassis Cambanis in the Atlantic.His resignation appears to have caused cracks within the family and the Future Movement he heads, as rumors circulate about possible replacements.In many ways, the soft-spoken Hariri has always been a stranger to Lebanon\'s intricate and sometimes violent politics.Despite his wealth and sudden political fame, he has stayed humble, and comes across as affable and warm. At lunches with journalists, he is relaxed, but guarded, often receiving his own separate healthy menu of grilled chicken and vegetables, before lighting a long cigar over coffee and dessert. On social media, he often posts smiling selfies with journalists and politicians.He ran in the annual Beirut Marathon and supported civil marriage, a popular cause stiffly rejected by conservative clergymen in Lebanon."I\'m one of the people," Hariri said in the interview, affectionately thanking them for calling for his return. "I\'m my father\'s son."While he was always critical of Hezbollah and Iran, he has found a way to work with them.In 2009, a Saudi and Syrian rapprochement after years of tension from the elder Hariri\'s assassination made it possible for the son to form a unity government. As part of easing strains, Saad Hariri had to meet Assad, whom he had accused of involvement in his father\'s killing. Yacoubian, who has interviewed him five times, said it was the only other time besides Sunday that she detected he was tense.In his first term as prime minister, Hariri served for over a year, filled with political stress arising from investigations into his father\'s death, which at the time he blamed on the Syrian government.In January 2010, Hezbollah ministers and their allies toppled Hariri\'s government by resigning from the national unity Cabinet, rendering him a lame duck just as he met with Obama in Washington.After the demonstrations against Assad turned into an armed rebellion, Syria issued a warrant for Hariri\'s arrest in December 2011 on charges of providing weapons to the Sunni rebels.For years, Hariri lived in self-imposed exile between Saudi Arabia and France, before he returned in 2016 to form a new unity government.In an article in The New York Times in September 2016, months before taking office, Hariri urged Iran to stop meddling in Arab affairs. His rhetoric against Iran and Hezbollah was not much different from his defiant words in the Nov. 4 resignation from Saudi Arabia."Iran can be part of the solution. But it must accept the extended Arab hand, led by Saudi Arabia, for normalized, neighborly relations, allowing Sunni Arabs to get down to the real task of getting rid of extremism," Hariri wrote.In December 2016, another tacit agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran made Hariri prime minister again in a coalition government that included Hezbollah. It was yet another uneasy partnership that seemed to teeter on the edge of collapse, particularly as Hezbollah became more assertive in the region.Still, in the days before he resigned, Hariri was enthusiastic about economic progress, tweeting and posting about parliamentary elections expected in the spring, and stressing the need for national unity above all else.Hariri\'s last meeting in Lebanon before he was summoned to Saudi Arabia was with an adviser to Iran\'s supreme leader. Speculation has been rife that the meeting was the reason for Riyadh\'s surprise summoning. In the interview with Yacoubian, Hariri said he told Ali Akbar Velayati to end Iran\'s meddling in Arab affairs.His comment prompted a back and forth with Velayati. What is clear is that Hariri got caught between the region\'s two feuding powers.Hariri "wanted to mediate between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and we welcomed it," Velayati said.', 'BEIRUT – Saad Hariri has seen a lot in his 47 years.His father, Lebanon\'s charismatic leader and influential businessman Rafik Hariri, was assassinated in a 2005 bombing that rocked the country and thrust the young man into a political career before he was ready.He led an uprising that ended decades of Syrian military presence in Lebanon, and was later wanted by the government in Damascus for arming rebels seeking to overthrow President Bashar Assad.He was ousted as prime minister by the militant group Hezbollah in 2011 while meeting with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office; years later, he formed another unity government with the same group, which was implicated in his father\'s death.But the most bizarre twist came two weeks ago, when he was summoned to Riyadh by his patrons, the Saudi royal family. The next day, on Nov. 4, he resigned in a broadcast on Saudi TV.The man who has played a balancing act for years in Lebanon\'s delicate, sectarian-based political system was cast onto an unknown path, as was his country.Hariri finds himself caught between the region\'s two feuding powers, the Sunni kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Shiite Iran, raising questions about the fate of the dynasty that has been the face of politics for decades in Lebanon."In many ways, Saad is a copy of Rafik Hariri, with the difference in circumstances," said Paula Yacoubian, the Future TV anchor who interviewed Hariri on Sunday in his residence in Saudi Arabia, where many Lebanese believe he is being held against his will.His father was a self-made billionaire who amassed his construction fortune in Saudi Arabia and then helped rebuild a civil war-shattered Lebanon as prime minister. He was killed when his motorcade was struck by truck bomb in Beirut on Feb. 14, 2005, and four Hezbollah members are being tried in absentia by a U.N.-backed court for the killing.The bombing immediately thrust Saad Hariri — and the political novice had to learn fast.With an international business degree from Georgetown University, he moved into his new role, but the shadow of his father was always there. For years during meetings, he kept a large portrait of his father sitting on an empty chair next to his. A pin of his father still adorns the lapel of his suits.Like his father, he lives in fear of being assassinated, traveling around town in elaborate security convoys.In his resignation speech from Riyadh, Hariri cited fears for his life as one reason for stepping down, in addition to blaming what he called meddling in the region by Iran and Hezbollah.The resignation caught Lebanon by surprise, and many believed that Hariri, a dual Lebanese-Saudi national, was coerced by the Saudis. Lebanese President Michel Aoun refused to accept it until he returned home to Beirut.In Sunday\'s interview of Hariri on Future TV, which is affiliated with his party, Yacoubian spent more than an hour trying to dispel speculation of coercion.A sad and weary Hariri was emotional at times in the broadcast, appearing to hold back tears and sparking sympathy for him. But the interview did little to ease suspicions and only increased calls for his return.Yacoubian said later that Hariri clearly seemed to be under pressure as he finds himself in a tough spot."Hariri is a kind man and politics sometimes needs foxes. ... He is a good man, that\'s what he is. Maybe in politics you shouldn\'t be that good," she said.The resignation, aiming to pressure coalition partner Hezbollah to stay out of regional affairs, instead has turned into a campaign for Hariri to return home and either formally resign or resume the job."If Hariri were a savvier politician, he could have used different words; he could have refused to resign, or insisted on doing so from Beirut," wrote Lebanon expert Thanassis Cambanis in the Atlantic.His resignation appears to have caused cracks within the family and the Future Movement he heads, as rumors circulate about possible replacements.In many ways, the soft-spoken Hariri has always been a stranger to Lebanon\'s intricate and sometimes violent politics.Despite his wealth and sudden political fame, he has stayed humble, and comes across as affable and warm. At lunches with journalists, he is relaxed, but guarded, often receiving his own separate healthy menu of grilled chicken and vegetables, before lighting a long cigar over coffee and dessert. On social media, he often posts smiling selfies with journalists and politicians.He ran in the annual Beirut Marathon and supported civil marriage, a popular cause stiffly rejected by conservative clergymen in Lebanon."I\'m one of the people," Hariri said in the interview, affectionately thanking them for calling for his return. "I\'m my father\'s son."While he was always critical of Hezbollah and Iran, he has found a way to work with them.In 2009, a Saudi and Syrian rapprochement after years of tension from the elder Hariri\'s assassination made it possible for the son to form a unity government. As part of easing strains, Saad Hariri had to meet Assad, whom he had accused of involvement in his father\'s killing. Yacoubian, who has interviewed him five times, said it was the only other time besides Sunday that she detected he was tense.In his first term as prime minister, Hariri served for over a year, filled with political stress arising from investigations into his father\'s death, which at the time he blamed on the Syrian government.In January 2010, Hezbollah ministers and their allies toppled Hariri\'s government by resigning from the national unity Cabinet, rendering him a lame duck just as he met with Obama in Washington.After the demonstrations against Assad turned into an armed rebellion, Syria issued a warrant for Hariri\'s arrest in December 2011 on charges of providing weapons to the Sunni rebels.For years, Hariri lived in self-imposed exile between Saudi Arabia and France, before he returned in 2016 to form a new unity government.In an article in The New York Times in September 2016, months before taking office, Hariri urged Iran to stop meddling in Arab affairs.

Mr. Zarrab, Mr. Atilla, and seven other defendants were charged with participating in a billion-dollar scheme to smuggle gold for oil in violation of the Iran sanctions.On Tuesday, in his opening statement to the jury, the prosecutor said the men had used front companies and false documentation, told lies to American officials and paid bribes at the highest levels of the Turkish government.“These are serious federal crimes that compromise our national security,” the prosecutor, David W. Denton Jr., said. He indicated that Mr. Zarrab would testify against Mr. Atilla and “tell you the story firsthand, as he lived it.”“The evidence is going to pull back the curtain on a fraud of truly global proportions,” Mr. Denton said, “billions of Iranian dollars moving in a scheme so large that it affected the economies of countries in the Middle East, and so large that it was protected by government ministers in Turkey and Iran.”Mr. Zarrab’s decision to cooperate could further strain relations between the United States and Turkey, especially if Mr. Zarrab reveals evidence of corruption in Turkish government and banking circles.The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has already raised the case with American officials, including in a telephone call with President Trump in September. He has depicted the prosecution as a continuation of a 2016 coup attempt against him, which he has laid to followers of the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is living in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania.“When that plot failed, they set up the same plot in the U.S.,” Mr. Erdogan told Parliament this month.The seven other defendants charged by the United States, who all remain at large, prosecutors have said, include a former Turkish economy minister, Zafer Caglayan, and Suleyman Aslan, a former general manager of Halkbank, a state-owned bank that prosecutors have depicted as playing a major role in the scheme.Mr. Zarrab, 34, had “a direct line” to both men, Mr. Denton said.Halkbank, in a statement in Turkey, dismissed news media speculation that it might be subject to prosecution in the case and said all its business had been conducted in accordance with national and international regulations.In 2013, the Turkish police said they had uncovered the bribery scheme and arrested Mr. Zarrab, Mr. Aslan and others. But, Mr. Denton told the jury, bribes “bought a cover-up.”Turkish officials, he said, organized a purge of the police and prosecutors who had run the case, sent many of them to jail and shut down the investigation. Mr. Zarrab and others were released.Mr. Denton said that “the same corrupt high-ranking Turkish officials instructed Zarrab to put up even more bribe money for the judges, millions and millions in bribes, so that everything could be made to go away.”“Zarrab paid the money,” Mr. Denton said, “co-conspirators got out of jail, and the case the Turkish police had developed was dismissed.”But it turned out that the Turkish police were not the only ones watching, Mr. Denton said. Since 2013, he said, the F.B.I.’s counterintelligence division had been running its own investigation.“The F.B.I. pieced together what was going on,” Mr. Denton said, “and the evidence they found tells the same story that the evidence collected by the Turkish police did.”On Tuesday, the Turkish authorities were again taking measures, this time in response to the case in New York.The chief prosecutor in Istanbul issued an arrest warrant for a former opposition legislator, Aykan Erdemir. He was accused of supplying fake evidence to United States authorities in connection with the Zarrab case.Mr. Erdemir is a Turkey expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based group that has strongly criticized Iran. The group’s chief executive, Mark Dubowitz, testified for the prosecution in the Zarrab case on Tuesday about the history of the Iran sanctions.Mr. Erdemir, in a statement, called the Turkish charges against him false, defamatory and “entirely political in nature” and said, “The Turkish government has a regrettable history of harassing and intimidating critics and experts.”In court on Tuesday, the government asked the judge, Richard M. Berman, to unseal court papers related to Mr. Zarrab’s guilty plea. They show that he also pleaded guilty to money laundering, bank fraud and a bribery conspiracy charge.The bribery charge, which prosecutors had not previously made public, relates to payments Mr. Zarrab made to a corrections officer at the federal jail in New York where he was being held to induce officers to smuggle contraband in for him, including cellphones and alcohol.Mr. Atilla’s lawyer, Victor J. Rocco, told the jury that Mr. Zarrab had also paid bribes in the jail to gain access to women.A spokesman for the jail declined to comment on the specifics of the incidents but said, “All cases of inmate misconduct are investigated accordingly and appropriate action is taken.”Mr. Rocco, in the defense’s opening statement, said his client was not corrupt, had taken no bribes and was a “hard-working person,” like the jurors themselves. Mr. Atilla, 47, was the bank’s deputy general manager for international banking.Mr. Rocco signaled that the defense’s strategy would be to attack the credibility of Mr. Zarrab’s testimony. Mr. Rocco said Mr. Zarrab had paid “fortunes in bribes” to businessmen and government leaders in Russia, China, Iran and Turkey “to get what he wanted.”“To Zarrab, bribery was a way of life,” Mr. Rocco said. “To Zarrab, everyone has a price.”', '', 'Saudi Arabia Comes for Hezbollah - The New York TimesLebanon was stunned on Nov. 4 when its prime minister, Saad Hariri, speaking from Saudi Arabia, delivered a halting resignation speech. Mr. Hariri said he left Beirut because he feared assassination. He placed the blame for his long-distance resignation on Iran and its main ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah.In the days since, Saudi Arabia has accused Hezbollah of plotting against the kingdom and ordered Saudi citizens to leave Lebanon. Threats from top Saudi officials are causing new turmoil in a tiny country with complicated sectarian politics, failed power-sharing arrangements and a long history of foreign meddling.Since the Arab uprisings in 2011, Lebanon has largely avoided the conflicts sweeping the Middle East. Even the war that is raging in Syria, Lebanon’s much larger neighbor, has generally left the country unscathed. That calm is now threatened as the Trump administration and Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab allies set their sights on Hezbollah and its patron, Iran.Why would Saudi leaders risk a new conflagration? They see a way to make common cause with Washington by targeting Hezbollah, one of Iran’s most effective allies. President Trump has consistently singled out Iran’s support for Hezbollah and other groups that Washington considers terrorist organizations.But Saudi Arabia is already overstretched. Its war against Houthi rebels in Yemen drags on, and the diplomatic dispute with Qatar remains in a stalemate, too. If Saudi leaders think they can score an easy victory in Lebanon against Hezbollah, it will be another misjudgment that adds to a dangerous and combustible moment in the Middle East.Hezbollah was part of Lebanon’s national unity government formed in late 2016 with Mr. Hariri as the prime minister. Iran and Saudi Arabia — which views itself as the protector of Lebanon’s Sunni community — blessed the power-sharing agreement.Hezbollah agreed to the deal because it wanted to avoid conflict in Lebanon and to direct its energy toward the Syrian war, where it fights alongside the government of President Bashar al-Assad. As a leader with strong ties to both the Sunni Arab states and the West, Mr. Hariri provided Hezbollah with political cover as it continued to dominate Lebanon.The militia’s important role in the fighting in Syria has made it more powerful than ever. But Mr. Hariri’s resignation exposes Hezbollah and its allies in the Lebanese government to harsher United States sanctions, a potential war with Israel or even an economic blockade led by Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab allies, similar to the one imposed on Qatar.Hezbollah, which was founded in the 1980s during a civil war and an Israeli invasion, is now the country’s dominant political and military force. It is unrealistic of Saudi leaders and the Trump administration to expect that it can be supplanted by a popular Lebanese groundswell against it or removed by a foreign military force without causing catastrophic damage to Lebanon.Saudi Arabia’s new ruler, King Salman, and his son and designated heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are pursuing a far more aggressive foreign policy than previous Saudi rulers. They have been bolstered in this by Mr. Trump’s support for the kingdom in its conflict with Iran. Now that Iran’s ally, Mr. Assad, has essentially won the civil war in Syria, Saudi Arabia is looking to contain Iranian influence elsewhere. Lebanon is a tempting target.The Saudis have also been emboldened by their recent outreach to Shiite factions in Iraq, especially the nationalist cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who visited the kingdom in July and met with Prince Mohammed. The Saudis are hoping to cultivate Mr. Sadr and other Shiite leaders who can be a counterweight to Iranian influence in Iraq, especially ahead of parliamentary elections next year.But the Saudis won’t be able to find a Sadr in Lebanon, a political figure who can offer a serious alternative to Hezbollah and Iranian influence in the Shiite community.Since the end of Lebanon’s civil war in 1990, Hezbollah has entrenched itself in the largely Shiite areas of southern Beirut and southern Lebanon. With Iranian support, it opened schools and hospitals, provided business loans and fielded candidates for parliamentary elections. It also extended its military capability, deploying thousands of missiles along the border with Israel.In February 2005, Rafik Hariri, a billionaire construction tycoon and Lebanon’s former prime minister, was assassinated in a bombing in Beirut. His death deprived Lebanon of its most prominent Sunni leader — and Saudi Arabia lost its most important Lebanese ally. After Mr. Hariri’s death, his son Saad took over his father’s Saudi-based construction empire and the Sunni political mantle in Lebanon.In the summer of 2006, Hezbollah fought a monthlong war with Israel, which ended in a draw and increased the militia’s popularity across the Muslim world. But by early 2011, Hezbollah’s standing began to wane after a United Nations tribunal indicted several of its members for Mr. Hariri’s assassination.If Mr. Hariri’s killing was a first salvo of the proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Lebanon, subsequent battles also did not go Riyadh’s way.In May 2008, Hezbollah broke a post-civil-war vow not to turn its weapons against other Lebanese factions. At the time, Lebanon was mired in a political stalemate between a United States- and Saudi-backed government — which included Sunni, Christian and Druze parties — and Hezbollah and its allies.Hezbollah was infuriated by a government decision that outlawed its underground fiber-optic communication network, which was critical to its success during its 2006 war with Israel. Hezbollah’s leaders sent hundreds of fighters into largely Sunni neighborhoods of West Beirut. They overpowered Sunni militiamen and seized the offices and media outlets of political rivals, including Mr. Hariri.Hezbollah’s success so alarmed the Sunni Arab states that Saudi Arabia toyed with the idea of sending an Arab military force to intervene in Lebanon. Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister at the time, asked a visiting American diplomat whether the United States and NATO could provide equipment, logistics and “naval and air cover” to assist such an army, according to a classified American diplomatic cable disclosed by WikiLeaks. Prince Faisal warned Washington that Hezbollah’s actions would lead to an “Iranian takeover of all Lebanon.”Years later, Saudi leaders organized a similar force to wage their war in Yemen, against Houthi rebels allied with Iran. A day after Mr. Hariri’s resignation, the front page of a Saudi-owned pan-Arab newspaper declared, “Hariri departs Hezbollah’s republic.” The subtext was clear: Without its most prominent Sunni leader, Lebanon is under Hezbollah’s full control — and it will be fair game in the latest battle with Iran.', 'How to Defuse the Iraqi Kurdish Crisis - The New York TimesBAGHDAD — After more than 25 years of autonomy from the government in Baghdad, Iraq’s Kurdish region reached a watershed on Monday when it voted on independence. The final results are still being tabulated, but according to the Kurdish authorities, more than 90 percent of people voted for secession in the nonbinding referendum.Kurds are celebrating the result, which they see as an overdue reckoning and potentially a step toward their longstanding dreams of statehood, but few other parties are pleased. The question now is what will come next. Domestic and foreign opposition to the referendum threaten to escalate tensions, and pressure is mounting on the federal government in Baghdad to find a way to defuse the situation and prevent the breakup of Iraq.Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, has insisted that the referendum was not about setting the borders for a future Kurdish state or taking an immediate step toward independence. Instead, he said, it was a confirmation of the will of Iraqi Kurdish people to form their own state in the future.Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq is already taking a tough line. He has insisted that the referendum was unconstitutional and made clear that his government would take measures to prevent the breakup of the country. It’s an important objective. A united Iraq is crucial right now, as the war against the Islamic State continues. Kurdish secession moves will destabilize Iraq even further.Moreover, Mr. Abadi has good reason to be concerned about how the referendum was held. Voting took place not only in the autonomous Kurdish region, but also in what are termed the disputed areas — areas that are officially in federal Iraq but have come under the control of the Kurdish Regional Government and its pesh merga troops. The vote also took place in Kirkuk, a city whose status is still undecided according to the Iraqi Constitution. Baghdad rightly looks at this as an attempt by the Kurds to establish facts on the ground for a land grab for a future Kurdish state.The Iraqi federal government was hardly alone in opposing the referendum. The United States may be an ally of the Kurdish government, but Washington believed the independence vote shouldn’t have been held before the Islamic State is defeated. On Monday, the State Department said the United States was “deeply disappointed” with the Kurdish government. The United Nations likewise voiced concerns about the “potentially destabilizing effects” of the referendum.But the most vociferous critics have been Turkey and Iran, both of which have Kurdish secessionist movements that they fear could be encouraged by the vote. Turkey has said it may close its border with the Kurdish region, while Iran prevented flights into and out of the Kurdish region from using its airspace. Both countries have threatened military action if the Kurdish region secedes from Iraq, and to make the threat clear, both countries held military exercises near the border.Outside intervention isn’t the only potential trigger for escalation. Iraq’s Parliament has demanded that Mr. Abadi mobilize troops to secure Kirkuk and the disputed areas in response to the referendum. While he made clear that federal forces will not be used against the Kurdish region, he has asked the military to be “prepared to protect Kurdish citizens.” Several factions of the largely Shiite paramilitary groups known as the Popular Mobilization Forces are seeking to push back Kurdish control. They are now positioned close to the disputed areas and have vowed to prevent secession and to bring Kirkuk back under federal control — which could easily lead to fighting with the pesh merga.Mr. Abadi now has a tough job. He must keep Iraq whole and reassure Turkey and Iran enough that they do not intervene. At the same time, he should not punish the millions of Kurdish Iraqis who want to express their aspiration for self-determination. This is why moving forward, Mr. Abadi and the government in Baghdad must figure out how to differentiate between the actions of Kurdish politicians and the generations-long collective emotional wishes of the Kurdish people.If Baghdad works with its neighbors it can rebalance the relationship between the federal government and the Kurdish government and maintain peaceful control of the situation while leaving citizens in the Kurdish region unaffected. Control of oil exports through Turkey by the Kurdish government, long viewed as illegal by Baghdad, can be returned to the Iraqi government, as Turkey has hinted at. This would essentially freeze the finances of the regional government and force it to go back to Baghdad for funding.On Tuesday, the Iraqi cabinet ordered the Kurdish government to return control of Iraqi borders with Iran and Turkey, and airports by 6 p.m. Friday; if the Kurds refuse, the federal government says it will shut down Kurdish airspace. Turkey and Iran both appear eager to enforce that demand and Iraqi troops are already taking part in maneuvers on the Turkish side of the border.These measures will pressure the Kurdish leadership to agree to some of Baghdad’s terms, including the withdrawal of Kurdish forces to within official regional borders and returning to Baghdad oil fields seized starting in 2003.Such measures would satisfy pressure on the Iraqi federal government from its Arab and non-Kurdish communities to check Kurdish expansionism and also help pacify Turkish and Iranian worries about instability. But they will not answer the longer-term questions about Iraqi Kurdish aspirations for independence or the fate of Kirkuk.These questions will need to be answered through tough negotiations between Baghdad and the Kurdish government and the solutions carried out in a way that has a legal basis in Iraq’s Constitution. Before then, the partnership between Baghdad and Erbil, backed by the international coalition, which has led to the near complete defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq, should continue to be the focus for both sides.Other countries, in particular the United States, can also play a positive role. By supporting Baghdad’s efforts to prevent conflict and by encouraging the Kurdish government to be more flexible in its dealing with the federal government, the United States and others can bring the two sides together. This would avoid giving too great a role for Turkey and Iran, who are more concerned about their own interests than Iraq’s future. This may be the only way to reach a peaceful resolution to a tense situation in a region that is not short on violence.', "Former CIA analyst Dr. Sue Mi Terry provides insight on 'Fox & Friends' China’s announcement Saturday that it would halt exports of some petroleum products to North Korea and stop importing textiles from the rogue nation is just the latest evidence that President Trump’s campaign to put economic pressure on North Korea is beginning to pay dividends.As part of his efforts to get North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and missile programs, President Trump issued a new executive order Thursday that turns up the heat on what he called a “band of criminals” in Pyongyang.The executive order – issued just 48 hours after the president’s scathing denunciation of North Korea at the United Nations – imposes sanctions on any foreign financial institution that conducts or facilitates “any significant transaction in connection with trade with North Korea.”In addition, the order bars ships and planes that have stopped in North Korea from entering the U.S. for 180 days afterward.While the escalating war of insults thrown back and forth between President Trump and North Korean leaders is drawing international attention, the new executive order and other economic measures aimed at the North could have a greater impact. Now North Korea is about to feel the full force of U.S. economic pressure, which caused Iran to buckle. Kim Jong Un will face difficult choices as his cash flow begins to wither away. President Trump’s executive order is part of a robust campaign that is producing results. It gives all governments, companies, and individuals that want to trade with North Korea a clear choice: do business with either North Korea or the United States – but not both. Losing access to America’s $19 trillion market would be a stiff price to pay.Although the new executive order has not yet prompted North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to halt his provocations and escalating rhetoric, it puts more pressure on him to end to his nuclear and missile programs.China, which accounts for about 90 percent of North Korea’s foreign trade, is clearly getting the message of U.S. opposition to its economic support of the North.Before it announced its new trade restrictions with North Korea on Saturday, China supported two United Nations sanctions resolutions imposing trade restrictions against North Korea. In addition, China’s central bank issued a directive to the country’s banks to cease trade with North Koreans.China’s behavior bears close watching, since Beijing has a history of backsliding when the spotlight fades. In addition, it is not clear if the new banking directive covers financial activity conducted by Chinese individuals on behalf of North Korea.President Trump’s new executive order essentially tells China’s leadership that half measures are not enough. While Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the new executive order was not directed at China – a statement that is technically true – the order is certainly directed at precisely the kind of trade activities Beijing has persistently turned a blind eye to.The new U.S. policy is modeled on a provision in the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions and Divestment Act of 2010 that targeted business with Iran. Those sanctions put pressure on Iran to negotiate the controversial agreement that restricted its nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions.Kim Jong Un should be especially concerned because President Trump’s executive order is broader than the sanctions imposed on Iran seven years ago, which targeted only specific Iranian entities and certain aspects of Iranian trade.In contrast, President Trump’s new executive order authorizes the Treasury Department to cut off access to the U.S. financial system or freeze the assets of any banks that knowingly conduct significant transactions for sanctioned people or companies that trade with North Korea.Mistakenly, many Americans assume that comprehensive sanctions are already in place on North Korea. In fact, as of July, North Korea was only fourth on the list of countries with the most people subject to American sanctions – up from eighth place in early 2016.More importantly, massive loopholes in the sanctions on North Korea are now being closed. Until recently, sanctions on the North were lackluster because they rarely targeted the foreigners – mainly Chinese and Russian – who facilitate illicit trade.For example, until now, foreign banks – especially in China – could process transactions for sanctions evaders without much concern they would ever pay a price. Now that should change.President Trump’s new executive order enables the Treasury Department to target foreign banks that are not asking the right questions about their “customer’s customer.” These banks now must find out if the transaction for a company in China, Hong Kong or elsewhere really hides trade for North Korea or a designated North Korean entity under the surface.The new executive order is a warning shot before the Treasury Department unleashes significant penalties on banks that don’t ask more probing questions about their customers’ customers.Now North Korea is about to feel the full force of U.S. economic pressure, which caused Iran to buckle. Kim Jong Un will face difficult choices as his cash flow begins to wither away.We can only hope that this economic warfare convinces the North Korean regime to step back from threats to explode a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific or take other provocative action that could lead to a shooting war with the United States.

Follow him @_ARuggiero.", 'The Trump Doctrine - The New York TimesWell, it took almost a year, but we now have the “Trump Doctrine.” It’s very simple. And, as you’d expect, it fits neatly into a tweet. On nearly every major issue, President Trump’s position is: “Obama built it. I broke it. You fix it.”And that cuts right to the core of what is the most frightening thing about the Trump presidency. It’s not the president’s juvenile tweeting or all the aides who’ve been pushed out of his clown car at high speed or his industrial-strength lying.It’s Trump’s willingness to unravel so many longstanding policies and institutions at once — from Nafta to Obamacare to the global climate accord to the domestic clean power initiative to the Pacific trade deal to the Iran nuclear deal — without any real preparation either on the day before or for the morning after.Indeed, Trump has made most of his climate, health, energy and economic decisions without consulting any scientists, without inviting into the White House a broad range of experts, without putting forth his own clear-cut alternatives to the systems he’s unraveling, without having at the ready a team of aides or a political coalition able to implement any alternatives and without a strategic framework that connects all of his dots.In short, we’re simply supposed to take the president’s word that this or that deal “is the worst deal ever” — backed up by no serious argument or plan about how he will produce a better one.I’m open to improving any of these accords or institutions. I’m even open to the possibility that by just tipping over all these accords at once, and throwing away his steering wheel, Trump will get people to improve the Iran deal or Obamacare out of sheer panic at the chaos that might ensue if they don’t.But I am equally open to the possibility that unraveling all of these big systems at once — health, energy, geopolitics — without a clear plan or a capable team will set in motion chain reactions, some of them long term, that Trump has not thought through in the least. Moreover, when you break big systems, which, albeit imperfectly, have stabilized regions, environments or industries for decades, it can be very difficult to restore them.Question: We’re told by our secretary of state that he’s been engaged in some secret contacts with North Korea, exploring the possibility of a diplomatic solution that might dramatically reduce North Korea’s nuclear arsenal in return for U.S. promises of regime security. If, at the same time, Trump unilaterally pulls out of the deal we’ve already signed with Iran to prevent it from developing nukes — and Trump moves to reimpose sanctions — how does that not send only one message to the North Koreans: No deal with the U.S. is worth the paper it’s written on, so you’d be wise to hold on to all your nukes?Question: Iran controls tens of thousands of Shiite militiamen in Iraq and Syria who were our tacit allies in defeating ISIS. Tehran also has huge influence over Iraq’s government and over certain regions of Afghanistan as well. Can we stabilize Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan — post-ISIS — and keep our troop presence low and safe, without Iran’s help — and will that help be coming after Trump rips up the nuclear deal? If you think so, please raise your hand.And since our European allies as well as Russia and China have indicated that they will not follow us in backing out of the Iran deal or reimposing sanctions, Iran would have all the moral high ground and money it needs, and the U.S. would be isolated. Are we going to sanction E.U. banks if they deal with Iran?Trump came into office vowing to end the trade imbalance with China — a worthy goal. And what was his first move? To tear up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that would have put the U.S. at the helm of a 12-nation trading bloc built around U.S. interests and values, potentially eliminating some 18,000 tariffs on U.S. goods and controlling 40 percent of global G.D.P. And China was not in the group. That’s called leverage.Trump just ripped up the TPP to “satisfy the base” and is now left begging China for trade crumbs, with little leverage. And because he needs China’s help in dealing with North Korea, he has even less leverage on trade.Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord and, at the same time, restricted U.S. government funding for birth control both at home and abroad. Question: What is driving so many immigrants and refugees in Africa, the Middle East and Central America to try to get out of their world of disorder and into America and Europe and the world order?Answer: It is a cocktail of climate change, environmental degradation, population explosions and misgovernance in these countries. So Trump’s policy is to throw away every tool we have to mitigate climate change and population growth and try to build a wall instead, while also trying to bully Mexico’s unpopular president into trade concessions, which could help elect a radical populist in next year’s Mexican election — a successor who would be anti-American — and destabilize its economy as well.At a time when China has decided to go full-bore into clean tech and electric cars, at a time when all of the tech giants are building data centers that they want powered by clean energy, at a time when solar and wind power are growing increasingly competitive with fossil fuels (and America still has a technological lead in many of these areas), at a time when climate change may be stimulating bigger hurricanes and forest fires that are costing us hundreds of billions of dollars, Trump’s central energy initiative is to reverse Obama’s and bring back coal-fired power.None of these dots connect. And we will pay for that. “Whiplash” was a great movie. But it’s a terrible organizing principle for our foreign or domestic policy.', 'Our Stupid Gun Debate - The New York TimesBret Stephens: I know we’ll have to bring this conversation around to the Twitter feud between President Trump and Senator Bob Corker. But I don’t think we can begin with any subject other than Las Vegas. Everyone seems to want to understand the murderer’s state of mind. That strikes me as largely beside the point. What do you think?Gail Collins: Bret, you wrote an amazing column last week about repealing the Second Amendment, which would certainly do a lot more to stop mass shootings than psychoanalyzing the gunman. However, since that’s not going to happen, I do find it useful to at least try to figure out what creates this kind of person.Bret: No doubt we’ll find out more about Stephen Paddock’s state of mind as time goes by, but perhaps the most noteworthy point about him was his utter normality. Even his reported use of prostitutes and supposed remarks about being “born bad” are just, well, relatively ordinary bad male behavior. He was the “banality of evil” incarnate.Conservatives often say that the way to stop mass shootings isn’t by limiting access to weapons, but by doing more to make sure mentally ill people don’t get their hands on them. It’s a weak argument. For starters, even the most competent government agency would be hard-pressed to spot and stop deranged people — whose dark fantasies occur in the proverbial dark — before their rampages. And then you have these same conservatives block efforts to stop crazy people from purchasing guns on the grounds that they mustn’t have their Second Amendment rights removed without due process.Gail: Yeah, and these are the same people trying to squeeze mental health coverage out of the Affordable Care Act.I have an all-purpose theory for understanding American cultural polarization. We’re really two different countries — the crowded one and the empty one. It’s easy to understand why if you live in, say, rural Wyoming you are going to want to have some rifles. Also it’s obvious why in New York City we have thrived by making it stupendously difficult for anybody but the police to legally have weapons. But our current laws make it impossible for us crowdeds to keep guns completely out. That’s because the laws on gun sales reflect the financial needs of gun dealers and gun manufacturers. Bret: I’m no expert on gun manufacturers, though I can guess their financial motives. But the deeper problem is ideological. The N.R.A. is powerful not because it’s rich, but because it has successfully peddled the idea that our civil liberties rely principally on the possession of guns. What fantasy. Does anyone really think that when the agents of Leviathan show up at your doorstep to deport you to the gulag, your trusty Smith & Wesson will see you through?Gail: Don’t discount the economic end. The N.R.A. is totally about the gun industry, which has a problem in that everybody who wants to have a gun for anything except criminal activity already has one. Or more likely several — 3 percent of the population owns half the guns, and they’re the best sales target.So the only way for the makers and dealers to grow is by selling the idea that you need every new wrinkle. Like silencers or, God help us, bump stocks.Bret: Look, I would never want the government to stand in the way of any responsible adult with a legitimate reason to own a gun. I don’t just mean the hunter in Wyoming but also the protective father raising a family in a high-crime area or the woman who has to walk through a deserted area late at night.Gail: Those household guns are less likely to end up shooting an intruder than another member of the family. But go on.Bret: That’s a reason to own one gun, maybe even two, but not several dozen rifles kitted out to resemble fully automatic weapons. And I don’t think we can establish that kind of limiting principle while we have a Second Amendment.Don’t resign yourself to the idea that this will never change, Gail. A good argument is always worth making.Gail: The problem with your argument is that we’re agreeing too much.Let’s switch to a subject we can fight about. I know I can always drive you crazy by insulting Lindsey Graham. Last week he introduced a Senate bill to ban abortions at 20 weeks. We haven’t really discussed abortion much — do you think Senator Graham’s fighting the good fight or trying to impose his religious principles on the rest of the nation?Bret: I hate to break this to you, Gail, but I’m basically pro-choice. Always have been. I’m opposed to late-term abortions and think they should be severely restricted. I believe in religious liberty and don’t think, say, Catholic hospitals should be required to provide abortions.Otherwise, I subscribe to Bill Clinton’s line that abortion ought to be safe, legal and rare. It’s great that the abortion rate has this year dropped to its lowest rate since abortion became legal nationally in 1973. That’s thanks in large part to the vastly greater availability of contraception — another reminder that cultural conservatives often advocate positions that are at cross-purposes with their stated intentions.Gail: Everybody can rally around the idea that late-pregnancy abortions should be avoided whenever possible. Which means to me that people who try to ban them while also trying to defund Planned Parenthood and other programs that work to prevent unwanted pregnancies are hypocrites.Also people like Graham are interfering with painful decisions that are often made by couples who are eager to have a baby but discover late in the pregnancy that the fetus is terribly compromised and won’t survive if carried to term.Bret: That’s an awful situation for any parent. I guess my rejoinder is that a late-term abortion means certain death for the fetus; bringing the child to term means at least the hope of survival, however faint. Regarding Planned Parenthood, though, we agree again.Let’s switch the subject to the Corker-Trump feud. The president’s relationship with Senate Republicans reminds me a bit of Prince Charles’s marriage to Diana Spencer. We knew it was bad, but it took a while to figure out how bad. Corker’s disdain for the president isn’t revealing for what it says just about him, but probably about the Republican caucus as well.Gail: Well, Corker has made it pretty darn clear that almost everybody in the caucus is huddled under the stairs talking about what a nut case the president is. Which we sort of suspected. And that everyone’s afraid Trump will fire Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Given the fact that Tillerson seems incapable of appointing people to his department’s key jobs, if he goes I guess our allies will have to discuss North Korea with the janitorial staff.Corker’s a very important figure on foreign policy matters. I wonder how his rebellion will affect Trump’s attempt to get out of the Iran compact. What, by the way, do you think about the withdrawal idea? I think it’s crazy — we made the Iran deal along with our partners in the developed world, and none of them is going to resume the sanctions.Bret: Disagreement at last! I’ve been thinking about this topic a lot lately. I fought the Iran deal when it was being negotiated, and I think the Obama administration came away with a lousy agreement. Iran’s behavior is worse now, because it has been enriched and emboldened. Declarations that Iran is fulfilling its end of the bargain ignore serious concerns that it is cheating incrementally. At the end of the day Iran will emerge from the deal with an internationally recognized right to enrich unlimited quantities of uranium. We are setting ourselves up for another North Korean fiasco, which also began (under Clinton) with a supposedly negotiated solution.Gail: We have our argument!Bret: My problem is that I don’t trust the Trump team to execute a competent exit strategy from the agreement. For all the anti-Iranian rhetoric, Trump has done more than Obama to facilitate Iran’s grip over Syria, first by withdrawing support for U.S.-backed anti-Assad insurgents, then with a foolish cease-fire arrangement with the Russians. Decertification alone is a symbolic step that doesn’t break the agreement but merely hands responsibility to Congress to decide what to do next.As with anything and everything Trump, we’re being asked to take a ride with a drunken driver: we may need desperately to get to a destination, but there are no guarantees of getting there alive.Gail: Hey, that isn’t fair. We’ve got a disagreement going and then you finish up with a fresh attack on Donald Trump.Back to Iran. I think everyone agrees the Iranian deal is imperfect. Three arguments against ditching it.One is that Iran’s enemies overstate Iran’s unique … evildoerness. It’s true that they finance terrorism in their neighborhood. So do many of the richest and most powerful people in Saudi Arabia. ISIS isn’t an Iranian production.Second, the only way for us to survive over the long run in this incredibly dangerous world is by working together with other nations that hold the same basic values we do. If we drop out of this international agreement, we turn our backs on our allies and we undermine the spirit of cooperation that all of our recent presidents have worked so hard to cultivate.Third, it won’t do any good. Allies will continue to do business with Iran, whatever power the bargain has over Iranian nuclear development is weakened.Three strikes and you’re out.Bret: Now we’re talking! Disagreement down the line.Iran is in a class by itself in the awfulness department. It openly vows to annihilate another U.N. member state. It provides financial and military support to terrorist groups both Shiite (Hezbollah) and Sunni (Hamas). It campaigns against ISIS but gave shelter to Al Qaeda. It continues to arm Shiite killing squads in Iraq. It is Bashar al-Assad’s best friend in his genocidal campaign against his own people. It has the death of hundreds of American soldiers in Lebanon and Iraq on its hands. It has conducted terror attacks as far away as Argentina and tried to blow up a restaurant in Washington in order to assassinate the Saudi ambassador. It denies the existence of gay people within its borders and then hangs them when it finds them. It holds Holocaust denial conferences and cartoon competitions.I don’t think it is out of the question that we can get our allies to be tougher on the enforcement front, even if we don’t renegotiate the deal itself (which would require Iranian consent). We still have the whip hand, since we can make companies like the French energy giant Total or the German engineering firm Siemens choose between doing business in the United States or in Iran.I agree that we need to be mindful of our alliances, but this agreement was never ratified by the Senate and doesn’t have the status of a treaty. And, ultimately, we are better off in a world in which Iran doesn’t have a bomb and the European diplomatic corps hates us than one in which the reverse is true.Told you I was conservative!', '', 'DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – The U.S. military says it has halted some military exercises with Gulf countries over the ongoing diplomatic crisis targeting Qatar.Here\'s a look at the ongoing dispute, the worst to grip the region since Iraq\'s 1990 invasion of Kuwait.___A COUNTRY TARGETEDQatar is a nation about the size of the U.S. state of Connecticut, which juts out like a thumb on the Arabian Peninsula into the Persian Gulf. It has the highest per-capita income in the world due to its natural gas reserves, the third-largest on the planet after Russia and Iran. Just over 10 percent of its 2.2 million people are Qataris, with the rest foreign workers. Its people follow an ultraconservative form of Islam known as Wahhabism, though unlike neighboring Saudi Arabia, women can drive and foreigners can drink alcohol. Qatar will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.___A WIDENING GULFBahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates cut ties to Qatar on June 5. They also launched an economic boycott, stopping Qatar Airways flights from using their airspace, closing off the small country\'s sole land border with Saudi Arabia and blocking its ships from using their ports. They say the crisis stems from Qatar\'s support for extremist groups in the region, charges denied by Doha. The four nations have also pointed to Qatar\'s close relationship with Iran, with which it shares a massive offshore gas field that provides the peninsular nation its wealth. Qatar restored full diplomatic ties to Iran amid the dispute.___A LIST OF DEMANDSThe Associated Press obtained a list of the Arab countries\' demands of Qatar on June 22. They include limiting diplomatic ties to Iran, shutting down the state-funded Al-Jazeera satellite news network and other media outlets, and severing ties to all "terrorist organizations," including the Muslim Brotherhood and Lebanon\'s Hezbollah. It also demanded Qatar expel the Turkish troops now stationed in the country, as well as pay reparations and submit to auditing. Qatar rejected the demands as violations of its sovereignty, letting the deadline and an extension pass.___A DIPLOMATIC DANCEKuwait has sought to mediate the crisis, sending its 88-year-old emir shuttling between the countries involved. The countries have meanwhile sent emissaries abroad to brief foreign leaders and speak to journalists, as well as spend millions on Washington influence firms and advertising. The U.S., which has some 10,000 troops stationed at Qatar\'s sprawling al-Udeid Air Base as part of its campaign against the Islamic State group and the war in Afghanistan, also has sought to end the crisis. However, U.S. President Donald Trump has made comments seemingly supporting the Arab nations\' efforts at isolating Qatar, complicating those efforts. A Trump-sparked call Sept. 9 between Qatar\'s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that offered a chance at negotiations also broke down in mutual recriminations.___AN UNCERTAIN FUTUREIt\'s unclear what, if anything, will resolve the crisis. The Arab nations could launch financial sanctions, though Qatari investments around the world include Harrods department store in London, Volkswagen in Germany and the company owning New York\'s Empire State Building. They could attempt to block Qatari shipments of liquefied natural gas, though that could spark hostilities. Qatar has yet to retaliate, but could shut down an undersea natural gas pipeline running to the United Arab Emirates, a crucial power source for a desert nation that relies on desalination plants for water and air conditioners to cope with the scorching heat. Meanwhile, both Qatar and the boycotting Arab nations continue to needle each other through local media. One Qatari exile has suggested a "bloodless coup" replace Doha\'s leadership while Saudi Arabia has promoted a little-known Qatari ruling family member.___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at https://twitter.com/jongambrellAP.

LOUIS — In 1977, when I was 2 years old, my family and I moved from Iran to America so that my father could pursue his doctorate in chemistry at Michigan State University. Two years later, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini seized power and Iran was no longer the country my family knew. We stayed in the United States, becoming permanent residents and eventually citizens by 1999. My parents were raised Muslim but they stopped practicing after leaving Iran, so our household was secular.In many ways, my family was the picture of assimilation. We lived in Edwardsville, Ill., and my father taught chemistry at the local university. My mother opened a tailoring shop. I played tennis, joined a fraternity at the University of Illinois and married my wife in a Catholic church. My sister was in the National Honor Society, and my brother was on the high school football team and played bass in punk bands. Today, he is a corporate chef who hires and supervises hundreds of American workers, and she is a local prosecutor specializing in crimes against children.None of these accomplishments, however, have shielded us from the indiscriminate damage of President Trump’s travel ban, which my mother is challenging as a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and partner organizations.In December 2016, my family received the devastating news that my father’s liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer that was first diagnosed in 2014, had returned. His prognosis was terminal. We needed family more than ever during that time. Fortunately, my aunt who lives in Iran had plans to travel here for my sister’s wedding, so she offered to stay for a month or so to support my mother. (They are sisters, and my aunt knows best how to help my mom.) But on Jan. 27, President Trump issued an executive order that revoked visas from Iranians, as well as from citizens of six other Muslim-majority countries.To this day, my aunt has not been able to get her visa, even though she has passed background checks twice. After courts stopped the first two versions of Mr. Trump’s ban, he issued  a third on Sept. 24. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court dismissed the last remaining appeal in a pair of cases opposing the second ban, and lawyers are challenging the third version, which is even worse. If implemented, all of our relatives will be permanently barred from visiting us here. I was just with my father in the hospital, and such naked bias, from a country he loves and has raised his family in, deeply hurts him.As a former federal counterterrorism prosecutor, I know the importance of protecting America’s national security. For nearly a decade, mostly during the George W. Bush administration, I worked at the Department of Homeland Security to identify and neutralize threats to America. I flew across the country, litigating immigration cases against people accused of terrorism, terrorism fund-raising and espionage. When I appeared in court, I often used my full name, Javad Mohammed Khazaeli. I wanted everyone to know that terrorist extremists did not speak for me nor for a vast majority of Muslims.I worked shoulder-to-shoulder with special agents, analysts and other prosecutors using targeted, data-based enforcement. We tore apart files looking for information that we could use to make our cases. Because of this, we were very effective. In contrast, President Trump’s Muslim ban ignores data and facts, relying instead on Islamophobia. I know his ban won’t make our country safer. According to the Cato Institute, from 1975 to 2016, not a single American has been killed on United States soil by terrorists from any of the countries singled out for the third ban.In the days after the Sept. 11 attacks, anti-Muslim discrimination was real. My brother was harassed at a record shop because he looked Middle Eastern. I was enraged that the acts of a small number of violent extremists would be imputed to my family. But President Bush went to great lengths to differentiate between “a radical network of terrorists” and the rest of the Muslim world. “The terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself,” he said in a speech on Sept. 20, 2001. “The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends.”By contrast, today we have a president who has fanned the flames of anti-Muslim discrimination. “Islam hates us,” he said in an interview with CNN. So perhaps it is no surprise that six months ago, for the first time in the more than 30 years that my mother has owned her business, she was accosted by a customer demanding to know her religion.While the administration relentlessly pursues this senseless ban, my family and I will continue to hold our heads high and fight for the values we know to be true of the United States — freedom of religion, protection against discrimination, and the belief that people should be judged by their characters and deeds, rather than by the countries they come from.', 'James Rosen reports on the online political feud.President Trump on Sunday ripped increasingly vocal critic Sen. Bob Corker, saying the Tennessee Republican gutlessly dropped his re-election bid after begging for the Trump endorsement he never received.“Corker ‘begged’ me to endorse him,” Trump said in a string of tweets. "I said ‘NO’ and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement). He also wanted to be secretary of state, I said ‘NO THANKS.’ ... Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn\'t have the guts to run!”It\'s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.Corker fired back minutes later, by tweeting: “It\'s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center.

We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!”Senator Bob Corker "begged" me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said "NO" and he dropped out (said he could not win without...Trump’s attack followed Corker saying last week, amid reports that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will resign, that Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis, and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly “are those people that help separate our country from chaos.”..my endorsement).

He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!Corker Chief of Staff Todd Womack on Sunday disputed Trump\'s portrayal of the endorsement issue.“The president called Senator Corkeron Monday afternoonand asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times,” Womack told Fox News....Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn\'t have the guts to run!Trump and Corker appeared to have a good relationship early in Trump’s roughly first eight months in the White House, even playing golf together in June with retired NFL quarterback Peyton Manning.However, that relationship appears to have fractured, at least publicly, in August, when Corker criticized Trump’s handling of the violent Charlottesville protests, in which an alleged white supremacist fatally struck a woman with a car.Corker said Trump has yet to demonstrate “the stability nor some of the competence” needed to be successful.Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that\'s about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!Trump on Sunday, in a separate tweet, argued Corker supported the Iran nuclear deal brokered by the previous Obama administration that Trump argues Iran is violating.“He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!” Trump tweeted.Fox News\' Jason Donner contributed to this report.', 'BRUSSELS – Brexit is Europe\'s big worry but isn\'t the only global problem that the leaders of 28 EU nations are trying to resolve at their latest summit.Here\'s a look at what the leaders are grappling with at meetings that resume Friday:BREXIT BURNOUTBritish Prime Minister Theresa May came to Brussels on Thursday trying to reinvigorate divorce talks with the EU that are bogging down. Her EU partners said she\'s made progress, but want more "meat" — notably about the exit bill, or how much Britain will pay for its previous EU commitments. Other leaders also appeared to resist May\'s push for speedier talks on post-Brexit trade. The refrain among EU leaders: "unity" in the face of a fractured Britain.___SPAIN\'S SEPARATISTSAll eyes were on Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on the summit\'s first day, as his government moved to take away autonomy from Catalonia while it threatens to break away. But the EU firmly refused to intervene in the standoff. While Rajoy won unconditional support from France\'s president, other countries stayed largely mum — perhaps hoping the Catalonian separatist spirit doesn\'t spread to other independence-minded regions.___TAXING INTERNET GIANTSFrance\'s President Emmanuel Macron made progress on his push to make companies like Amazon pay taxes where they make profits, and not in tax havens. The 39-year-old president wants Europe to embrace startups and be a bigger player in the digital economy but says it won\'t work without a "level playing field" when it comes to taxes. The EU leaders asked for proposals on a new Europe-wide tax policy by early next year.___COUNTERING TRUMP ON IRANThe EU leaders came to unusually easy unanimity on the Iran nuclear agreement: They embraced it, even as President Donald Trump denounces it. That\'s in part because the deal allows for renewed trade with Iran — a longtime European trading partner — in exchange for curbs on Iranian nuclear activities. But the EU is also afraid of growing global tensions, and argues that abandoning the deal now could torpedo any effort to negotiate with North Korea over its nuclear ambitions.', 'U.S. Warning to Pakistan: Stop Backing Terrorism - The New York TimesISLAMABAD — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson stopped in Islamabad on his way to New Delhi on Tuesday to deliver what he hoped would be a sobering message to Pakistan: Stop funding or providing shelter to terrorist groups. Now.It is a message the United States has been giving the Pakistanis in various forms since the Sept. 11 attacks, and it is one the Pakistanis have by turns harkened to, bristled at and shrugged off — sometimes in the same meeting — for years.In tackling the deeply dysfunctional relationship between the United States and Pakistan, the Trump administration is finding that it is not unlike some difficult marriages: all but impossible to fix, but also impossible to end.There were few signs on Tuesday that this 16-year-old dynamic had changed.Mr. Tillerson met with three of Pakistan’s top leaders at the elegant prime minister’s residence in Islamabad: Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi; the foreign minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif; and, most important, the Army’s chief of staff, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa.At a formal greeting before a portrait of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who is considered the father of Pakistan, Mr. Tillerson began with reassurances. “Pakistan is important, as you know, regionally to the U.S. security relationships and so important regionally to our joint goals of providing peace and security to the region and providing opportunity for a greater economic relationship as well,” he said.Mr. Abbasi, wearing a traditional white kurta next to Mr. Tillerson’s dark suit, responded cheerfully but pointedly. “The U.S. can rest assured that we are strategic partners in the war against terror and that today Pakistan is fighting the largest war in the world against terror,” he said.The United States believes that Pakistan has for years supported terrorist groups, like the Haqqani network, that attack American troops in Afghanistan, undermining the 16-year effort to defeat the Taliban. But for just as long, the United States has relied on Pakistani air and land routes to supply both American and Afghan forces.Without Pakistan, the United States would not be able to keep troops in Afghanistan — but it also might not need to, some American observers suggest.“What do you do when your allies are part of the problem?” asked Daniel L. Byman, a counterterrorism expert at Georgetown University. “The desire to turn our backs on these people is there, but then you worry that terrorists will have more operational freedom and it will cost you more in the long run.”In public, the Pakistanis say they have killed more terrorists at greater cost in lives lost than any other nation. In private, they say they must hedge their bets against the inevitable day when American troops leave Afghanistan.In the days leading up to Mr. Tillerson’s visit, the United States conducted a flurry of airstrikes along the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan, fulfilling President Trump’s promise in August to intensify attacks against the Taliban and Haqqani network, which has run a virtual factory in Pakistan since 2005 to supply suicide bombers in Afghanistan.Local news media outlets reported more than a dozen missile strikes that killed scores of Haqqani fighters. The strikes, many of them in Pakistani territory, are deeply irritating to Pakistan, which considers them a threat to its sovereignty.Along with the attacks, the Trump administration has toughened its rhetoric. In a speech last week that offered effusive praise for India, Mr. Tillerson warned, “We expect Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorist groups based there that threaten its own people and the broader region.”Senior Pakistani army and intelligence officials expressed confidence in background interviews in recent days that the Trump administration cannot sustain a hostile stance for too long. The Pakistanis are keenly aware that the United States relies on them not only for supplies of material, but also for intelligence.The Obama administration worked to reduce its reliance on Pakistan in part by reaching a reconciliation with Iran, the only other viable option for supplying troops in Afghanistan. India is building a port in the Iranian city of Chabahar, where supplies could be landed and shipped to Afghanistan.C. Christine Fair, an associate professor at Georgetown University, argues that Pakistan represents a far greater threat to American interests than Iran does. It was Pakistan that provided nuclear technology to North Korea and Libya, and Pakistan’s proxies have killed more American troops than Iran’s, she said.But the Trump administration’s hostility toward Iran — Mr. Trump has threatened to tear up the Iran nuclear accord — has closed off such a strategy, so the United States must rely on Pakistan.“It’s like a woman trying to leave an abusive marriage when she has no money,” Ms. Fair said. “How do you do that?”Will tougher rhetoric change Pakistani behavior? Experts are skeptical.“Getting tough on Pakistan, which we’ve tried before, never works,” said Ryan C. Crocker, a former ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. “In fact, it has the opposite effect. They just dig in deeper.”', '                                    Dec. 4: Foreign Ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) attend a meeting in Bayan Palace, in Kuwait City                                                                            (Reuters)                                                                    KUWAIT CITY – The United Arab Emirates on Tuesday announced it has formed a new economic and partnership group with Saudi Arabia, separate from the Gulf Cooperation Council -- a move that could undermine the council amid a diplomatic crisis with member state Qatar.The Emirati Foreign Ministry announcement, just hours ahead of a GCC meeting in Kuwait, said the new "joint cooperation committee" was approved by the UAE\'s ruler and president, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nayhan.Saudi Arabia did not immediately report on the new partnership.It wasn\'t immediately clear how the development could affect the six-member GCC meeting, which is expected to focus on the Qatar issue. Half of the GCC members are boycotting Doha in a dispute that\'s cleaved the Arabian Peninsula.The Emirati ministry said the new "committee is assigned to cooperate and coordinate between the UAE and Saudi Arabia in all military, political, economic, trade and cultural fields, as well as others, in the interest of the two countries."The UAE and Saudi Arabia have cultivated even-closer ties in recent years. Emirati troops are deeply involved in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Abu Dhabi\'s powerful crown prince, Mohammad bin Zayed Al Nayhan, also is believed to have a closer relationship with Saudi Arabia\'s young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The Emirati announcement did not say whether any other Gulf Arab countries would be invited to join the new group but the development puts pressure the GCC, a group of American-allied Gulf Arab nations formed in part in 1981 as a counterbalance to Shiite power Iran.The United States and its European allies all have told the council\'s members that the region remains stronger with them working together as a whole, while the countries themselves still appear divided over their future.The fact the GCC meeting in Kuwait was to take place at all is a bit of a surprise, given the unusually sharp criticism among the typically clubby members of the GCC pointed at Doha."This is the most important annual summit the GCC has held for more than two decades," said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a research fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. "The GCC needs to illustrate its relevance after having been bypassed at every stage of the Qatar crisis."The dispute began in June, following what Qatar described as a hack of its state-run news agency that saw incendiary comments attributed to its ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Soon after, GCC members Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates closed off their airspace and seaports to Qatar, as well as the small peninsular nation\'s sole land border with Saudi Arabia.The boycott initially reeled Doha, though it soon replaced food products with those flown in from Turkey and Iran.However, Qatar\'s foreign reserves have dropped by some $10 billion -- a fifth of their value -- since the dispute began. Those reserves are crucial in supporting the nation\'s riyal, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, as well as funding the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup that Doha will host.For boycotting nations, they allege Qatar funds extremist groups and has too-cozy ties to Iran. Qatar has long denied funding extremists but it restored full diplomatic ties with Iran during the crisis. Doha shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Tehran that gives its citizens the highest per-capita income in the world.A similar dispute involving Qatar erupted in 2014. But this time positions have hardened against Qatar, whose support for Islamist opposition groups has angered the Arab nations now boycotting it. The UAE in particular views Islamists as a threat to hereditary rule in its federation of seven sheikhdoms. Egypt, angered by Qatar\'s support for the Muslim Brotherhood and the nation\'s deposed President Mohammed Morsi, is also boycotting Doha.The U.S., which has some 10,000 troops stationed at Qatar\'s sprawling al-Udeid Air Base as part of its campaign against the Islamic State group and the war in Afghanistan, also has sought to end the crisis. Its military has halted some regional exercises to put pressure on the GCC to resolve the crisis. However, President Donald Trump in the meantime made comments seemingly supporting the Arab nations\' efforts at isolating Qatar, complicating those efforts.A Trump-prompted call in September between Qatar\'s Sheikh Tamim and the Saudi crown prince that offered a chance at negotiations also broke down in mutual recriminations.Kuwait\'s 88-year-old emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, has tried to mediate the dispute, so far without success. However, Kuwait appeared in recent days to secure promises from the GCC to attend its annual high-level summit.It remains in question who will attend from each member state. Bahrain had sworn it would not attend any meeting that featured Qatar, though a lower-level official attended a meeting of GCC foreign ministers on Monday in Kuwait City. Qatar\'s Shiekh Tamim already committed to attending, while Oman said another official would represent Sultan Qaboos bin Said.But the GCC meeting also represents more than just the Qatar crisis. The long-stalemated Saudi-led war in Yemen suffered a new setback with the death Monday of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who recently defected from the Shiite rebels holding its capital.Meanwhile, a new generation of Gulf leaders is rising, like Saudi Arabia\'s assertive 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed, who launched the Yemen war and has been more confrontational with Iran."The Saudi camp is seeking to commit the Gulf states to a hard-line anti-Iran policy and adherence to Saudi leadership," Ayham Kamel, the head of the Middle East and North Africa division of the Eurasia Group, wrote in an analysis published Tuesday. "While the UAE believes its interests are best served by an alliance with Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain is compelled to follow Riyadh\'s lead, the other Gulf states are much more hesitant to do so."', '', '', 'He’s in the U.S.; She’s in Iran: Couples Cope With the Travel Ban - Video - NYTimes.com', '', 'Mogadishu, Iran, North Korea: Your Monday Briefing - The New York TimesGood morning.

Already, the island nation of Bahrain has said it won\'t take part in any meeting that Qatar attends.Qatar\'s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani would fly to Kuwait City for the two-day meeting scheduled to begin Tuesday. It quoted Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani as confirming the emir\'s attendance and saying he hoped "all parties involved do not need a Western party to intervene."GCC members Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have cut off Doha over allegations that Qatar supports extremists and has too-friendly relations with Iran. Qatar long has denied supporting extremists, while it shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Iran.It\'s unclear which countries, if any of those boycotting Doha, will attend.Kuwait has been trying to mediate an end to the crisis that began in June. Its ruler, the 88-year-old Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, has flown between Gulf capitals carrying messages.

If they are not held accountable, they become further emboldened. And for the victims, it is a little closure and justice.”Ultimately, the powerhouse lawyer digs deep to find as many legal loopholes as possible.Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, an Israeli lawyer, has successfully sued scores of terrorist groups and state sponsors of terror.             “We try to focus on entities and individuals and rogue regimes that provide it material support and resources. Even then it is very hard to nail down. ISIS moves funds through Islamic ‘Halawa’ money transfers. These are informal networks of money changers who will move sums internationally between branches in neighborhoods of Islamic countries, for a small percentage,” Darshan-Leitner explained. “This dark banking system, which is not plugged into the official international banking system can move funds around virtually undetected. It is a relentless struggle, but we are confident that if we continue to pursue groups like ISIS we can learn a lot about their finances and partners.”While going precisely after ISIS is a near-impossible feat given the covert nature of its operatives in Iraq, Syria and scattered through western countries, Leitner instead goes after the individuals and businesses who —directly or indirectly —fund them from banks to oil exporters to charities and most recently, social media conglomerates.As such, the firm’s focus has been to go after those individuals and businesses located in Western states that “aid and abet” the black-clad jihadist army in violation of international antiterrorism laws, which includes social media platforms.“YouTube provides ISIS with the ability to post its videos and disseminate its messages, and Twitter provides the terror group services,” Darshan-Leitner contended. “Western law enforcement agencies have already determined that several of the deadly ISIS attacks in Europe were perpetuated by terrorists who organized via their social media accounts. Where would ISIS be today if they weren’t able to post beheading videos and recruitment propaganda? How would teens know how to contact them or travel to Syria to join them?”Darshan-Leitner has to-date filed suits against Facebook, Google —the owner of YouTube —and Twitter on behalf of ISIS and Hamas victims. The cases, initially filed in New York courts, largely have been moved to California at the request of the mostly Palo Alto-based enterprises.“The social media companies are liable as they violated U.S. law in providing material support and resources,” she said. “Clearly, these companies with their sophisticated technology and logarithms which allow them to know everything about their users’ likes and dislikes, have the capabilities to identify and block the terror groups and block the calls to violence.”AS NORTH KOREA THREATENS ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE ATTACK, QUESTIONS OVER LAPSES IN U.S. GRID SECURITY RISEAnd when it comes to suing governments, Darshan-Leitner has had scores of judgments against the regimes of Iran and Syria for “their involvement in international terrorism and support of groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas” in legal standing of Americans killed or wounded in the Middle East.“Iran and Syria continue to be the largest state sponsors of international terrorism. They provide the finances, training, weapons, safe houses and ideology,” she claimed. “We are very persistent in continuing to file suits against them and we try to locate Iranian and Syrian assets that we can try to seize to enforce our judgments. It is a war of attrition, and we will continue to pursue these outlaw regimes on behalf of the terror victims and their families.”On that note, Darshan-Leitner is now deep in a $67 million judgment against U.S.-based Boeing, representing the American Leibovitch family —who lost their seven-year-old child to a 2003 Iran-connected terror attack —over the flight giant’s contentious deal with Tehran. Following the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action —commonly called the “Iran Deal” —the previously pariah nation entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase some $20 billion in aircraft.IRANIAN EX-PATS RALLY WHILE ROUHANI RAILSDarshan-Leitner wants all the information on how and where the money is going to be exposed, but Boeing has asserted that disclosing the details of the transaction would be an obstruction of a U.S. foreign policy and has fought resolutely to keep the details secret.Darshan-Leitner is pushing for the Trump administration to agree that Boeing should disclose details regarding its multi-billion dollar deal selling aircraft to the Iranian regime.(REUTERS/Matt Mills)Earlier this month, a Chicago federal court ordered the Trump administration to file a statement by October 12 notifying the court if the government concurs that unveiling the details of the Boeing deal will interfere with Iranian-U.S. foreign policy. Boeing declined to comment further on the matter.Given that Iran and Syria are the only official state sponsors of terror listed in the United States, along with Sudan, suits against them can be filed in American courts. But with other regimes such as North Korea, the process is more complicated and must be filed outside the U.S given that the hermit country was quietly removed from the list in 2008, granting them sovereign immunity and thus they cannot be sued by U.S citizens.ISIS STILL STEALING, SPILLING AND SMUGGLING OIL THROUGHOUT IRAQPrior to that, Darshan-Leitner successfully represented American citizens in three historic multimillion dollar verdicts against the regime in Pyongyang. She won a monumental $30 million judgment on behalf of the family of Kim Dong-shik, a U.S. resident and Christian missionary kidnapped in 2000 and murdered in North Korea by the regime. In 2006, she won a case for Hezbollah rocket attack victims after a U.S. federal court determined that North Korea was liable for providing support to Hezbollah, along with a case in a San Juan Puerto Rico court involving the 1972 Lod Airport attack in which a court ruled North Korea trained and funded terrorists.“We continue to look for elusive North Korean assets. They conduct little trade and commerce and so going after their assets in order to enforce our judgments is difficult, so we are trying to be very diligent in our efforts to locate those who are illegally trading with North Korea or providing it an type of services or goods that can be seized,” the attorney continued, adding that North Korea ought to be placed once again as a state sponsor of terror so that other victims’ families, such as Otto Warmbier’s parents, can target them directly.Darshan-Leitner, who was born and raised in Israel in a time when one could not even “walk the streets” for fear of an attack, said that she could not “sit idly” and sees it as her lifelong mission to bring terrorists and their backers to justice.“We see our efforts, utilizing lawsuits and court systems to counter the terrorists as an important part of the effort to obstruct. Western governments are shackled by treaties, domestic restraints and political correctness and have trouble doing what needs to be done to target and destroy terror groups,” she added. “We are private attorneys representing private terror victims. Once a group like ISIS crosses the line of all civilized behavior, they have to be battled until they are destroyed. Or they will return and come back at us.”Hollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

The biology major decided to accept a full scholarship to play for the university this spring, in the wake of the controversy.Issues arose when Derakhshani wore a simple headband during a February competition in Gibraltar. She was competing under the oversight of the Iranian Chess Federation, an affiliation that allowed her to enter several championship-cycle tournaments. Iranian law requires women to wear head scarves in public, but she didn\'t think it would be a problem."I don\'t know why some people have enough free time to worry about what I wear," Derakhshani said.She was 18 when she moved to Barcelona, Spain, and recruited by a chess club. She declined to be on Iran\'s national team sponsored by the government because she didn\'t want to be controlled by the rules of the team, including wearing a head scarf even while outside Iran.But days after the Gibraltar tournament, the head of the Iranian Chess Federation said Derakhshani and her 14-year-old brother could no longer play in the country or under Iran\'s name. He cited Derakhshani\'s refusal to wear a head scarf and said her brother had played against an Israeli player. Iran doesn\'t recognize Israel and has a policy of not competing against Israeli athletes.Derakhshani said her brother was paired by a computer and didn\'t know the player\'s nationality before the match."It was just cruel," she said.

Joining us live here in Washington, White House national security advisor, General H.R. McMaster. General, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: Thanks, James. It\'s a pleasure to be here. ROSEN: It\'s an honor to have you. The president called this new strategy towards Iran a two-step process. Step one is withholding the certification as you\'ve done with an eye toward potentially securing some changes to the Iran nuclear deal and some changes in Iran’s behavior outside of the deal. Step two, as the president made clear in the remarks we are about to hear, is that if the first step doesn\'t work, we cancel the deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and their allies, then the agreement will be terminated. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: So, while we’re in this first phase seeking changes to the nuclear deal, is that the policy of United States government that we continue to implement fully all existing U.S. obligations under the deal? MCMASTER: Yes, it is. And what the president, though, has done is he has set out a marker, a marker to Iranians and to our allies and partners that we have to fix fundamental flaws in this deal. It\'s a weak deal that is being weakly monitored. And so, the president has made clear that he will not permit this deal to provide cover for what we know is a horrible regime to develop a nuclear weapon. ROSEN: So, two of the men in government today whom I think you most admire and respect advise the president against making this decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEN. JOSEPH DUNFORD, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STATE: Iran is not a material breach of the agreement and I do believe the agreement to date has delayed development of a nuclear capability by Iran. JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY: I believe at this point in time, absent indications to the contrary, it is something the president should consider staying with. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: And our allies have weighed in, right about where you would have expected them to be, with Britain, France and Germany issuing a joint statement and I quote: We stand committed to the JCPOA -- that\'s the technical name of the Iran deal -- and its full implementation by all sides. Preserving the JCPOA is in our shared national security interest, unquote.So, General, isn\'t it farcical to imagine that the Iranians or the P5-plus-1 allies are going to be willing to revisit the terms of this deal? MCMASTER: No, they already are revisiting the terms of the deal and implementation of the deal. And our European allies, the E3 they’re called -- France, Germany and the U.K. -- are supporting much more rigorous enforcement of the JCPOA and monitoring. One of the real problems with this deal is we can\'t really say with confidence that they are complying and we know from their behavior, their behavior broadly in the region, and their behavior within the agreement where they have walked up to the line, they have crossed the line several times in terms of the restrictions, that this is not a trustworthy regime. So, much more comprehensive monitoring is in order. ROSEN: What parts do you see the Iranians being willing to revisit? MCMASTER: Well, it\'s not even revisit. It\'s just implement the agreement by going to sites, to fully implement the inspections of sites, the monitoring of suspicious sites within Iran. ROSEN: The things you find most objectionable about the deal, which is the restrictions on military sites for access for inspectors, the sunset causes, the Iranians are not going to revisit any of that, are they? Willingly. MCMASTER: Well, they have to revisit it because otherwise what you do is you just give the Iranians the opportunity to develop the nuclear capability. Their programs can advance and then they can go to industrial scale enrichment of uranium within a very short period of time and then bridge into a weapon, and that is just an unacceptable risk in the world. ROSEN: Isn\'t that precisely what they can do if you walk away from the deal? MCMASTER: Well, the president is not walking away from the deal yet. So, if he sees some real change, if he sees the ability of the Congress within U.S. law to address some of these problems associated with the deal. So, this -- in our legislation, the domestic law about the deal was really flawed because it was really just about cost reporting to each other. So, what the president has done is met with Congress to ask Congress help fix this domestic legislation and let\'s work on as Secretary Tillerson has said, a deal that can lay alongside the JCPOA and address its fundamental flaws. One of which you already mentioned, which is the sunset clause where Iran can just wait for a little while and reap all the benefits of sanctions relief to enrich the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is on a murderous brutal campaign across the Middle East. (CROSSTALK)MCMASTER: And then they’re going to breach in to a nuclear weapon. Yes.ROSEN: Which is designated as part of this initiative, correct? MCMASTER: Because I think what’s really important about the president’s speech is to pay attention to the whole speech because what the president has done is he has laid out a strategy for dealing with Iran\'s destabilizing and dangerous hate filled behavior, its behavior toward its own people and its behavior towards the region. And I would ask, as we always pay attention to our European allies and others, pay attention to our allies and partners in the region. What they said, the people who were under the gun of this regime, Israel and Saudi Arabia in particular. ROSEN: All right. Let\'s turn to a country that many believe Iran has actually been helping advance towards a nuclear weapons capability and that\'s North Korea. The Stalinist regime in Pyongyang this past week reissued its threat to move militarily against Guam, a U.S. territory. We have heard you and the president and others in the administration reaffirm many times that the so-called military option remains on the table. What would you like our adversary, in this instance Kim Jong-un, to know about that military option? Is it the same option military that was on the table when I used to hear Condoleezza Rice talk about it in 2005, or has in fact the North Koreans nuclear progress in that time served to constrain the military options that we have today? MCMASTER: Our president has been really clear about this. He is not going to permit this rogue regime, Kim Jong-un, to threaten the United States with a nuclear weapon. And so, he is willing (ph) to do anything necessary to prevent that from happening and what Kim Jong-un should recognize is that if he thinks the development of this nuclear capability is keeping him safer, it\'s actually the opposite. It’s having the opposite effect.ROSEN: What about the military options, are they the same ones we had in 2005? MCMASTER: Well, they were under constant refinement. So, we have a broad range of new capabilities coming into our armed forces, thanks to the president\'s focus on modernizing the armed forces, addressing what had been a bow wave of deferred military modernization. So, our military is getting stronger and stronger under military leaders are refining, improving plans every day. Plans we hope we don\'t have to use but we must be ready, we have to be ready. And so, all of our armed forces are getting to really a high, high degree of readiness for this mission, if it\'s necessary. ROSEN: This tweet by President Trump instantly became one of his most memorable. It was posted just after 11:00 p.m. on the night of September 23rd and it read and I quote: Just heard foreign minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If the echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won\'t be around much longer.General, did you receive advance warning that that tweet was going to go out? MCMASTER: Well, the president doesn\'t have to clear anything with me. But what the president’s tweet is it’s very consistent with this policy. I think what\'s important to understand with both the Iran policy and with the North Korea policy, the president gave us very clear guidance at the outset. We delivered as the national security team multiple options to the president, had broad ranging discussions, the president has made decisions on very coherent, well laid out strategies and that\'s what we’re executing now. ROSEN: I want to ask about the tweet, though. Do you and the president perceive (ph) from a shared view that public integrations of another head of state, an attempt at publicly humiliating an adversary on the world stage with a derisive term like "little rocket man", that that can have some positive strategic impact? MCMASTER: I think with a real danger is in terms of communicating with Kim Jong-un is that he doesn\'t understand how serious we are about his behavior and behavior of the regime. And the president has been very clear on that and I think that is -- it’s beneficial to the safety and security of not only the United States but our great allies in South Korea and Japan and the world. ROSEN: All right. We just have about a minute left, I want to ask about your 1997 book, "Dereliction of Duty: Johnson, McManara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Lies that Led to Vietnam". I was a big admirer of the book. It’s a deep archival study of how the joint chiefs were systematically excluded from policy-making in the process that gave us the quagmire in Vietnam. You wrote at the time: Those who question the direction of LBJ\'s policy were excluded from future deliberations on Vietnam. The president got the military advice he wanted. So, having made wartime dysfunction on the National Security Council your area of academic study, how do you apply the lessons you learned about the process in the Vietnam era to the running of the National Security Council today? MCMASTER: Well, it was a real gift to be able to study the National Security Council and decision-making within that National Security Council and with its interaction with the president from historical perspective. And I think history can\'t give you the answer to today\'s problems, but it can help you maybe avoid some mistakes of the past. So, it really highlighted for me what we owe the president within the National Security Council, is to coordinate and integrate efforts across all departments and agencies and provide the president with multiple options -- options that are based on clearly articulated goals and objectives that we derive from an understanding of vital interests, with U.S. vital interest. ROSEN: Would there be any policy stakeholders with equities in the process who would complain they\'ve been excluded in any way under H.R. McMaster? MCMASTER: No, what we have done is we are running a fully transparent process that empowers president’s very talented cabinet, to bring forward to him their best assessments and their best recommendations. What the president does is he asks very tough questions and I think you\'ve seen this in the development of a broad number of strategies from Cuba, to North Korea to South Asia. And so, what I think the president has done is helped us restore our strategic competence. He got the National Security Council out of the tactical day-to-day business and supervising cabinet officials who don\'t need supervision. They need -- they need support and they need effort to -- help in integrating their efforts with others. ROSEN: We will pursue all of this more with you the next time you come back here. MCMASTER: Thanks. It was a privilege to be with you. ROSEN: Thank you, General.Up next, the fate of the Iran deal now in the hands of Congress, and what the president\'s actions on health care might mean for you. Two key senators join us to discuss the looming battles on Capitol Hill, just ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ROSEN: President Trump\'s frustration with the Republican-led Congress for failing to help them deliver on some of his key campaign promises could mean an uphill battle ahead on Capitol Hill on everything -- from the Iran deal, to health care, to immigration. Two key senators, Republicans Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, excuse me, and Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut, are here to discuss. We begin here in Washington with you, Senator Murphy. Thanks for being here.You are a member of both the Foreign Relations and the Health Committees. So, firstly, what did you make of the remarks that you heard from General McMaster? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY, D-CONN., FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: Well, you were right to point out that there\'s not a single advisor around the president that advised him to decertify the Iran deal. The fact of the matter is, Iran is complying with the agreement. The White House is required to tell Congress if they are not and they have submitted absolutely no submissions. There is no chance that the deal is going to be renegotiated. The Iranians will not renegotiate it and neither will the Europeans. And so, if we were to pull all of this agreement as the president is threatening, Iran would get everything they want. They would be able to restart their nuclear program because we would be in violation of the deal, the Europeans would continue to grant them sanctions relief. Their economy would continue to grow, and they would look like the victim in this situation. So, there is absolutely nothing that accrues to our national security benefit if we ultimately fall out of this deal and it is an absolute fantasy to suggest that we are going to be able to restart negotiations. ROSEN: Still, even the Obama administration conceded a year ago that the nuclear deal, far from having a salutary effect on the Iran’s regional behavior, might actually have been emboldening it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: You can’t rule out that, in fact, this deal has served as a cause for this more aggressive posture. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, I can\'t rule that out. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: So, was in it high time, Senator, that the nuclear deal, specifically the threat of abrogating it, be used to try to curb Iran\'s more aggressive regional behavior? MURPHY: So, importantly, those of us that supported the Iran deal, did so with the knowledge that we could continue to pass additional sanctions to stop their other nefarious activity in the region and we did that. Earlier this year, Republicans and Democrats joined together to pass new sanctions against Iran\'s ballistic missile program. But you know what? The president hasn\'t implemented those sanctions. So, the White House can\'t complain that Iran is still acting in the deleterious manner in the region and then not implement the powers that we have given him to try to stop that behavior. We should be working together to take on their support for terrorism, their ballistic missile program, their miserable human rights record. But if you allow them to get back on the path to a nuclear weapon, their activity in the region supporting our enemies is even worse. It\'s even more threatening to us if they become a nuclear power in that region. That should be unacceptable and that\'s what the deal was about. ROSEN: You heard the president say the list of things that Iran has been doing that had been not in compliance with this deal, exceeding some of the enriched uranium stockpiles and so forth, you\'re not bothered by any of that? MURPHY: The president and his advisors have made it absolutely clear -- notwithstanding the president’s bizarre speech -- the Iranians are in compliance with the agreement. To the extent that there have been instances of noncompliance, they’ve gotten right back in compliance. Now, the president’s national security advisor is right, military sites are not automatically subject to inspection. But we have the right at any time, if we believe that there was nuclear activity happening on those sites, to request access. We have never had a problem with a request. We have never had an incident of noncompliance because of a request we made to get into those sites. ROSEN: All right. Let\'s move to health care. You serve on the Senate, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. The Trump administration, as you know, this past week, directed the federal government to stop payments of cost-sharing subsidies under ObamaCare. The president called it a payoff to the insurance industry. Why do you and your fellow Democrats oppose doing away with that? MURPHY: So, this is the equivalent of health care arson. He\'s really literally setting the entire health care system on fire just because the president is upset that the United States Congress won\'t pass a repeal bill that is supported by 17 percent of the American public. These subsidies going to the insurance companies help very low income people afford insurance. And without the subsidies, there will be many people who won\'t be able to provide insurance and afford it. And the other set of subsidies that go to individuals to access coverage will actually increase. Meaning that the deficit goes up, the amount of money that we spend overall on the Affordable Care Act goes up, because all that happens is the payments that used to be going to insurance companies now get substituted with increased tax credits for individuals to afford the coverage. The fact of the matter is the president is trying to sabotage the American health care system, trying to put a gun to the head of our constituents by taking away their health care or raising their costs in order to force us to repeal a bill that the American public doesn\'t want us to repeal. ROSEN: Arsons, guns to the head, this is pretty strong medicine in terms of the rhetoric in -- you know, I remember after Gabby Giffords was shot, we all wanted to tamp down the rhetoric and the use of these kinds of imagery and metaphor. But let\'s move to, in fact, the atrocity out in Las Vegas where authorities are still investigating and trying to find a motive, for this deadliest mass shooting in American history. We’re just two weeks away from that sickening event. Do you sense that the momentum on Capitol Hill to enact legislation to restrict gun ownership rights in some form or fashion, perhaps the bump stocks, has already subsided? MURPHY: I think there is willingness to take on this very narrow issue, bump stocks, which allow you to take a semiautomatic weapon and turn it into an automatic weapon. But I do think that you’re seeing the same pattern play out here -- thoughts and prayers from Congress, a little nibble of interest at legislative action and then we go back to the status quo. I just think that we can’t -- we can\'t continue to pretend that are loose and lax gun laws don\'t contribute to the rate of gun crime in this country. Nobody should have that kind of powerful weapon to be able to kill 50 people in a period of 10 to 15 minutes. Nobody should be able to turn that kind of weapon into an automatic weapon. The vast of gun owners in my state support commonsense gun restrictions because they don\'t need those kind of weapons to hunt and they don\'t think that criminals should be able to buy weapons. ROSEN: Would you be willing to accept new regulation of this bump stocks issue through ATF instead of congressional action? MURPHY: My worry is that the ATF didn\'t do it in 2010 because the law is actually ambiguous. And so, I think if we all agree that people shouldn\'t be able to turn these weapons into automatic weapons, then let\'s just pass a law through Congress. I think that it\'s a punt for Congress to tell the ATF to do it, when we know that the underlying problem is that the statue itself is very unclear on this matter.ROSEN: Punting as a metaphor on a football-infested Sunday, now, that’s appropriate. Senator Murphy, thank you very much for joining us here on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.MURPHY: Thanks a lot.ROSEN: Coming up, from Baton Rouge, Republican senator, Dr. Bill Cassidy. All right. Senator Cassidy, we appreciate you’re there. You’re live in studio. Given that the Republican-led Congress could not coalesce behind a legislative measure to repeal and replace ObamaCare, something that congressional Republicans and the president spent 2016 vowing that they would get done. Do you support the president’s use of executive authority effectively to gut the Affordable Care Act through administrative action? SEN. BILL CASSIDY, R-LA., HEALTH COMMITTEE: The president -- first, James, let me just push back. The president is not gutting the Affordable Care Act. Let\'s just take the cost-sharing reduction payments as one example. They’re unconstitutional. A court has said so. And with the president focusing on middle-class families who are paying $30,000 to $40,000 a year for premiums plus deductibles on top of this. Think about that, $30,000 to 40,000 a year. If there\'s something, which is damaging the credibility of the Affordable Care Act, is these premiums which are unaffordable, not that which the president is doing. ROSEN: Senator, not so long ago, you counseled the president against the very health care decision that he made this week. Let\'s listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CASSIDY: We’ve got to continue to think about that family around the kitchen table who cannot afford their premiums under the Affordable Care Act as it now is. So, we do not wish to do anything -- we don\'t want to make it worse for them. Now, the short-term continuation of the CSR payments, we call (ph) cost-sharing reduction, would be a part of that. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: So, Senator, do you still believe today as you did just two months ago that termination of these payments is going to make things worse for that family around the kitchen table? CASSIDY: But, first, as I said, they’re unconstitutional. If you played a little bit more of that clip, you would have heard me say that I think Congress should pass that short-term extension. And that’s actually what the president is asking. The payments are unconstitutional, according to a court, and his first responsibility is to uphold that. But we absolutely have to think about that family around the kitchen table, which is why I think Congress should pass them. Republicans have been trying to do so, but coupled with flexibility so that premiums can come down. Keep in mind, with those payments, that family is paying $30,000 to 40,000 a year. We’ve got to do something to lower their premiums. And so, if we continue on the short-term, have the regulatory flexibility to lower those costs and then do something like Graham-Cassidy to correct things long term, I think that\'s a good direction. ROSEN: But again, in the absence of the congressional action that you advise, the president now ordering the federal government to stop payments for these reimbursements. Is that going to help or hurt that family around the table? Yes or no?CASSIDY: If you -- if you take the totality of what the president did, I think it actually helps the family. So, those who are lowest income, the payments will still -- the subsidies will still go to insurance companies for them to buy their coverage. And someone told me that the CBO said they might pay a little bit less. If you speak about that family who’s just above federal poverty level, according to eHealth.com, a family of three making $82,000 a year, according to the Affordable Care Act definition, cannot afford their current policy on the exchange. They’re making $82,000 a year, and so, $30,000 to $40,000 is beyond their reach. The president also allowed flexibility for their employer to perhaps ban together in association health plans are for short-term insurance to be sold that would be much lower in cost to allow them to purchase that which they can afford. ROSEN: All right.CASSIDY: Right now, they can\'t afford -- let\'s give them a chance to buy something they can afford. ROSEN: Senator, some remarks made yesterday at the Values Voters Summit here in Washington by Steve Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, is generating a lot of buzz online this morning, particularly the threat that Mr. Bannon issued to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Let\'s hear it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Up on Capitol Hill, because I\'ve been getting calls, it\'s like before the Ides of March. They are just looking to find out who\'s going to be Brutus to your Julius Caesar. Yes, Mitch, the donors -- the donors are not happy, they’ve all left you. We’ve cut your oxygen off, Mitch. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: Senator Cassidy, I need a quick answer from you. Do you regard Steve Bannon as a real threat to Mitch McConnell and the Republican establishment? CASSIDY: I think where there\'s a real threat to the Republican establishment is not addressing the needs of that family around the kitchen table. If we take care of that family, good policy is good politics. ROSEN: All right. We’ll await your thoughts on Steve Bannon for another occasion. Senator Cassidy, thank you for your time today. Up next, we’ll bring in our Sunday group to discuss how the president’s bold use of executive authority will impact ObamaCare and the Americans who rely on it. Plus, three weeks after Maria, Puerto Rico remains a disaster zone, with most of the island still without power. We’ll assess the president\'s response to the crisis, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)JAMES ROSEN, FOX ANCHOR: Coming up, President Trump seeks the support of Chuck and Nancy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What would be nice if the Democratic leaders could come over to the White House, we\'ll negotiate some deal that\'s good for everybody. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: We\'ll ask our Sunday panel if a bipartisan deal can be reached on health care, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Democrats should come to me. I would even go to them because I\'m only interested in one thing, getting great health care for this country. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: President Trump calling for bipartisan support on health care reform, just hours after he used executive authority to terminate payments for ObamaCare. And it is time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl rove, Marie Harf, a State Department official in the Obama administration, Gerald Seib from The Wall Street Journal and the head of Heritage Action for America, Michael Needham. Friends all, welcome. Karl, it\'s estimated that three out of five customers who rely on healthcare.gov also rely on subsidies and the kind that the president ordered the federal government to stop paying this week. That amounts to about 6 million people. With our eyes on the 2018 midterms, does that make smart, political sense?KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the real question is, did it make constitutional sense. Article One, Section Nine of the Constitution says, no money shall be drawn from a Treasury but in consequence of appropriation made by law. Senator Murphy said this was health care arson. I wonder what he would think if President Trump said, you know what, I don\'t need an appropriation from Congress. I\'m going to build a wall by just sending the money out of the Treasury. What if he said, you know what, I think the military needs more money, I don\'t care that the Congress won\'t appropriated it, I\'m going to spend more money. That\'s exactly what happened on this. ROSEN: All right.ROVE: So -- so, yes, it -- it -- it is constitutionally wrong. Now we\'ve got to fix it. And when we fix it, we ought to -- simply piling more money into the subsidies into the insurance companies is not going to fund and fix the fundamental flaw to the Affordable Care Act, which is, it is -- it is structured so that we don\'t get enough younger, healthier people in the process to subsidize the older, less healthy people. ROSEN: Those 6 million people might not make the subtle distinctions about Article One that you just did. And, by the way, we want the viewers to know that Karl was reading from notes. He did not have Article One memorized.Michael Needham, I dug up -- I spent the weekend digging up old quotes of yours, reliably criticizing President Obama over the years for his use of executive authority here and there as unlawful, a threat to our separation of powers government. I will spare you the reading of these old quotes of yours. I just want to know if President Trump\'s use of executive orders and administrative authority on everything from health care to environmental policy troubles you just as much. MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: No, I mean it goes back to what Karl just said, nobody has a problem with executive action. We have a constitutional system that sets up a very robust executive branch of government. People had a problem with unconstitutional executive action. ObamaCare is very clear, there is no appropriation for bailouts to insurance companies. Now, because ObamaCare is unstable, the assumption that those bailouts would be given is critical to it. And what President Trump has done -- has said is that he\'s not going to continue to make those unconstitutional bailouts. Similarly, President Obama regulated short-term limited duration health plans, which are a great life boat away from ObamaCare for people who are suffering under it. President Trump is putting forth a proposal to allow those lifeboats to be used. The challenge of ObamaCare is that it\'s so fundamentally unstable that when people start getting into the short term limited durations like boats, It further destabilizes an incoherent plan. When you stop making unconstitutional payments to insurance companies, it starts destabilizing in a coherent plan. The challenges with ObamaCare is not what the president faithfully executing the duties of his office.ROSEN: So the frequency of Mr. Trump\'s resort to executive orders doesn\'t bother you? NEEDHAM: Well, I think the frequency of executive orders, which has gotten, you know, much worse under President Obama is obviously something that we need to go back to a constitutional system where the Congress steps out, does its job. ROSEN: All right.NEEDHAM: Both Trump and President Obama have been frustrated by a Congress that can\'t do its job. We all want to get back to that separation of powers. We should look at each of these individually and see whether the president is acting safely within the powers given to him. And I think that this past week the president has. ROSEN: I\'m going to turn to Iran. And, Marie, I\'m very happy for this opportunity to add to the existing body to Rosen-Harf transcripts from all of those State Department briefings we were in together.MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I know. I know.ROSEN: In withholding certification of Iran\'s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, the president -- and we\'ll listen to him do it - - cited multiple violations.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: On two separate occasions, they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water. Until recently, the Iranian regime has also failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges. The Iranian regime has also intimidated international inspectors. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: So does that sound like compliance to you? HARF: Well, I think President Trump is taking a few liberties here with some of the facts. It is true on heavy water that when they were very briefly out of compliance, they immediately came back in compliance. ROSEN: Twice. HARF: As you know -- twice. That\'s right. As you know, these are very complicated arms control agreements. And when there are implementation issues, how you can judge an agreement is whether they can be resolved, resolved quickly and today everyone, including General Mattis, a number of other people, General Dunford, have been very clear that Iran is in compliance. The president just doesn\'t like the agreement. I think because President Obama was the one to do it. Also because he -- he wishes that it looked at things like ballistic missiles or support for terrorism. And the fact is, there are better ways to deal with all those other issues and to make sure Iran is complying and crossing every T and dotting every I. There are better ways to do that than threatening to blow the whole thing up, or kicking it into Congress, which really throws it into this really uncertain place. And I don\'t have any faith that Congress is going to do the right thing here.ROSEN: Jerry Seib, is the president backing himself into a corner in essence by making his -- his sole leverage on this whole deal, his willingness to walk away from it when, if he does that, the Iranians can just flip the switch and made the mad dash towards a -- towards a bomb?GERALD F. SEIB, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, look, I mean we are entering a six-month period of great uncertainty in which that question is going to be answered. I mean especially what happens now is the guys behinds you (ph) in Congress have to decide if they\'re going to re-impose sanctions. Ironically, people who don\'t like the deal, starting with Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, do not want to move immediately to imposing the additional sanctions on Iranians because that will blow up the deal. The Europeans will stay in the agreement. The U.S. will walk away from it. Whether the Iranians continue to comply with -- at that point or not, who knows?I think what\'s going to -- what the attempts now is going to be, to get the Iranians to renegotiate parts of this agreement. I agree with Senator Murphy, I don\'t think that\'s very likely to happen. So I think we\'re headed toward a situation in which Congress is going to do what it usually does, which is not very much and it will be six months from now in a situation which, as you suggest, the president\'s going to have to decide, now do I pull the plug on the deal entirely or not. I don\'t know how that changes between now and then.ROSEN: All right, panel, we\'re going to take a break right here.But when we come back, President Trump and Republican Senators Bob Corker\'s ongoing war of words. The Senate Foreign Relations chair now claiming the president is undermining his own secretary of state\'s diplomatic efforts. That plus Puerto Rico when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KELLY, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I was not sent into, or brought into, control him, and you should not measure my effectiveness as a chief of staff by what you think I should be doing. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: White House Chief of Staff General John Kelly making a surprise appearance at Thursday\'s daily press briefing, in part to dispel speculation about his future in the West Wing.We are now back with our panel. Karl, as a veteran of the Katrina experience, I do just want to ask you how you feel that President Trump is responding. He posted a tweet on Thursday after he had already received a fair amount of criticism for his response to that crisis saying, we cannot keep FEMA, the military, and the first responders, who have been amazing under the most difficult circumstances, in Puerto Rico forever. How is he doing and what do you make of the criticism? KARL: Well, this followed on his comment when he was on the ground in Puerto Rico saying, well, you know, fortunately for you, this isn\'t a real disaster like Katrina was, which didn\'t sell very well in a -- in an island that has 80 percent of its power gone in 40 percent of its water on and 80 percent of its cell phone towers down. So my understanding is, my sense is, the administration\'s moving to rectify this by appointing a -- by appointing a recovery czar and they\'d be smart to do so. ROSEN: Interesting. All right, a little bit of news here on the program. That epic feud between President Trump and its fellow Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, only intensified this past week with Corker openly fretting that Mr. Trump might be setting us, quote, on the path to World War III. For his part, the president disparaged Corker on Twitter as "little Bob Corker." (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is that helpful to your agenda? REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., HOUSE SPEAKER: It\'s what he does. And we\'ve kind of learned to live with it. ROSEN: Jerry Seib, we\'re all chuckling, but I gather you have never seen anything like this in all your years in Washington. It is almost a mathematic certainty that one of these two men will pay a heavier price than the other for this. Who will that be? SEIB: Well, it\'s hard to see what Bob Corker has to lose at this point. I mean he\'s not running for re-election. He\'s -- you know, he barely considers himself part of the same party as President Trump right now. I think the odd situation is that the president has gotten himself alienated from Bob Corker, who\'s the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and John McCain, who\'s chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, at a time when two very big national security issues, the Iran deal and North Korea, are coming to full blow. I just don\'t think that\'s a good situation. Now, having said all that, I think one of the things we\'ve learned in the last eight or nine months is that you have to step back from the kind of junior high level rhetoric and look at what people do, not what they say. And my guess is Bob Corker will continue to work with the administration on the Iran deal and John McCain will continue to work with the administration on North Korea. And, in fact, he had some good things to say about the president on his Iran speech already this week. So the rhetoric is probably worse than the reality, but I don\'t think the reality is perfect by any means. ROSEN: Michael, the president\'s supporters seem to like it, seem to view it as kind of Harry Truman giving them hell when he goes after establishment figures in this way, even when they are in his own party. So my question to you is, is there political capital to be derived from the president in his public criticism of a Bob Corker or a Jeff Sessions or a Rex Tillerson? NEEDHAM: Well, I think the president is channeling a frustration that many Americans around the country have, both at a Congress that is not capable of legislating, of getting tax reform done, of getting ObamaCare done, and a Republican establishment that has often been out of touch with the real anxieties that people face, lest they be economic anxieties or a feeling that in Washington, D.C., that they don\'t have voice. And I think that\'s what the president is frustrated by. That\'s what he\'s articulating by. And we need to figure out, as a party, how do we come together, how do we accept that this is a president who made a more correct diagnosis of where the country is than any of the establishment Republicans who typically run for party or run for president. How do we come alongside that diagnosis? How do we tie it to principle and come forward with an agenda that unifies the party? That\'s the act that we need to be involved in right now and it\'s a frustrating process and it\'s not going as well as it needs to be. ROSEN: But he was also more accurate than a lot of the posters and other wielders of big data who are supposed to have the answers of everything in advance. All right, let\'s turn to the Democrats now. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the 84-year-old Democrat from California, who is the Senate\'s oldest member, announced this week she will seek re-election for a fifth full term, which, if served in full, would take Ms. Feinstein past her 92nd birthday. Not long after announcement, published reports indicated a likely primary challenge from this man, Kevin De Leon, leader of California\'s state senate. Mr. De Leon represents the Los Angeles area, is 50 years old, has close to a decade of experience in state politics and is Latino. Marie Harf, as a Democrat, is it healthy for the party to have leaders like Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer and Dianne Feinstein, all of whom are in their late 70s, even their mid-80s, for a party that places such a premium on progressivism and novelty and youth? HARF: Well, I don\'t think age is the question, right? I think that any party that -- ROSEN: That is my question. HARF: Well, I\'m saying it shouldn\'t be the question.ROSEN: All right. HARF: Any part that loses like we lost in 2016 should do soul-searching. I think that\'s natural, right? It always happens. What\'s been interesting is that the Republican Party, who won, has this really serious level of infighting too. That actually I\'ve been a little surprised about.So, yes, I think the Democratic Party needs new leaders. We need a message that makes clear to middle-class voters around the country why I believe and we believe our policies are best for them. But, look, if the Republican Party is going to spend its time and it\'s money primary challenge and a bunch of Republican senators instead of putting that money into ten Democratic Senate races where there are states where Donald Trump won in 2016, and we have venerable senators, I\'m not sure this is going to be a win for the Republicans. Sure, we have problems on the Democratic side, but speaking to what we were just talking about, the Republican Party has its own problems. And 2018, at this point, could really go either way. ROSEN: Karl --NEEDHAM: I appreciate the attempt to concern (ph) the Republican Party in response to a question about the attempted --HARF: That in turn (INAUDIBLE)?ROSEN: It is now.HARF: I like it.NEEDHAM: I think it\'s interesting. But I don\'t think the debate is actually an unhealthy thing. It\'s only liberals on college campuses who are afraid of a debate about the --HARF: Whoa, the college campus liberals.NEEDHAM: It\'s interesting, actually, if we want to talk about the Democratic Party, that Dianne Feinstein, who is a fierce opponent of the second amendment, and has been fiercely against free speech on college campuses, is insufficiently liberal for the hash tag left (INAUDIBLE). HARF: I don\'t think it\'s -- I don\'t think it\'s sufficiently liberal.ROSEN: So let me -- let me jump in here, just to ask Karl, given your great, vast experience with -- with campaigns and elections, do you think that Mr. De Leon, would you place odds on him, since he does seem to embody the -- more the current demographics of California, would you place odds on him defeating Senator Feinstein?KARL: I think she\'s formidable. But, look, this isn\'t just -- I agree with Marie, this is not just a question of age. But I disagree with Marie perhaps that age is not important. Age is important. If you take a look at the age break that was in the Democratic Party in Washington, it is between people like Seth Moulton and Tim Ryan who say, we need to have a message, like Marie said, that appeals to a middle class. That\'s not the big division of the Democratic Party.An interesting piece in this week\'s "New Republican" says, can\'t a socialist and the liberals get together and work together? The Democratic Party, outside of Washington, is split between a very hard left, the resistance that has energy and enthusiasm, and then you have the traditional liberals, like Dianne Feinstein. So De Leon is going to -- going to appeal to the hard left of the Democratic Party that in opposition to this president is going even more hard left and spinning out of control. ROSEN: All right. We have to leave it there just for the moment. I, too, by the way, am a newcomer to this term "concerned troll (ph)." It\'s time for a quick break. But when we return, President Trump starts a new front in his culture war, from the NFL to his pledge to return the country to its religious roots. That\'s just ahead (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Before watching a football game, you want to see those players be proud of their country, respect our country, respect our flag and respect our national anthem. And we think they will. We certainly hope they will. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: President Trump using his weekly address to go after NFL players kneeling during the playing of the national anthem. This a day after appealing to his evangelical base at the Values Voters Summit promoting a return to traditional American values. And we\'re back now for some bonus time with our panel. Jerry, this week saw President Trump become the first sitting president to visit the Values Voter Summit here in Washington. Let\'s listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The American founders invoked our creator four times in the Declaration of Independence. Four times. How times have changed. But, you know what, now they\'re changing back again. Just remember that. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROSEN: So, Jerry, are the times changing back again, or do we see it, as we look around us in America, that it\'s more progressive than ever and perhaps accepting of things like same-sex marriage? SEIB: Yes, it is both those things at the same time and that\'s why this was an interesting presentation by the president. I mean the Values Voter -- and, by the way, who would have guessed this a few years ago that Donald Trump was the champion of the value voters, but that\'s kind of what happened. And they form a large part of the Trump base right now. And he is speaking to them. And, obviously, the NFL protest, which you referred to, is an attempt to say something I think which was very important in 2016 and under appreciated, which is, a large part of the divide between Hillary Clinton voters and Donald Trump voters was cultural. It was not economic, it was cultural. And this is now shot through every political issue. We\'ve seen it in our polling. And, you know, conversations about issues like the NFL now play into that as well. And I think it dominates the entire political conversation in some ways. ROSEN: Karl, it was at Values Voter where we saw Steve Bannon issue that direct threat to Mitch. We\'re turning off the spigots, Mitch, et cetera. We\'re cutting off your oxygen. Is Steve Bannon a genuine threat to Mitch McConnell and the Republican establishment? ROVE: Not really. Think about the candidates he\'s recruited. The first candidate he went out and recruited to run for the House just got out of federal pen where he was for tax evasion, Michael Graham. ROSEN: From my home town of Staten Island, by the way.ROVE: Exactly. Danny Tarkadian (ph). He blessed him for a race for the United States Senate. He lost a race for state senate, secretary of state, a U.S. senator, and two races for Congress. May be the sixth time will be the winning time for him. ROSEN: Right.ROVE: How about the guy running in Wyoming, who lives in Abu Dhabi where he runs a security firm underwritten by a Chinese company with state ties that provides security to Chinese oil projects in Africa. I\'m not certain that people will want -- will be ready to elect somebody who\'s from Abu Dhabi. ROSEN: That\'s the first sentence in my life I\'ve heard that name checks Wyoming, Abu Dhabi and China right all in the same sentence. SEIB: And Karl does not have strong feelings about that at all.ROSEN: He wasn\'t reading from notes.Michael, the president in the remarks we just heard appear to be teeing up, perhaps as his next culture class issue, the so-called war on Christmas. The Real Clear Politics average of major reliable polling where the president\'s job approval rating is concerned places him right now at 38 percent. Briefly, are these kinds of appeals going to be the thing that brings them above 50 percent? NEEDHAM: Well, I think the number one challenge that our country has right now is a civic coming apart where there is not trust between our nation\'s elites and the rest of the country. The rest of the country feels that our elites would rather be at Davos or worrying about the problems of the world than worrying about real economic and other anxieties that people fell in this country. There\'s not a lot of charities being funded by our nation\'s donor class that are dealing with Mountain Dew mouth in Kentucky. And so I think dealing with that culture war, figuring out a way that instead of having a civic breaking, we can have a civic reawakening that brings us apart, is the most important challenge that we have as a nation. Clearly the president\'s doing it in a pretty very divisive way, which I don\'t think is going to be the way that we come together as a nation, but we need to figure out how we pull ourselves together, how we fight battles between a progressive left that does want to tear us away from our civic ties and do it in a way that\'s tied to policy and where the president can use that momentum to get things done. ROSEN: Very quickly. Today\'s football games are the first Sunday matchup since the league, the commissioner, wrote to team presidents and league executives urging them to try to persuade their players to stand during the national anthem. Marie Harf, two parts, very quickly, we have about 60 seconds, do you believe racism to be endemic in American society, yes or no? HARF: In parts of it, yes. ROSEN: And do you believe that these athletes are correct to use this pressure point of the playing of the national anthem in order to press their point? HARF: Absolutely. And I think that they should be listened to. I think that the issues they\'re raising should be discussed in a serious, sustained way and not just be put aside because the president is trying to make this about patriotism and it\'s not. These players have said, we are patriotic. We love this country. But there are serious issues we have to talk about and we\'re not, as a nation, having that conversation. I want that to be the conversation, not these divisive, cultural wars that the president\'s trying to rely on because he\'s got nothing else done, like health care or tax reform or infrastructure. That\'s what I want to see. ROSEN: He\'s got some things done. His name is Neil Gorsuch. And he sits on the Supreme Court.HARF: And that\'s the -- that\'s the only thing that people can point to in terms of legislative accomplishment. They haven\'t done health care. They haven\'t done tax reform. They haven\'t done a number of things that he ran on and promised. And so I think he\'s going back to these cultural war to get his base fired up. It\'s not going to grow that number beyond that 35 percent you mentioned though. I think it\'s just going to solidify that number. ROSEN: In five seconds, Karl, yes or no, will this issue with the NFL go away anytime soon? ROVE: No. ROSEN: All right. You heard it from the oracle. Thank you, panel. We\'ll see you next Sunday. And that is it for today. I\'m James Rosen, sitting in for Chris Wallace. Have a great week. We will see you next "Fox News Sunday."Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

Sadly, the regime bans them from using Twitter. Ironic, don’t you think?”The IRGC, a secretive branch of Iran’s Armed Forces, was the subject of scrutiny recently when President Donald Trump authorized the U.S. Treasury Department to impose targeted sanctions against “its officials, agents, and affiliates.”TRUMP DECERTIFIES IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, SLAPS SANCTIONS ON IRGC IN BROADSIDE AT 'RADICAL REGIME'Referring to the IRGC as “the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism,” the president said, “Execution of our strategy beginswith a long overdue step ofimposing tough sanctions onIran's Islamic RevolutionaryGuard Corps. The revolutionary guard is theIranian supreme leader’s corruptpersonal terror force andmilitia.”Netanyahu said he was “sure that ordinary Iranians aren’t proud when the Revolutionary Guard murders innocent men and women around the globe,” adding, “One day the Iranian people will be free. Free to tweet, free to express how they felt when their dictators compared them to the Iranian version of ISIS.”The prime minister concluded: “So I have a simple message for Iran’s Foreign Minister: Delete your account.”", '', 'Tillerson Visits Iraq to Chilly Reception Over His Remarks on Iran-Backed Militias - The New York TimesBAGHDAD — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson slipped into Iraq Monday night after having spent the morning in Afghanistan, but his welcome in Baghdad was far less effusive as the Trump administration pushes to isolate Iran, an important Iraqi ally.The diplomatic challenges for the United States in Iraq have become a minefield of competing interests as the Islamic State surrenders the last of its Iraqi territory and a host of squabbling groups fight to fill the vacuum.After meeting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq, Mr. Tillerson called for unity in the country, long troubled by sectarian and tribal divisions.Last week, the Iraqi military seized Kirkuk, wresting the contested city from Kurdish forces, which control much of the northern third of the country. Both sides in the struggle for Kirkuk have been crucial American allies in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh.“We are concerned and have been saddened by the recent differences that have emerged between the Kurdistan regional government and the Iraqi central government,” Mr. Tillerson said in statements made to reporters after he had met with Mr. Abadi.Asserting that “we have friends” in Baghdad and the Kurdish region’s capital, Erbil, Mr. Tillerson said “we encourage both parties to enter into discussion and dialogue.”Hours before Mr. Tillerson arrived, Mr. Abadi’s office released a testy statement rejecting Tillerson’s call the previous day for Iranian-backed militias — known as popular mobilization forces or Hashad al-Shaabi — to either disband or leave Iraq.Although the militias may be armed and trained by Iran, the militia members are Iraqis.“We wonder about the statements attributed to the American secretary of state about the popular mobilization forces,” the statement from the prime minister’s office said.The militias were recruited and integrated into the Iraqi military in 2014 after Islamic State militants swept through parts of Iraq and seized nearly a third of the country despite years of effort and billions of dollars spent by the United States to train government forces.A top Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassam Suleimani, has advised the militias inside Iraq, prompting some Iraqi lawmakers to describe them as an arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps.The militias maintain individual commands separate from the Iraqi military command and often fly Shiite banners and flags at Iraqi Army checkpoints.Members of the militias are Iraqi patriots who “have sacrificed greatly to defend their country,” Mr. Abadi’s statement said. “No side has the right to intervene in Iraq’s affairs or decide what Iraqis should do.”In a news conference on Sunday with Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir of Saudi Arabia, Mr. Tillerson said that “Iranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fight against Daesh and ISIS is coming to a close, those militias need to go home. Any foreign fighters in Iraq need to go home and allow the Iraqi people to regain control of areas that had been overtaken by ISIS.”Aides later tried to clarify his remarks as only meaning that Iraq’s military needed a unified chain of command, but the Trump administration’s fiercely anti-Iran rhetoric — President Trump has denounced Iran repeatedly and threatened to renounce the Iran nuclear deal — has discomfited Iraqis.A spokesman for the popular mobilization forces, Ahmed al-Assadi, told the Iraqi Parliament in Baghdad on Monday that he considered Mr. Tillerson’s comments an “unacceptable and false accusation.”Mr. Assadi, a Shiite member of Parliament, said Mr. Tillerson’s remarks reflected a “lack of experience.”The Americans have encouraged improvements in Iraq’s relations with Sunni Arab states in hopes of reducing Iran’s influence. Mr. Abadi was in Riyadh on Sunday along with Mr. Tillerson to strengthen ties.Earlier Monday, Mr. Tillerson made a secret two-hour visit to the main American air base in Afghanistan, arriving in a military transport plane to meet top Afghan officials inside a massive bunker.His visit to Iraq was similarly unannounced before he landed.That top American officials must use stealth to enter these countries after more than 15 years of war, thousands of lives lost and trillions of dollars spent was testimony to the stubborn problems still confronting the United States in both places.Mr. Tillerson would not even risk the short trip to Kabul from Bagram Air Base to visit the heavily fortified United States Embassy or Afghan presidential palace, as his predecessors have done. The change reflects the increasingly uncertain security situation in Kabul and the fact that the United States’ presence is now surrounded by vast Taliban-controlled areas.Mr. Tillerson’s visit was his first to Afghanistan as secretary of state, and like nearly every other top American official to visit over the previous two decades, he said the country’s predicament was not nearly as dire as his own security precautions suggested.“But I think if you consider the current situation in Afghanistan, and we were talking about this a few minutes ago, and you look a few years in the past to what the circumstances were, Afghanistan has come quite a distance already in terms of creating a much more vibrant population, a much more vibrant government, education system, a larger economy,” he said in a small windowless conference room during a hurried eight-minute news conference. “So there are opportunities to strengthen the foundations of a prosperous Afghanistan society.”Cloistered in the American military compound, Mr. Tillerson saw none of that hoped-for blooming. Instead, he and his staff exited a huge military transport plane and then piled into a motorcade that drove them the few minutes to the base’s bunkerlike headquarters, passing hangars constructed by Russia, another of the foreign forces to be humbled in Afghanistan. Huge concrete blast walls lined much of the route. Helicopters patrolled the perimeter, and two security blimps equipped with long-range cameras hovered.After eight months of internal discussions, Mr. Trump in August announced his policy for Afghanistan. Commanders will be allowed to request troops as needed, and the administration emphasized that it would increasingly rely on regional partners like India to improve stability.Mr. Trump also promised to pressure Pakistan, which United States officials have long accused of playing a double game in Afghanistan — publicly supporting the United States presence while privately protecting the Taliban and other insurgent groups.The massive air base near Kabul demonstrates why the administration cannot get too tough with Pakistan, since nearly all of the supplies are transported by air or land through Pakistani territory. Soldiers can order supplies and gifts from Amazon, which delivers daily to the base.Mr. Tillerson will visit Islamabad on Tuesday for his first talks with Pakistani leaders since he delivered a speech last week in which he called for improved ties with India, Pakistan’s rival.On Monday, Mr. Tillerson said that the United States was increasingly concerned about the stability of Pakistan, which has a large nuclear arsenal.“Pakistan needs to, I think, take a cleareyed view of the situation that they’re confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organizations that find safe haven inside of Pakistan,” he said.', 'RIYADH, Saudi Arabia – U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is pressing Saudi Arabia and Iraq to form a united front to counter Iran\'s growing assertiveness in the Middle East.Tillerson has participated in the inaugural meeting of a Saudi-Iraqi coordination committee, along with the Saudi king and Iraq\'s prime minister.Tillerson tells those leaders that the meeting highlights already improving ties and "the great potential of the relations between your countries."Tillerson is seeking Saudi financial and political support for Iraq as Iraq struggles to rebuild after ousting the Islamic State group from major cities and deals with an independence movement in its northern Kurdish region.___Lee reported from Doha, Qatar.', 'BAGHDAD – With the Islamic State group driven from nearly all of Iraq, U.S. officials have suggested that the thousands of mainly Shiite paramilitary fighters who mobilized against the Sunni extremists three years ago lay down their arms.But Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who once battled U.S. troops and is now the deputy head of the state-sanctioned Popular Mobilization Forces, says they are here to stay."The future of the (PMF) is to defend Iraq," he told The Associated Press in his first extensive interview with a Western media outlet. "The Iraqi army and Iraqi police say they cannot operate without the support of the Hashd," he added, using a shortened Arabic term for the paramilitary force.In the years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, al-Muhandis led the Hezbollah Brigades, a feared Shiite militia with close ties to Iran and the Lebanese militant group of the same name. His real name is Jamal Jaafar Ibrahim, but he\'s still better known by his nom de guerre, and his rise to the top ranks of Iraq\'s security apparatus reflects the long, slow decline of U.S. influence over the country.He participated in the bombing of Western embassies in Kuwait and the attempted assassination of that country\'s emir in the early 1980s, for which he was convicted in absentia and added to the U.S. list of designated terrorists. But like many Shiite militants, he returned to Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Two years later, he was even elected to parliament, before being forced to step down under American pressure.In 2009, the State Department linked him to the elite Quds Force of Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard, calling him a "threat to stability" in Iraq, and as recently as last week it referred to him as a terrorist.But in the summer of 2014, when the Islamic State group swept across northern Iraq, and the U.S.-trained and funded army collapsed, his and other Shiite militias mobilized in defense, halting the extremists on the outskirts of the capital. The mostly Iran-backed militias remained separate from the U.S.-led coalition, but over the next three years they helped Iraq\'s reconstituted military to drive IS out of most of the country.Today, al-Muhandis, in his mid-60s, is among the most powerful men in Iraq, splitting his time between the front lines, Iran and his home and office in Baghdad\'s heavily-guarded Green Zone. He describes the PMF as a "parallel military" that will help keep the peace once IS is gone.Al-Muhandis "demonstrates that Iran has a direct venue with which to influence Iraqi politics, and a powerful one at that," said Philip Smyth, an expert on Shiite militias at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy."It\'s no secret," al-Muhandis said of his close relationship with Iran, the country where he spent decades in exile and underwent military training. He said he personally seeks spiritual and moral guidance from the country\'s leadership, but that the PMF only gets material support from Tehran.Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson demanded that Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq return to their homes, integrate into the Iraqi army or leave the country.Al-Muhandis casually dismissed the appeal. "Tillerson is asleep," he said."Iran was the only country that supported Iraq from the beginning of the Daesh crisis," he said, referring to the IS blitz in 2014. "It\'s like when you\'re in a hospital and you need blood. The Americans would be the one who would show up with the transfusion when it was too late."As to whether the Americans should remain in Iraq, Al-Muhandis said: "We follow the Iraqi government despite our personal opinions, and our personal opinions are well known, so I won\'t repeat them here."The PMF sprang into action again earlier this month, when federal forces retook the northern city of Kirkuk and other disputed areas from Kurdish forces in response to the Kurds\' vote for independence in September. The military action, which caused few casualties and was celebrated as a victory by the country\'s Arab majority, gave a further boost to the paramilitary forces."What happened in Kirkuk is a success for the Iraqi government and the Iraqi forces," Al-Muhandis said, adding that his forces had helped coordinate the Kurdish withdrawal to minimize clashes and casualties. "We want a brotherhood with the Kurds," he said, referring to their shared struggle against Saddam Hussein in the 1980s.The fighting nevertheless displaced thousands of people, according to the United Nations and Amnesty International, which documented the looting and destruction of "hundreds" of properties near Kirkuk.International rights groups alleged widespread violations by the militias throughout the campaign against IS and said the government had failed to hold them accountable. Al-Muhandis and other commanders say any abuses were isolated incidents, and that perpetrators have been brought to justice.Al-Muhandis rarely speaks to reporters, but his image is pervasive on social media, where he can be seen wearing olive fatigues and surveying front-line positions from Iraq\'s northern border to the western Anbar province, where troops and militiamen are battling IS in the last pocket under its control. He\'s often standing beside Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran\'s elite Quds Force, and a key adviser to the PMF. Music videos shared online praise al-Muhandis\' humility and fearlessness.He can also be seen in photos attending strategy meetings chaired by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. The PMF are officially an "independent military formation" under the prime minister\'s command.Al-Muhandis holds a "pivotal" position in Iraq\'s political and security hierarchy, said Nathaniel Rabkin, managing editor of Inside Iraqi Politics, a political risk assessment newsletter."It\'s a source of concern in and outside Iraq," Rabkin said. "If you have elements of the armed forces or the security forces loyal to a particular political party you\'re creating a setup where it will be very difficult to have free, fair and competitive elections that don\'t descend into violence."Iraq is set to hold parliamentary elections next year. When asked if his forces would participate in politics, al-Muhandis laughed, saying: "Don\'t mention it or you\'ll scare off all the politicians." He added that PMF fighters would be free to run for office, but must first leave the paramilitary organization.Smyth, the militia researcher, doubts such rules would be enforced, noting the long history of militia commanders cycling in and out of political office.Whether they run or not, Al-Muhandis said the PMF are "the biggest force that can influence the upcoming elections."', 'Lebanese Prime Minister Meets Macron After Mysterious Saudi Stay - The New York TimesPARIS — Lebanon’s absent prime minister arrived in France on Saturday morning after two weeks in Saudi Arabia, a mysterious stay that touched off intense speculation that he was being held against his will.The prime minister, Saad Hariri, who has not publicly explained the nature of his stay in Saudi Arabia, met with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for lunch at the Élysée Palace and confirmed that he would travel to Beirut later in the week.The meeting with Mr. Macron came hours after a phone call between Mr. Macron and the Lebanese president, Michel Aoun, the French president’s office said. Officials said that Mr. Aoun had thanked Mr. Macron for “France’s actions in favor of Lebanon” and confirmed that Mr. Hariri would be in Beirut for Lebanon’s Independence Day holiday, which is Wednesday.Mr. Hariri later said in statements to the news media that he would announce his position on the crisis in his country after holding talks with Mr. Aoun.“As you know, I have resigned and we will speak about this matter there,” Mr. Hariri told reporters, referring to Lebanon, as he was leaving the Élysée Palace, where he met with Mr. Macron for over 30 minutes, before gathering for lunch with his wife, their oldest son and Mr. Macron’s wife.After the meeting, officials in the French president’s office announced that Mr. Macron was considering gathering in Paris the members of the United Nations International Support Group for Lebanon, although no specific date was given.French officials refused to say whether Mr. Hariri had explained to Mr. Macron the reason for his mysterious stay in Saudi Arabia or the circumstances around the announcement of his resignation.Mr. Hariri’s office said earlier on Saturday that his wife, Lara, and their son Houssam would be present at the lunch in the Lebanese prime minister’s honor at the Élysée Palace. Mr. Hariri’s wife had accompanied him on the flight from Saudi Arabia, and his son was said to have flown in from Britain.Mr. Hariri’s two younger children, a 16-year-old daughter, Loulwa, and a 12-year-old son, Abdulaziz, did not appear in television footage of his arrival. The two have been attending school in Saudi Arabia and could have stayed behind for that reason, but their apparent absence was an obstacle to ending concerns that Mr. Hariri was not acting freely. It left room for speculation that the Saudis had pressured Mr. Hariri to leave them in the country as leverage.Mr. Hariri announced on Nov. 4 from Riyadh, the Saudi capital, that he was stepping down as Lebanon’s prime minister, but officials in Lebanon have said that his departure would not take effect until he delivered his resignation in person in Beirut.Mr. Hariri’s unexpected trip and resignation unsettled the Middle East, setting off a political crisis in Lebanon and even raising fears of war. Saudi Arabia was widely seen as pressuring Mr. Hariri to resign as part of its escalating regional feud with Iran and its effort to isolate Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia and political party that is part of Mr. Hariri’s coalition government.Mr. Hariri said he feared for his safety in Lebanon.With European diplomats scrambling to defuse the crisis, France seized the role of mediator. Mr. Macron made a surprise visit to Riyadh on Nov. 9. A week later, the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, met Mr. Hariri in the Saudi capital.Mr. Macron’s deputy adviser on diplomacy also traveled from Paris to Lebanon during the crisis, while Mr. Macron was having “direct and frequent” contacts with leaders in the region, including President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, according to officials in the French president’s office.France has strong ties to Lebanon, where it was a former colonial ruler, and to the Hariri family.“It’s an occasion for France to show that it can be an intermediary and have a role in the crises of the Middle East,” Rima Tarabay, an adviser on European affairs for Mr. Hariri, said in a phone interview.But Ms. Tarabay added that the crisis went beyond Mr. Hariri’s announced resignation, which has plunged the political situation of Lebanon in uncertainty.“We are facing a very complex situation, not specifically tied to Saad’s personal issue, but regarding what is going to happen next,” Ms. Tarabay said, raising concerns about the potential “resurgence of violence in the region, and a war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.”At a European Union summit meeting on Friday, Mr. Macron told journalists that France did not want to choose sides in the Middle East, adding that “the role of France is to talk to everyone.” However, he urged Iran to pursue a “less aggressive regional strategy.”On Saturday, Mr. Hariri met at his residence in France with two of his closest advisers, Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk and Nader Hariri, a senior aide. Many of the prime minister’s most trusted advisers had been out of touch or only in rare contact with him during his Saudi stay.At 1:10 a.m. on Saturday in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Hariri wrote on Twitter that he was “on the way to the airport.” His tweet mentioned Sigmar Gabriel, the foreign minister of Germany, who had asked whether the Saudis were holding Mr. Hariri.Saudi Arabia later said on Saturday that it would formally protest Mr. Gabriel’s remarks and that it would recall its ambassador to Germany.Mr. Hariri had arrived in Riyadh just as Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, put many of the country’s most wealthy and powerful men, including some members of the royal family, under de facto arrest in what has been described as an anti-corruption sweep.His visit also came as the Saudis accused Iran-backed rebels in Yemen of firing a missile at Riyadh. It was not clear if Mr. Hariri’s trip was related to these events.In Lebanon, many questions remain, including whether Mr. Hariri will hand in his resignation or rescind it, and whether the government will be reorganized.“The crisis of the resignation and Hariri’s return is now finished, but a political crisis has just begun,” Lebanon’s Parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, said on Friday after news emerged that Mr. Hariri would fly to Paris.Regardless of his next moves, Mr. Hariri will remain beholden to Saudi Arabia. His personal and family finances are deeply entwined with the country, which has also backed his party’s extensive political patronage network and media outlets. But the Saudi gambit to get him to take a more confrontational approach against Iran and Hezbollah could backfire.Mr. Hariri could end up presiding over a caretaker government ahead of elections planned for next year. Analysts and diplomats said that Saudi Arabia was likely to gain little more than a renewed rhetorical commitment from all sides to Lebanese neutrality.Tension had been building during the year since Mr. Hariri formed a national unity government in a deal that brought Mr. Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, to the presidency.Hezbollah gained new power and weaponry while helping President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, another Iran ally, beat back insurgents. Mr. Aoun began signaling plans to normalize relations with the Syrian government, with members of his party even meeting with Syrian diplomats in New York during the annual General Assembly gatherings. That was too much for some of Mr. Hariri’s allies and supporters, and for Riyadh.Mr. Hariri reached out to Jordan with a request to go to Amman as a safe haven, a Western official said. The request was denied, the official said, because the Saudis had pressured Jordan not to accept him.A spokeswoman at the Embassy of Jordan in Washington denied that such a request had been made.Assessing what Mr. Hariri’s stay in France would mean for the crisis in Lebanon going forward, an official in the French president’s office said the move had likely contributed to easing the current tensions but was unlikely, he added, to bring them to any definitive conclusion.', 'Attention: Saudi Prince in a Hurry - The New York TimesTo understand the upheaval that is taking place in Saudi Arabia today, you have to start with the most important political fact about that country: The dominant shaping political force there for the past four decades has not been Islamism, fundamentalism, liberalism, capitalism or ISISism.It has been Alzheimer’s.The country’s current king is 81 years old. He replaced a king who died at 90, who replaced a king who died at 84. It’s not that none of them introduced reforms. It’s that at a time when the world has been experiencing so much high-speed change in technology, education and globalization, these successive Saudi monarchs thought that reforming their country at 10 miles an hour was fast enough — and high oil prices covered for that slow pace.It doesn’t work anymore. Some 70 percent of Saudi Arabia is under age 30, and roughly 25 percent of them are unemployed. In addition, 200,000 more are studying abroad, and about 35,000 of them — men and women – are coming home every year with degrees, looking for meaningful work, not to mention something fun to do other than going to the mosque or the mall. The system desperately needs to create more jobs outside the oil sector, where Saudi income is no longer what it once was, and the government can’t keep eating its savings to buy stability.That’s the backdrop for this week’s daring, but reckless, power play by the 32-year-old son of King Salman — Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known by his initials M.B.S. I’ve interviewed M.B.S. twice. He is a young man in a hurry. I’ve found his passion for reform authentic, his support from the youth in his country significant and his case for making radical change in Saudi Arabia compelling.Indeed, there are two things I can say for sure about him: He is much more McKinsey than Wahhabi — much more a numbers cruncher than a Quran thumper. And if he did not exist, the Saudi system would have had to invent him. Somebody had to shake up the place.But here is what I don’t know for sure: Where does his impulse for rapid reform stop and his autocratic impulse to seize all power begin? After M.B.S. arrested a slew of Saudi princes, media owners and billionaire businessmen on “corruption” charges, President Trump tweeted his applause, saying, “Some of those they are harshly treating have been ‘milking’ their country for years!”I could only laugh reading that tweet. Hearing that Saudi princes were arrested for “corruption” is like reading that Donald Trump fired seven cabinet secretaries “for lying.” You know it has to be something else. Trump obviously missed the story last year that M.B.S. impulsively bought a yacht while on vacation in the south of France — it just caught his fancy in the harbor — from its Russian owner for $550 million. Did that money come out of his piggy bank? Savings from his Riyadh lemonade stand? From his Saudi government 401(k)?I raise this point because when you’re making as many radical changes at once, and making as many enemies at once, as M.B.S. is, your robes need to be very clean. People have to believe that you mean what you say and that you have no hidden agendas, because change is going to be painful. Look at what M.B.S. is doing all at once:To speed up decision-making, he is reshaping the Saudi state — from a broad family coalition where power is shared and alternated among seven major families and decisions taken by consensus — to a state governed by a single family line. This is no longer “Saudi Arabia.” It is becoming “Salman Arabia.” In the latest series of arrests, M.B.S. basically eliminated the “young old guard” — the key sons and his natural rivals from the other main Saudi royal lines. He also arrested the owners of the three main quasi-independent private television networks, MBC, ART and Rotana.At the same time, M.B.S. is shifting the basis of legitimacy of the regime, ending “the 1979 era.” In 1979, in the wake of the takeover of Islam’s most holy site in Mecca by an ultra-fundamentalist Saudi preacher who claimed that the al-Saud family was not Islamic enough, the Saudi ruling family — to shore up its religious legitimacy — made a sharp religious turn at home and began exporting its puritanical Wahhabi Sunni Islam abroad, building mosques and schools from London to Indonesia.It has been a disaster for the Arab/Muslim world, spawning offshoots like Al Qaeda and ISIS and retarding Arab education and women’s advancement.M.B.S. has vowed to give birth to a more moderate Saudi Islam, starting by curbing his religious police and permitting women to drive. This is hugely important. He is daring people to judge his government not on piety but on performance, not on Quran but on KPIs — key performance indicators on unemployment, economic growth, housing and health care.But he is replacing Wahhabism as a source of solidarity with a more secular Saudi nationalism, one that has a strong anti-Iran/Persian/Shiite tenor. And that is taking him to some dangerous places. To confront Iran, M.B.S. got the Sunni Prime Minister of Lebanon, Saad al-Hariri, to quit his office on Saturday while on a visit to Riyadh, and blamed Iran and its Shiite allies for making Lebanon ungovernable — and for a missile attack from Yemen. Lebanon, which had forged a relatively stable balance among Sunnis, Christians and Shiites, is now shaking. M.B.S. also led a Gulf effort to isolate Qatar for being too close to Iran and to crush Iran’s influence in Yemen — and crush Yemen in the process. It’s overreach, and there seems to be no one around to tell him that.As a veteran Saudi journalist remarked to me of M.B.S.: “This guy saved Saudi Arabia from a slow death, but he needs to broaden his base. It is good that he is freeing the house of Saud of the influence of the clergy, but he is also not allowing any second opinion of his political and economic decisions.”I worry that those urging M.B.S. to be more aggressive in confronting Iran (whose malign regional influence does need counterbalancing) — like the U.A.E., Trump, Jared Kushner and Bibi Netanyahu — will push M.B.S. into a war abroad and at home at the same time, and we could see Saudi Arabia and the whole region spin out of control at the same time. As I said, I’m worried.', 'BEIRUT – Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri\'s bombshell resignation in a televised speech from Saudi Arabia took the nation by surprise Saturday.In his announcement, Hariri accused Iran and its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, of holding Lebanon hostage and destabilizing the Arab region.But what is behind his resignation and what does it mean for Lebanon?THE BACKGROUNDHariri became prime minister in late 2016 in a coalition government that included the Shiite militant group Hezbollah.It has been an uneasy partnership between Hariri, a Sunni Muslim aligned with Saudi Arabia, and Hezbollah, Iran\'s Shiite proxy in Lebanon, which has sent thousands of its fighters to shore up President Bashar Assad\'s forces in Syria\'s civil war.As Hezbollah and Iranian-backed Syrian troops made successive military victories, Hariri came under pressure from Washington and Riyadh to distance himself from the group.In recent days, Lebanese government ministers have bickered publicly over sending an ambassador to Damascus and repatriation plans for hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees living in Lebanon. Officials denied the tension threatened the unity government.Then suddenly, Hariri flew to Saudi Arabia earlier this week in a previously unannounced trip. He flew again to Riyadh Friday.It is not clear what exactly prompted his shock resignation — unprecedented in the way it was announced in a televised address from an undisclosed location in Riyadh. Even close aides seemed not to know it was coming.In his speech, Hariri said he feared for his life, suggesting he may not be coming home soon. Hariri was prime minister from 2009 until 2011, when Hezbollah ousted him from office. He had until last year lived in self-imposed exile in Saudi Arabia and France.SAUDI IRAN RIVALRYHariri\'s resignation is a reflection of the growing power struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia in the region. The Iran-Saudi rivalry is rooted in both countries\' claim to represent different strands of Islam, Shiite and Sunni, a more than thousand-year-old dispute. Iran\'s Islamic revolution in 1979 unsettled the ultraconservative Sunni Kingdom. But the explosive modern race grew with Iran\'s rising influence in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, where Tehran is supporting various players.Hezbollah, one of Tehran\'s most reliable partners, has been a key player in the wars in Syria and Yemen, undermining Saudi clout in Syria, and reaching the kingdom\'s borders by supporting Yemen\'s anti-Saudi rebels.With the ascension of the ambitious firebrand Mohammed Bin Salman to crown prince in Saudi Arabia, the rivalry with Tehran took a sharper turn. In one interview, he threatened to take the war to Iran.WHAT HAPPENS NOWHariri\'s resignation has to be accepted by President Michel Aoun, a formality. It effectively shatters the national unity government and plunges the country into uncertainty and potentially a prolonged period of political paralysis.Aoun must appoint a new prime minister, but it will be difficult to find a consensual Sunni figure able to form another coalition government. According to Lebanon\'s sectarian-based power-sharing system, the president must be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Muslim Sunni and the parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim.A new government that leans further toward Hezbollah would risk isolating the country and subjecting it to U.S. sanctions.POTENTIAL INSTABILITYAlready, Lebanon\'s Hezbollah has been targeted by U.S. sanctions aimed to block the flow of money to the group, a move that threatened to cause major damage to the country\'s solid banking sector if passed into law. Washington considers Hezbollah to be a terrorist organization and U.S. lawmakers called it Iran\'s leading "terrorist proxy."With Israel, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. seeing eye to eye on the need to stem Iran\'s growing clout, many fear Lebanon may be the place for a showdown with Iran\'s ally, Hezbollah.Israel and Hezbollah have fought a number of wars, the last of which ended in a stalemate in 2006. Israel has recently said it will not tolerate an Iranian presence in Syria, spearheaded by Hezbollah, which has also established a presence near the Syria-Israel border.___Associated Press writer Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.', 'A top DHS official also warns terrorists want to pull off another 9/11; Catherine Herridge goes in-depth for \'Special Report.\'WASHINGTON – Islamic State militants are capable of orchestrating and carrying out an attack against the United States, possibly downing an airplane, even after being evicted from their self-declared Syrian capital of Raqqa, the CIA director said Thursday.Mike Pompeo said the U.S. is threatened by other militant groups as well."IS\' capability to conduct an external operation remains," Pompeo said. "But I wouldn\'t put them in a singular bucket. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has for a long time had this mission statement, which includes the taking down of a commercial airliner bound for a western country. Certainly, among those would be the United States."Speaking a day after President Donald Trump\'s acting homeland security chief invoked the possibility of another 9/11-style attack, Pompeo said America\'s enemies around the world "are intent upon using commercial aviation as their vector to present a threat to the West." However, he also worried about a terrorist capability "we just don\'t see."The typically blunt threat assessment came during a wide-ranging discussion at a Washington think tank, in which Pompeo also underscored President Donald Trump\'s intent to counteract North Korea. He said Pyongyang is only months away from perfecting its nuclear weapons capabilities."They are closer now than they were five years ago, and I expect they will be closer in five months than they are today, absent a global effort to push back against them," Pompeo said. "From a U.S. policy perspective, we ought to behave as if we are on the cusp of them achieving that objective."On another nuclear concern, Iran, Pompeo stressed that Trump wants to ensure the U.S. foe has no pathway to developing the bomb. To that effect, he said, the Iran nuclear deal President Barack Obama and America\'s allies negotiated with Iran was insufficient.The notion that the agreement would "curtail Iranian adventurism or their terror threat or their malignant behavior has now ... two years on, proven to be fundamentally false," said Pompeo, a former Republican congressman from Kansas who keenly opposed to the seven-nation accord when it was reached.He said the Iran deal put the United States in a better place with respect to inspections of Iranian facilities. But from an intelligence perspective, he said, even more "intrusive inspection" is needed."The Iranians have on multiple occasions been capable of presenting a continued threat, through covert efforts to develop their nuclear program along multiple dimensions ... the missile dimension, the weaponization effort, the nuclear component itself," he said.Trump has provided the CIA with the authority it needs to track Iran\'s compliance with the deal, he said.Pompeo also said it\'s an "open secret" that Iran has links to al-Qaida."There have been relationships, there are connections. There have been times the Iranians have worked alongside al-Qaida," Pompeo said. "There have been connections where, at the very least, they have cuts deals so as not to come after each other."Pompeo and Trump\'s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, who also spoke at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies event, both said the U.S. must counter Iran\'s aggression in the region. They noted Iran\'s support for the Lebanon\'s Hezbollah militants, who threaten Israel; backing of Shia militias in Iraq and Syria; cyber activities; ballistic missile efforts; and a long history of proliferation ties with North Korea.Pompeo said Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard Corps controls as much as 20 percent of the Iranian economy. McMaster said the United States needs to raise the cloak on the IRGC\'s financial network and urge companies worldwide not to do business with it."Don\'t enrich the IRGC," McMaster said. "Don\'t enable their murderous campaign. Don\'t enable their threat to our friends in the region, especially Israel, but also Saudi Arabia and others."Pompeo also discussed Pakistan\'s help in getting an American woman, her Canadian husband and three children released last week from the Haqqani militant network. The couple had been held for five years inside Pakistan, he said.', 'ISIS, Squeezed on Two Sides, Loses Syrian City and Border Crossing - The New York TimesBEIRUT — Islamic State militants lost their last foothold in a major city and a strategic border crossing on Friday, as the Syrian and Iraqi militaries made significant advances, squeezing the militant group into a shrinking patch of territory near the border.Syrian government forces, supported by intense Russian airstrikes and Iranian-backed militias on the ground, drove the militants from the last few neighborhoods they controlled in the eastern provincial capital of Deir al-Zour, the Syrian army said.Across the border, the Iraqi army and allied Iranian-backed militias seized control of a crucial border crossing after taking most of the town of Qaim, Iraq, from the Islamic State, according to the Iraqi military chief of staff.The military advances dealt a severe blow to the militant group, leaving it with fragments of its self-declared caliphate that once stretched from the center of Syria to the outskirts of Baghdad. They also provided yet another indication that President Bashar al-Assad’s fortunes have rebounded and that, with help from Russian and Iranian allies, the Syrian army can take back territory.The Islamic State now maintains just a few pockets of western Anbar Province in Iraq and somewhat larger patches in Syria, where it controls about a third of the desert province of Deir al-Zour, including a string of small towns and villages, and an oil field.The developments also set the stage for a battle for the Syrian border town of Bukamal, on the strategic highway from Baghdad to Damascus, and what appears to be the end game for the remaining Islamic State territory in Iraq and Syria.The seizing of Deir al-Zour punctuates the turnaround Mr. Assad has managed in more than six years of war. Just two years ago, the idea that the government would manage to take back the city seemed remote.When the Syrian war broke out in 2011, soldiers were defecting from the Syrian army and only a fraction of the troops could be counted on for loyalty in the field. But Mr. Assad hit hard at rebel-held neighborhoods, pummeling Syrian cities with airstrikes with the support of Iran and its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah.In 2015, Russia entered the war on Mr. Assad’s behalf, carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic State and other insurgent factions. Russia’s backing allowed Mr. Assad’s forces to focus on one front at a time. Once the non-Islamic State insurgents were contained, the pro-government alliance turned its attention to the Islamic State, which it has now mostly routed.Still, Mr. Assad is faced with running a country that is still divided, politically and territorially, where major cities are devastated, the security forces deeply dependent on Russia and Iran, and the economy gutted.The government’s announcement of victory in Deir al-Zour came just weeks after an American-backed, Kurdish-led militia, called the Syrian Democratic Forces, took over the city of Raqqa, which had served as the de facto capital of the Islamic State.The militants never controlled the whole of the city of Deir al-Zour, although they held most of the surrounding province, an oil-rich region that provided an important source of revenue.For two and a half years, though, the Islamic State had surrounded and besieged 200,000 civilians in the government-held section of the city. Its population dwindled to 90,000, the United Nations estimates, as people escaped or were smuggled out.Now, the group’s most important territory is the border town of Bukamal and the border crossing on the Syrian side. Iraqi forces claimed the other side of the border on Friday, along with most of Qaim, Bukamal’s counterpart on the Iraqi side.That battle for the remaining Islamic State territory could inflame tensions among the competing forces fighting the militants as they converge on the region: the Russian and Iranian-backed alliance that supports the Syrian government; the rival American-backed group, Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F.; and the Iraqi forces that are pursuing Islamic State holdouts on their side of the border.The stakes are high, with the competing armies seeking not only to vanquish the Islamic State, but also racing against each other to win influence in the strategic border zone.Russia, which wants the Syrian government to reclaim all of its territory, and the United States, which wants to counter Iranian influence, have accused each other of firing at their respective allies on the ground.The S.D.F., a Kurdish and Arab alliance, wants to seize as much territory as possible, including oil fields. Those resources and points of leverage could increase its chances of staving off a government takeover of the areas it holds, including Raqqa and the areas to the northeast where Kurds have carved out a measure of autonomy.Iran wants the friendly Syrian government to control the area. With Iraq already a strong ally, Iran could establish a land route linking it with Lebanon, the base of its most powerful allied militia in the region, Hezbollah.Once the Islamic State is driven out, cities like Raqqa may be the next front. A top Iranian official said Friday that the Syrian government and its allies would soon take Raqqa from the American-backed S.D.F.According to IRNA, Iran’s semiofficial news agency, Ali Akbar Velayati, a foreign affairs adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, said that Raqqa and its surroundings “will be liberated” and the Syrian government would take control. “The U.S. is planning to partition Syria,” the agency quoted him as saying. “It will never achieve anything in the field.”The battle on the Iraqi side of the Iraqi-Syrian border on Friday involved Iraq’s elite counterterrorism units, the Iraqi army, the federal police and Iraqi paramilitaries supported by Iran. American military advisers have been working with the Iraqi army and special forces, and the United States provided air support to the Iraqi ground forces on Friday, according to Gen. Yihya Rasool, the spokesman of the Iraqi joint operations command.The Iraqi chief of staff said the Iraqis’ advance gave them and their American-led coalition allies a forward operating position to monitor any remaining Islamic State fighters fleeing the converging armies.An Iraqi Sunni tribal leader whose members also took part in the fighting said that the Islamic State’s foreign fighters had fled Qaim before the final push by the Iraqi forces on Friday. The leader, Sheikh Qutri al-Ubaidi, said that the majority moved their families across the Syrian border in the direction of Bukamal.Sheikh Ubaidi said several Islamic State fighters remained in Iraqi territory, hidden along the banks of the Euphrates River that flows between the two countries. Several Islamic State supporters also fled Qaim in boats across the river toward Rumana, Iraq, he said.As of Friday night, at least two Iraqi towns — Rumana, northwest of Qaim, and Rawa, to the east — were still under Islamic State control.The news from Deir al-Zour cheered some of the tens of thousands of its residents who are displaced across Syria and the region, though, as with Raqqa, it did not mean they could go home any time soon, given the intense destruction and the danger of land mines and Islamic State sleeper cells that may remain there.“We fled from the intensive bombings because we could not stay there any more,” said Alia Mohamed, 33, at a park in Damascus where she watched her 4-year-old daughter — one of her six children — run around as her husband tried to find a room for the family.At a school shelter in Qudsaya, a suburb northwest of Damascus, Hosna Quray’a, who said that she had been displaced for two years, greeted the news with “great joy.”“I want to return,” she said. “Most of my relatives left there, and I don’t know what happened to them.”Ibrahim Haj Hussein, a 14-year-old from the government-controlled part of Deir al-Zour, traveled to the shelter eight months ago because his mother was sick. He left his father behind. The price of food was so high that his family had subsisted on a diet of bulgur wheat and rice, he said, adding, “The situation there was really tough.”', 'Lebanon’s Vanishing Prime Minister Is Back at Work. Now What? - The New York TimesBEIRUT, Lebanon — After a bizarre three-week international sojourn during which he shocked his country by suddenly quitting the government, Saad Hariri, the prime minister of Lebanon, is back home and still in his job — at least for the time being.But while his return and the promise of political dialogue about the country’s future have temporarily pulled Lebanon back from the brink of a political void, the issues that set off the crisis remain as serious and intractable as they were before he left.This small country remains a battleground in the struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran for influence in the Middle East. It is also home to Hezbollah, the militant group that has grown into a regional force in its own right.Although Mr. Hariri has denied it, Lebanese politicians and foreign diplomats say that Saudi Arabia forced him to resign — and even considered replacing him with his brother — in the hope of inciting a change in the status quo that would weaken Hezbollah.That plan failed, in part because Saudi Arabia’s Western allies say they were caught off guard and pressured the Saudis to back down.Now Mr. Hariri is at home once again — and everyone is trying to figure out what comes next.“Where do we go from here?” said Nadim Munla, senior adviser to Mr. Hariri. “Everybody is monitoring Iran and Hezbollah, and I really believe that the ball is in their court.”Mr. Hariri’s strange trip underlines how vulnerable Lebanon remains to clashing regional and international agendas. In the country’s sect-based political system, most major parties rely on foreign powers for funding, with the expectation that the parties will then advance the interests of their international backers.Mr. Hariri has played that role for Saudi Arabia since taking it over from his father, Rafik Hariri, a former prime minister who was killed in a car-bomb attack in Beirut in 2005. Countries like the United States and France also support him, considering him a moderate, pro-Western leader.Hezbollah plays that role for Iran, which helped create it in the 1980s. Iran now relies on the militant group as a strategic threat against Israel and as an expeditionary military force in the Arab world, including in Syria.Besides their divergent views on Lebanon’s role in the world, there is bad blood between Mr. Hariri and Hezbollah.Mr. Hariri has criticized Hezbollah’s intervention in Syria, and some of its members have been indicted for involvement in his father’s killing. Hezbollah says it played no role.But a deal last year brought them together in a power-sharing government, with Mr. Hariri as prime minister and a Christian ally of Hezbollah, Michel Aoun, as president.That arrangement worked domestically. But as Saudi Arabia and its young, assertive crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, grew more alarmed about the activities of Iran and its allies in the region, they found it increasingly untenable that their Lebanese ally was heading a government with members of a group they consider a terrorist organization and security threat.Their pique came to a head on Nov. 4, when Mr. Hariri was summoned to Riyadh and forced to resign, according to foreign diplomats and politicians close to him. Hours later, Saudi officials said they had shot down a missile fired from Yemen as it neared the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Saudi officials blamed Hezbollah for helping Yemeni rebels, and Thamer Sabhan, the Saudi minister for Gulf affairs, accused Iran and Hezbollah of “an act of war” against Saudi Arabia.It remains unclear what the Saudis expected to happen next, but they had at least entertained the idea of replacing Mr. Hariri with his older brother, Bahaa, believing that he would take a harder line on Iran, according to foreign diplomats and Lebanese politicians.“It was part of saying that Hariri is not ready to do this, so let’s find someone who can,” said Alain Aoun, a member of Parliament from the president’s party.But the plan backfired, with politicians across the political spectrum and other members of Mr. Hariri’s family rejecting the idea that Saudi Arabia could swap out politicians as it pleased.“We are not herds of sheep, nor a plot of land whose ownership can be moved from one person to another,” Nouhad Machnouk, the interior minister and an ally of Mr. Hariri, told reporters this month.“In Lebanon, things happen though elections, not pledges of allegiances,” he said, in a jab at Saudi Arabia’s monarchical system.Western countries like the United States and France have worked to keep Lebanon stable, in part because it has taken in more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees, giving it the highest refugee count per capita of any country in the world.The Saudis had not informed their Western allies of their plans for Mr. Hariri, and officials in Paris and Washington were horrified when he announced his resignation.When Mr. Sabhan, the Saudi minister, arrived in Washington a few days later, officials at the State Department berated him for pushing a rash act they felt could destabilize Lebanon, American officials said.France intervened as well. President Emmanuel Macron invited Mr. Hariri to Paris and repeatedly called the Saudis to press them to let him leave.After stops in France, Egypt and Cyprus, Mr. Hariri landed in Beirut on Tuesday to a hero’s welcome. The next day, during a celebration of Lebanon’s Independence Day, he announced that he was holding off on his resignation to allow for dialogue with other political leaders.Any dialogue will have to address Hezbollah’s activities abroad, an issue that Lebanese politicians have avoided because they know they have little leverage over a military force much more powerful than the national army.Mr. Aoun, the member of Parliament, said that Mr. Hariri had returned stronger than before, thanks to an outpouring of support from Lebanon and its foreign allies.“He is coming back with a great opportunity,” Mr. Aoun said. “No one sees him as responsible for what happened. They see him as a victim of what happened.”He said that he expected the dialogue to focus on the idea that Lebanon should stay out of conflicts in the region. Hezbollah has flouted that by sending fighters and advisers to Syria, Iraq and Yemen.But the breadth of Hezbollah’s activities has lead many to conclude that addressing them is not Lebanon’s responsibility alone.“It is not through a Lebanese dialogue that we can address these issues,” Mr. Aoun said. “They need to be discussed internationally.”And the parties’ foreign backers may not give them much room to negotiate.In an interview published on Friday, Prince Mohammed of Saudi Arabia compared Iran’s supreme leader to Hitler and said that Mr. Hariri could not provide political cover for a government that the Saudis consider to be controlled by Hezbollah.The day before, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Mohammad Ali Jafari, stood up for Hezbollah, saying that it should have the best weapons to protect Lebanon.“This issue is nonnegotiable,” he said.Mr. Munla, Mr. Hariri’s adviser, said the coming negotiations would need to address Hezbollah’s regional role, but that it was unclear whether it or its Iranian patrons would be willing to give that up.“Given what we are hearing from them, one would wonder if they are willing to compromise,” he said.', 'Promise the Moon? Easy for Trump. But Now Comes the Reckoning. - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump leaves little doubt about what he thinks of his predecessor’s top domestic and international legacies. The health care program enacted by President Barack Obama is “outrageous” and “absolutely destroying everything in its wake.” The nuclear deal with Iran is “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.”Yet as much as he has set his sights on them, Mr. Trump after nearly nine months in office has not actually gotten rid of either. Instead, in the past few days, he took partial steps to undercut both initiatives and then left it to Congress to figure out what to do next. Whether either will ultimately survive in some form has become a central suspense of Mr. Trump’s first year in office.In the case of health care, Mr. Trump is making a virtue of necessity. Having failed to push through legislation replacing the Affordable Care Act, he is taking more limited measures on his own authority aimed at chipping away at the law. On the other hand, when it comes to the Iran deal, he has the authority to walk away without anyone else’s consent but has been talked out of going that far by his national security team. Instead, by refusing to recertify the deal, he rhetorically disavows the pact without directly pulling out.These are not the only instances in which Mr. Trump’s expansive language has not been matched by his actions during this opening phase of his presidency. On immigration, diplomatic relations with Cuba and international accords like the North American Free Trade Agreement and a separate trade pact with South Korea, he has denounced decisions made by Mr. Obama or other previous presidents without fully reversing them.“Presidential campaigns are won with big, simple, directional promises that rarely align well with the complexity confronted in the Oval Office,” said Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican former governor of Utah and secretary of health and human services who advised Mr. Trump’s transition team. “So presidents do the best they can to stretch the fabric of incomplete outcomes to cover as much bare backside as possible and move on.”Mr. Trump’s advisers characterize that as the more pragmatic side of a businessman who takes maximalist positions in part to set the stage for negotiations but does not necessarily intend to go as far as he might give the impression. His critics said that the partial steps were still destructive, and that the president was effectively leaving initiatives like health care and the Iran deal wounded on the battlefield without allowing ambulances onto the scene.A question for the president is whether partial actions will satisfy supporters demanding a full repudiation of the Obama era. Mr. Trump promised to deal with such issues in some cases within his first days in office but has found that Washington resists quick action. Frustrated by Congress, he is increasingly turning to executive power and can point to the moves he has made as signs of his commitment to fulfilling his promises.“The gap between President Trump’s ambitious promises and actual policies is large and growing,” said William C. Inboden, a White House aide under President George W. Bush and now executive director of the William P. Clements Jr. Center on History, Strategy and Statecraft at the University of Texas. “This is weakening the institution of the presidency itself, which becomes diminished when presidents over promise and under deliver, or when responsibilities normally handled by the president become habitually shirked to Congress or other nations.”A cautionary tale is Mr. Obama himself, who made lofty and ambitious heal-the-planet, close-Guantánamo promises only to fall short in some instances, to the disappointment of his liberal supporters. The difference is that Mr. Trump often gives the impression with his public comments that he has gone further than he actually has.“It’s classic Trump: bluff and bombast substituting for actual deeds,” said Jacob Heilbrunn, editor of The National Interest, a foreign policy magazine. “He’s the political equivalent of the Washington Nationals — a choke artist at critical moments.”Mr. Trump pronounced himself happy with the approach he is taking on health care, which has been the most consuming domestic issue of his presidency so far. “We’re going a little different route,” he told an audience of religious conservatives on Friday. “But you know what? In the end, it’s going to be just as effective, and maybe it’ll even be better.”Later in the day, he acknowledged that his new strategy on Iran would not actually scrap the nuclear deal but would allow Congress to come up with an alternative. Asked why he did not simply terminate the agreement, he said: “I may very well do that. But I like a two-step process much better.”Democrats said Mr. Trump’s actions were meant to sabotage the health care program and undermine the Iran deal even without full repeal. By cutting subsidies to insurance companies, “it’s clear the president is trying to sabotage the health care market and send costs soaring,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland denounced what he called “the president’s reckless, political decision and his subsequent threat to Congress” on the Iran agreement.Mr. Trump has taken partial steps on other campaign promises as well. He signed an order scrapping his predecessor’s program granting legal status to as many as 800,000 younger immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children, but delayed the final effect for six months to give Congress a chance to restore it on a more solid legal foundation. Even then, he suggested that he would find another way to preserve the program if Congress did not meet his deadline.He has boasted that he was reversing Mr. Obama’s diplomatic opening to Cuba. But while he has pulled out many diplomats and restored some restrictions on contacts with the island, he has not cut off relations again, closed the embassy or shut down travel and other interactions. He has talked about throwing out Nafta, but has actually left it intact and has taken the route of negotiating to see if it can be retained with improved provisions.“I am not surprised because Donald Trump is not an ideologue, he’s a realist and a pragmatist,” said Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of the president’s. “During the campaign, he staked out some very strong positions maybe as a negotiating start point, or in other cases they were based on the facts he had at the time.”“Trump is actually very open to feedback and criticism on his ideas,” Mr. Ruddy said. “Based on that he can easily adjust and change course.”Clifford Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, said the president seemed to be trying to translate business negotiations to the political world. “Trump’s clearly got a theory of deal-making — demand the world, take the most you can, and then brag about it,” he said. “It’s actually a pretty good tack that’s often underestimated. But the bottom line, so far in his presidency, is that he’s been unable to deliver on overstated goals.”In the end, he may wind up taking the more sweeping actions — he may yet pull the United States out of Nafta or the Iran deal. He may yet let the program for younger immigrants expire early next year. He has repeatedly talked about “letting Obamacare fail,” which his latest steps may accelerate.“There is now a new and scary spring in his step,” Mr. Kupchan said. “He could be entering a new phase involving fuller takedowns of agreements and institutions. The Iran deal and Nafta are bellwether cases. What’s really interesting is that he fired his chief revolutionary, Steve Bannon, but seems on the verge of taking on that role himself.”', '                                    President Donald Trump speaks about Iran from the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House in Washington, Friday, Oct. 13, 2017.                                                                            (Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)                                                                    The Trump Show continues to monopolize our national stage. This past week, Bob Corker, a sitting U.S. Senator, called the White House a home for an addled geriatric, and accused the president of castrating Rex Tillerson, his Secretary of State. Meanwhile, Steve Bannon, Trump’s campaign guru and former senior White House advisor, bet against Trump finishing out his first term, as the head of Breitbart fixed his gaze on the Twenty Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Over in the realm of policy, Trump declared war on ObamaCare, the Iran Deal, the First Amendment and UNESCO. As long as Trump occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, don’t expect this tumultuous cacophony to disappear. It is America’s new normal.Enter “One Nation After Trump: A Guide for the Perplexed, the Disillusioned, the Desperate, and the Not-Yet Deported,” a 352-page prayer and how-to book, written by three members of the D.C. establishment, E.J. Dionne of the Washington Post, Norman Ornstein of the Brookings Institute, and Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institute. “One Nation After Trump” offers a sincere and detailed blueprint for a neo-liberal restoration. And that is its problem. The book fails to adequately internalize the rage that in 2016 overturned America’s post-Reagan status quo. Beyond that, the authors seemingly fail to recognize that politics is transactional, and lack a message and offering powerful enough to lure Obama-Trump voters back to the Democratic column. Most of all, there is an empathy shortage for those who find themselves outside of the Democrats’ current upstairs-downstairs coalition.As Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and former advisor to President Bill Clinton, trenchantly framed things, “If the life expectancy of, say, Somali immigrants in Minnesota suddenly took a dive, Democrats would be falling all over each other trying to ascertain the causes and advocate the cures. We owe white working-class Americans no less.”The book fails to adequately internalize the rage that in 2016 overturned America’s post-Reagan status quo. Yet, “One Nation” does not come close, even as it awkwardly tries. The book contains a detailed discussion of America’s changing demographics, its historic high levels of immigration, and the resulting friction and resentment. A significant portion of Trump voters feels like strangers in their house, and “One Nation” does not satisfactorily address that disconnect. Rather, its authors seems intent on pushing ahead with a prescription of open borders and multiculturalism, the same recipe that made Trump a reality. This approach may sound like sweet music to the chattering class, but is unlikely to impress those voters who cast a ballot for Barack Obama in 2008 or 2012 and then for Donald Trump a year ago.The glaring realities are also that at the end of the day 700,000 white employees lost their jobs as the result of the Great Recession, that white life expectancy outside the reach of high-end America has declined, and that with the exceptions of Maine and Vermont military service is the domain of Red America. As Andrew Sullivan observed in New York Magazine, in recent years the number of deaths attributable to drug overdoses exceeds the annual death rate from AIDS. However, no one is wearing ribbons. The powder that exploded last November was all around.At the same time, polling from Gallup had reflected a pre-election groundswell in Americans’ self-identification as working class. At the turn of the century, only one-third of Americans identified themselves as such. Yet by 2015, the figure had risen to nearly one-half. Fortunately, the number of Americans who see themselves as working class has since receded to pre-recession levels, with only 36 percent calling themselves working class as of June 2017. As the scholar, Barrington Moore Jr., said, “No bourgeoisie, no democracy.”“One Nation” is on more solid ground in identifying the threat that the Trump presidency represents to American norms and institutions. Hardly a day goes by without Trump taking aim at both. An independent judiciary, a functioning diplomatic corps, and a free press have all been Trump targets. Yet, Trump’s core supporters are either undisturbed or are actively rooting for their guy. Clearly, “modern” presidential has more than a few followers.Against this backdrop, it looks like Dionne, Ornstein, and Mann, “One Nation’s” authors, have a lot of persuading to do. Whether they are simply preaching to the choir, or leave a real mark remains to be seen.Lloyd Green is the managing member of Ospreylytics, LLC, a research and analytics firm, was staff secretary to George H.W.

Most people walked straight past it, a festering eyesore in a city dominated by high rises and building cranes.But when Hamidreza Pejman, a sweatpants-wearing art lover with a mission to bring Iranian art to a global level, stumbled across the building he saw something else: a space to exhibit international art and build bridges between Iranian and foreign artists. “A place where art can be art,” he said, “no matter the costs.”Mr. Pejman, 36, who once scrubbed toilets in London but got rich in construction in Iran, took out his checkbook and bought the brewery last year.In the two years that his nonprofit Pejman Foundation has been active, he has not only bought loads of Iranian art, but also supported dozens of Iranian and foreign artists.In fact, he says his love of art has become so pricey that he has been forced to cut back on other things. “I had to move in with my parents three months ago to save costs. I’m selling my Porsche,” he said, adding: “My goal is not to make any money from art. My goal is to free our art scene from the iron grip of money and get as many people to interact with art as possible.”Instead of tearing the brewery down, the norm in Tehran with buildings more than 30 years old, he underwrote a restoration that preserved its industrial character. He called it the Argo Factory, not for the Hollywood movie on the Iranian hostage crisis but for the beer once produced there.“For too long we have erased our history in Iran,” he said, standing in the building’s cavernous boiler room, now part of the exhibition space. “We shouldn’t tear down our buildings.”When he first entered the building, it was filled with bottles, labels and receipts, proof that before the Islamic revolution alcohol consumption was common in Iran. “I’ve kept everything, such things are also a part of who we are.”The Argo Factory, which opened in February, was an instant success. There is no entrance fee, and the works are not for sale. Art students flock there from across Iran, along with tourists and a variety of other Iranians. The first exhibition featured a French-Algerian artist, Neil Beloufa, who produces films and installations. Mr. Pejman invited the artist and his crew to Tehran, and they in turn interacted with Iranian artists to create the exhibition.The work will go on display in Paris in 2018. “But here in Iran people will already have seen it,” Mr. Pejman said. “Instead of the artists being hijacked by the art mafia, I want to give young artists a chance to grow and interact with artists from other countries.”Iran’s censors, who are much less active than in the past, have so far ignored the Argo Factory. “We are much more free in Iran’s art scene compared to the past and finding the courage to do much more,” Mr. Pejman said.In fact, Iran’s art scene has long been vibrant, with artists and galleries providing space for social criticism in a country where political discussion is largely muted. There are nearly 100 galleries in Tehran alone, with dozens of exhibition openings every week. The capital is also home to a huge contemporary art museum, dating from before the 1979 Islamic revolution.But Iran’s isolation, which is in some ways conducive to fine art, has also distorted the art market. Under Western sanctions imposed over Iran’s nuclear program, Iranian investors were prevented from sending cash abroad. They began to speculate in art, often as a way to launder cash obtained in sanctions-evading schemes.At flashy Tehran art auctions, works by local artists were suddenly selling for previously unheard-of sums, often equivalent to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many artists, chasing the money, started catering to the wishes of their galleries and buyers, producing salable, decorative works.“It had become a vicious circle,” said Mr. Pejman, who acknowledges having been one of those speculators. “Collecting art became like collecting cars for rich people. What would you do if you were a young artist? You start catering to them.”Perhaps Mr. Pejman’s affinity for young struggling artists arose because he struggled himself at an early age. In many ways, he was lucky to turn 17 in 1997, the year that a reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, came to power.Mr. Pejman was accepted at Soureh Art University at a time now described by many as a political spring. Professors barred from teaching elsewhere for political reasons would combine subjects like sociology and philosophy with the art classes. “The seeds of my love for art were sown there,” he said.In 2006 he moved to London to study fashion design and found himself without friends and largely unable to speak the language. To make ends meet he took any work he could, which mostly meant menial jobs like cleaning toilets and washing dishes. “Whenever I had nothing to do, I would go to the Tate Modern or visit other museums,” he said. “I was so alone. But I did see some of the best art in the world.”Back in Iran, over a year later, his uncle who was moving to Canada asked him to safeguard his ailing construction company. Mr. Pejman, only 26 at the time, found a Chinese client and struck it rich.Like many Iranians who have found themselves awash in money, Mr. Pejman immediately bought a fancy car. But that did not give him the satisfaction he expected. “I didn’t feel good at all driving it,” he said. “That was when I found out that I don’t care for luxury or brands. I got into art, which had always attracted me.”On a sunny afternoon in the courtyard of the brewery, young men and women sipping macchiatos and discussing the exhibition sat next to a colorful fiberglass statue of a renowned cleric riding backward on a donkey. The work was inspired by the story of Mollah Nasreddin, a folk hero across the Middle East who is often the butt of jokes. The statue was mounted on a spring like a child’s playground toy, and some of them climbed aboard.Mr. Pejman, talking and explaining the meaning of the work to whoever wanted to listen, was in his element. Argo, he told his visitors, will grow to become a center of contemporary art in Iran, and will help Iranian artists to grow and become on par with artists abroad.“I am a straightforward person. I want to build something that lasts,” Mr. Pejman said. “If I could choose, I would rather be Mozart in death than Warren Buffett while living.”', 'PARIS – France\'s Foreign Ministry said a Saudi-led coalition has "extracted" two French female journalists from war-torn Yemen.Ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne said Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian discussed how to bring them back safely to Riyadh during his visit to Saudi Arabia on Thursday.The journalists are freelancers working for Paris Match magazine. She said they were back in France on Friday. She couldn\'t provide details on what happened during their reporting trip to Yemen, where they spent about two weeks.Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television reported Thursday the journalists had gone missing in an area of Yemen held by the Iran-aligned Houthi group.', 'Can Trump Bring Peace to the Middle East? - The New York TimesWhile President Trump has followed in few of his predecessors’ footsteps, his administration has done the expected in at least one respect: It has undertaken a Middle East peace initiative in its first year. Most recent administrations have done the same, and all have failed. Will Mr. Trump do any better?The specifics of the initiative are still being hammered out, but some elements are clear. Most administrations start with modest proposals to build trust between the parties and then, when these efforts have bred mutual suspicion and disappointment, they propose a framework for an agreement just as the process moves toward collapse. Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, the chief negotiator, have done the reverse, hinting that Washington will lay down the principles of an agreement at the outset of talks, but without imposing them on either party.A two-state solution might not be in the cards. While talks toward a plan move forward, the administration will undertake a series of confidence-building measures; these might include a Palestinian pledge to resume security cooperation with Israel in return for the transfer of a bit of land to the Palestinian Authority, a limited settlement freeze and economic aid for West Bank Palestinians. This is standard fare.Mr. Trump will also try to regionalize the process. In exchange for Israeli flexibility, Arab countries in the Sunni coalition — notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — would extend privileges that Israel has long coveted, including overflight and perhaps some sort of diplomatic status, and offer lavish funding to prop up the Palestinian entity that signs an agreement with Israel. The Obama administration attempted to elicit Saudi involvement, too, but King Abdullah rejected its proposal. As the process evolves, the particulars of these canonical provisions will change as well.In addition, on Wednesday Mr. Trump conferred American recognition on Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and announced that the Embassy will be moved to Jerusalem. He did not, however, define what he meant by “Jerusalem,” only defining it as an Israeli capital whose boundaries have yet to be negotiated with Palestinians. It is therefore unclear what precisely has been formally recognized.It is possible that Mr. Trump is attempting to lure Israel into concessions through this policy departure and maybe even trap Mr. Netanyahu into responding in kind. But the emptiness of the gesture suggests otherwise. One thing that the announcement will have done is to shore up the president’s evangelical base, who won’t inquire too closely into the practical import of the announcement but will be seduced by the headlines it generates.The Trump administration seems to believe that after a half-century of failed peace initiatives, the stars have finally aligned. And it’s not entirely wrong.Israel and Saudi Arabia, for example, have forged a cooperative relationship that could provide Arab cover for a deal on Israeli terms. Indeed, there are unconfirmed rumors that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has told the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, to agree to an Israeli offer or resign. By isolating the Palestinians, Saudi cover would work in the same way that Egyptian cover enabled Menachem Begin to deflect Jimmy Carter’s push for Palestinian autonomy at Camp David.Bill Clinton’s prioritization of an Israel-Syria agreement was meant to weaken Mr. Abbas’s predecessor, Yasir Arafat, who lamented his reduced position by labeling himself “the other woman.” Egypt and Israel, moreover, can now exert pressure on Hamas to pursue reconciliation with West Bank moderates, that way disarming — in theory — Gaza-based rejectionists.Furthermore, Washington’s assertive stance toward Iran has long been urged by Israel, which has hinted now and then that American pressure on Iran might prompt Israeli concessions to Palestinians. So there might be an opening for a quid pro quo. And, the thinking goes, if Richard Nixon’s anti-Communist credentials gave him the credibility to stage an opening to China, President Trump’s pro-Israeli, pro-Saudi and anti-Iranian positions might enable him to persuade Israel to consider serious compromise.Finally, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is in serious political trouble, and should he fall, his successor might adopt a more flexible attitude.This is a superficially impressive case, but the whole is far less than the sum of its parts. First, the Saudis are unlikely to pay Israel for something they already get free. The Israeli Foreign Ministry, for example, has already instructed its diplomats to lobby on behalf of Saudi Arabia’s tough talk on Lebanon. Israel will encourage an aggressive American stance toward Iran whether or not the Saudis take a tough line with Palestinian leaders.Second, Hamas will not play dead just because it is under pressure to proceed with reconciliation. And the moderates lack the capacity to govern Gaza, in any case. Their latest waltz is unlikely to culminate in betrothal.Third, an American crackdown on Iran is unlikely to yield Israeli accommodation of Palestinian goals. Quite the opposite: Israeli leaders believe that if they can prevail on Mr. Trump on confronting Iran, they can win on the peace process, too. And if Mr. Netanyahu does fall, there is scant evidence that his successor will be more open to concessions to the Palestinians.The larger point is that successive peace process efforts have failed not because of avoidable misunderstandings, inept negotiating tactics, diplomatic blunders or bad luck. They have failed because neither side wants an agreement on anything like the other side’s terms. (And this is all separate from Mr. Trump’s unfocused volatility, not to mention his ill-timed plan to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Such recognition limited to West Jerusalem might make sense to clinch Israel’s buy-in at the endgame of a negotiation, but not at the very outset, when an ill-defined pledge will antagonize Palestinians and most likely inflame the Arab world.)The obstacles are structural. On the whole, Israeli voters are more right-wing, more religious, less well educated and more mistrustful of Arabs than they were in the past. The Orthodox Jewish population on the West Bank is growing rapidly, twice as fast as the Palestinian population. Sophisticated surveys also show that Israelis are generally happy with their lives; they will not welcome disruption.Israel remains much more powerful than the Palestinians and in firm control of Palestinian territories. Accordingly, many Israelis do not perceive a need to give up the West Bank, divide Jerusalem or accept the security risks implied by withdrawal because they regard such concessions as both morally wrong and practically unnecessary. Mr. Netanyahu is reported to believe that liberal American Jews will disappear in the next generation or two and that evangelicals and Orthodox Jews will be strong enough to immunize Israel against American pressure. Israel, in other words, is willing to wait it out.On the other side, many Palestinians have discarded the idea of a Palestinian state. The alternatives they have are the status quo, the forlorn hope for Israeli citizenship or, for those with the energy and resources, emigration to Jordan and then, maybe, to the wider Arab world. Europe and the United States are no longer welcoming destinations. Political violence is also an option.Last, a successful peace effort would require the president to lean heavily on Israel, rope in Arab states as deep-pocketed honest brokers and collaborate with leaders on both sides who can deliver in the face of strong — even violent — domestic opposition. There is no such Israeli leadership on the horizon, nor is there any on the Palestinian side as Mr. Abbas prepares his exit.Nor is American pressure in the cards. For all the talk from successive administrations, a Palestinian-Israeli peace has never been a strategic imperative for Washington. Thus, no administration has been willing to incur the domestic political costs entailed by an imposed agreement along the lines the Trump administration has already disavowed. When strategic interests do come into play, the United States has consistently pursued its own interest, as when it blocked Israeli aircraft from Iraqi airspace during Desert Storm or refused to strike Iran in 2012.There is no reason to believe that the Trump administration is insincere in its pursuit of an agreement. But against the deeper structures underlying the surface reality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is highly unlikely that Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt will make much of a dent.', "IRBIL, Iraq – Iraq's military is preparing to take control of the international borders of the northern Kurdish region.The preparations are part of the central government's stepped-up efforts to isolate the Kurds following their vote on independence earlier this week.They come a day after Iraq instituted a flight ban that halted all international flights from servicing the territory's airports.Iraqi troops now in Turkey and Iran were expected to start enforcing control over the border crossings out of the Kurdish region Saturday morning.", '', "TEHRAN, Iran – A member of Tehran city council has said that more than 20,000 Tehran residents die annually from air pollution.A Sunday report by the semi-official ILNA news agency quotes Majid Farahani as saying that the figure has more than doubled since 2005.Over the past few years, air pollution has on several occasions compelled Iranian authorities to close all schools and offices in the capital city.Authorities have tried to reduce the city's air pollution by limiting the number of vehicles, blaming it on millions of old-fashioned motorbikes and cars stuck in prolonged traffic jams.", "                                    Iranian President Hassan Rouhani defends his proposed ministers of energy and science in an open session of parliament in Tehran, Iran, Sunday, Oct. 29, 2017.

", 'BEIRUT – Prime Minister Saad Hariri\'s older brother broke his silence Wednesday over the premier\'s mysterious resignation, saying he supports his brother\'s decision to step down over the growing demands and actions of Hezbollah.In his first public statement, Bahaa Hariri blasted Iran and its militant Lebanese proxy.In a statement from Bahaa Hariri\'s office sent to The Associated Press, he accuses Hezbollah of seeking "to take control of Lebanon." He also expressed gratitude to Saudi Arabia for "decades of support" for Lebanon\'s national institutions.Bahaa Hariri\'s name has been mentioned in Lebanese media reports as a possible Saudi-backed candidate to replace his brother, who announced his resignation from the Saudi capital on Nov. 4.In a follow-up phone call from Monaco with the AP Wednesday, Bahaa Hariri declined to comment further.Saad Hariri, who headed a year-old coalition government that included Hezbollah, cited Iran and Hezbollah\'s meddling in the region for his decision to step down. He has not returned to Lebanon since, and the Lebanese president has refused to accept his resignation before he returns to the country to explain the circumstances of his decision.Top Lebanese officials believe Saudi Arabia forced the resignation on Hariri, a dual Lebanese-Saudi national, and is holding him in the kingdom against his will."I support my brother Saad\'s decision to resign as prime minister of Lebanon in the face of the growing demands and actions of Hezbollah, Iran\'s surrogate party, in Lebanon," the statement by Bahaa Hariri said.It said the Hariri family has always stood for the principles that make Lebanon unique in the world, including its mosaic of different confessions and political backgrounds."Only a pernicious outside actor, such as Iran and its surrogate, Hezbollah, can upset the balance as this group now seeks to take control of Lebanon."Lebanese media reported last week that the kingdom had decided to replace Hariri, whom it has come to perceive as too lenient with Hezbollah, with his older brother as its new man in Lebanon.Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk, a member of Hariri\'s Future Movement and a close aide, dismissed the reports. "We are not a herd of sheep or a piece of property whose ownership can be handed over from one person to the other," he told reporters.Bahaa Hariri, 51, worked in his family\'s construction and development company, Saudi Oger, in Saudi Arabia. He then split, and now runs his own real estate and investment businesses. He rarely makes comments to the press.In April 2005, two months after their father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, was assassinated in a Beirut bombing, the family announced that Saad would assume his father\'s political mantle, skipping over his brother, Bahaa, who is several years his senior.The relationship between the two Hariri brothers is reportedly tense.', 'On Eve of Kurdish Independence Vote, a Warning From Turkey - The New York TimesERBIL, Iraq — Kurds seeking independence from Iraq came under intense pressure on Saturday from their powerful neighbor, Turkey, which demanded that Iraqi Kurdistan cancel an independence vote scheduled for Monday.Turkey, the main link to the outside world for the autonomous Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq, threatened economic and diplomatic retaliation if Kurds carried out a referendum that the Turkish government called a “terrible mistake.”Turkey’s Parliament voted late Saturday to renew for one year a mandate to authorize military intervention in Iraq or Syria if Turkey determines that developments there threaten national security. Turkey, a NATO member, is conducting tank exercises on its border with Iraqi Kurdistan.Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, asked by reporters in Ankara, the capital, whether a cross-border incursion was possible, replied that security operations were “a question of timing” based on “developing conditions.”Iraq’s Kurds refused to back down. The Kurdish region’s president, Massoud Barzani, said the independence vote would proceed as scheduled despite threats from Turkey as well as Iran.“It’s too late to talk about delaying the referendum,” Mr. Barzani said in a statement released by his office in Erbil on Saturday.“It’s not my decision anymore, he added. “It’s a decision for the people.”In a defiant speech on Friday evening to 40,000 Kurds in Erbil chanting “Bye-bye Iraq,” Mr. Barzani said of Turkey and Iran: “You have punished us for one hundred years. Are you not tired yet?”Both Turkey and Iran fear that an independence move by Iraqi Kurds could set off unrest among their own Kurdish minorities.Baghdad considers the vote illegal and unconstitutional, and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq has said his government is prepared to use military force if the referendum provokes violence. A delegation of Kurdish leaders traveled to Baghdad on Saturday to discuss the referendum with Iraqi officials.Ali al-Alaq, a member of Iraq’s Parliament who has led talks with the Kurds, said in an interview that the discussions would continue over the weekend. But he said negotiations would end if the vote were conducted on Monday.Kurdish officials said voting had already begun Saturday among Iraqi Kurdish expatriates in Germany, Denmark, Britain and Switzerland. Some waved the Kurdistan flag.The United States and most of the international community have opposed the referendum, saying it could unleash ethnic conflict, break up Iraq and undermine the American-led campaign against Islamic State militants.Iran, the Kurdish region’s eastern neighbor, has threatened border closures, prompting some Kurds to stockpile food and supplies.Kurdish officials in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan’s capital, said they were continuing to talk on Saturday with American officials. The Kurdistan Regional Government has said it would scrap the referendum only if the United States provided an ironclad guarantee of a path to independence within a specified time.The United States has urged Kurds to cancel the vote and begin negotiations with Baghdad, facilitated by Washington. Kurdish leaders say they want a public mandate from the Kurdish people before negotiating independence.After the Americans established a no-fly zone in 1991 that protected Kurdish areas from attacks by Saddam Hussein’s troops, the Kurds have carved out an autonomous region with its own government, parliament and military. Kurdish fighters known as the pesh merga have played a central role, alongside Iraqi troops, in operations against the Islamic State.The referendum would not lead directly to independence, but a strong “yes” vote would strengthen the Kurdish position in any negotiations with Baghdad. Rozh Nouri Shaways, leader of the Kurdish delegation in Baghdad, told reporters that Kurdistan was willing to negotiate with Iraq before and after the referendum.Baghdad and Iraqi Kurdistan are locked in a longstanding dispute over contested areas, including oil-rich Kirkuk, seized by Kurdish fighters in 2014. Baghdad fears that the independence vote, which includes citizens of the contested areas, would strengthen Kurdish claims to those territories.The ballot asks voters whether they want Kurdistan and the contested areas to become an independent state.Kirkuk’s provincial governor, Najmaldin Karim, a Kurd, urged residents on Saturday to prepare to vote on Monday. “All the preparations have been made,” Mr. Karim told the Kurdish news agency Rudaw. He called the vote “historical.”On Saturday morning, the police controlled by the Baghdad government withdrew from their posts in the city of Kirkuk and surrounding areas, according to local officials. They said that the police and government-paid school administrators had been directed by Baghdad not to assist with the referendum. Much of the voting is scheduled to take place at schools.Kurdish officials said security officers from the Kurdistan Regional Government took over responsibility Saturday for security in the area.', 'Letters to the Editor - The New York TimesTo the Editor:I take it as a great insult to billions of Christians that the Sept. 10 cover of the Book Review was a cartoon-like caricature depicting Batman, a K.K.K. member in a white hood, a unicorn, Santa Claus, ET and other fantastical and crazy characters all alongside a depiction of Jesus Christ. That the headline was “National Delusions” made it even worse.EDWARD GALORENZO WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J.To the Editor:I read Mary Beard’s review about what Greek myths have to teach us in modern times with interest (Sept. 10). And I agree with her that their biggest lesson might not be the value of rage. How we think about life and death, how we use symbols, and approach what we don’t understand, how we develop our systems of morals and values, are all enhanced by the force of myth.While entertaining, myths can instruct and explain. Stories told in myth, especially when they enliven and charm, have power with deep roots in the real. Myths, both ancient and contemporary, religious and secular, reiterate the beliefs, behaviors, and feelings of people about their world. Imaginary, remote and timeless, mythic tales show the universal aspects of our human condition.DEANIE ROWAN BLANK HAMDEN, CONN.To the Editor:Although my first reaction to the review of Suzy Hansen’s “Notes on a Foreign Country” (Sept. 3), and the book itself, was positive, I found myself becoming increasingly irritated by the depiction of how Americans are seen in the wider world.Right out of college, while the Shah was still in power, I joined the Peace Corps and went to Iran. Most of us went overseas with a certain cynicism about our own country and often talked about American imperialism — and certainly America’s role in putting the Shah back on the throne. Ironically, Iranians, though they had an awareness of this history, had an affection for Americans that was strong and genuine.When I returned to Iran just over two years ago, I was greeted with the same kindness and excitement about the progress being made on the nuclear agreement. The guide who showed us around the crown jewels declared that the two greatest nations in the world are Iran and America. The citizens of a country whose leaders consider us the “Great Satan” seemed to look on us with more affection than Americans themselves.It is true that many Americans have a relentlessly chauvinistic view of their own country, but many, many more are familiar with and embarrassed by its many faults. My experiences certainly taught me that one should not make the mistake of confusing the government with its people.ADRIENNE GORMAN NEW YORK', 'As ISIS Is Driven From Iraq, Sunnis Remain Alienated - The New York TimesKARMAH, Iraq — After the Islamic State was finally driven from the central Iraqi city of Karmah last year, Sirhan Sallom returned to his home to find it demolished.Mr. Sallom, 70, has since waited in vain for help. In Iraq’s deeply sectarian system, he doesn’t expect much from the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad. But he is angry that local and national Sunni politicians haven’t come to the aid of his Sunni Muslim city either.“These politicians are Sunni — they are supposed to help us,” he said. “They’re useless.”Fourteen years after the American invasion ended decades of Sunni dominance in Iraq, Iraq’s Sunni Arabs are struggling to reclaim relevance and influence. After they were ousted from government jobs and from the military by the post-Saddam Hussein government, their powerlessness and rage gave rise to Sunni militant movements like Al Qaeda in Iraq and the Islamic State.Now that those militants are being driven from the Sunni heartland, how the government responds to Sunnis trying to rebuild their lives is likely to have long-term consequences for the country’s stability and security.More than 3.1 million Iraqis, the vast majority Sunni, remain displaced from their homes after three years of occupation and battles with the Islamic State. Another 2.3 million have returned. As towns like Karmah await rebuilding, Sunni leaders have not received much help from a cash-strapped central government more focused on battling the militants and, more recently, the Kurds.Since 2003, Sunnis, who make up about a quarter of the population, have lost out to Shiites and Kurds, who were both brutally repressed by an elite Sunni minority under Saddam Hussein. With Iraq’s government now controlled by Shiites, and the Kurds governing their own autonomous area in the north, the Sunnis are in a political no-man’s land.There were high expectations when Haider al-Abadi became prime minister in 2014 that he could turn the page after the divisive sectarian rule of his predecessor, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, and win the confidence of the Sunnis.Instead, Sunni leaders say, he has forsaken them while forging closer ties with Iran, the hard-line Shiite theocracy next door. Iran now wields tremendous influence over Iraq’s economy, military and government.Hamid al-Mutlaq, who represents Karmah in Parliament, said the government was more focused on working with Iran and Iranian-armed Shiite militias than helping Sunnis rebuild.“We are now a displaced people, a completely marginalized people — and it’s getting worse by the day,” he said.“We have a corrupt government controlled by a foreign power, at the expense of Sunnis,” he added.But Sunni politicians are mired in local feuds. They can hardly advance their own case when they can’t even agree on where to meet to patch up differences. At a Baghdad conference two years ago, Sunni politicians threw chairs at each other as their bodyguards traded punches.“Our politicians do nothing for us,” said Ismail Jassim, 39, who relies on donations from neighbors in Karmah to survive in his home, which was burned by militants. “We never see them, except on TV at election time.”The power of Sunni politicians was greatly diminished by the power-sharing agreement adopted after the American invasion. Under its formula, the prime minister’s post, along with the interior and foreign ministries, are reserved for Shiites. Kurds get the presidency and finance ministry. Sunni Arabs get Parliament speaker and defense minister, but the prime minister is commander in chief, and Shiite army commanders and militia leaders wield significant influence.Iranian-trained Shiite militias are part of Iraq’s armed forces and have battled Islamic State militants since they seized nearly a third of Iraq in 2014. The militias have been accused of atrocities against Sunni civilians, and their presence near Sunni areas has alarmed many residents. A Shiite religious flag fluttered last week at an Iraqi military checkpoint outside Karmah.Kurds have their own army as well, known as the pesh merga. But Sunnis have no national armed force, only tribal militias blended into Iraqi security forces to fight the militants.Some Sunni politicians have advocated an autonomous Sunni region, but those proposals have stalled amid partisan bickering.“Sunnis have no unified leadership,” said Wathiq al-Hashimi, the head of the Iraqi Group for Strategic Studies, an independent research group in Baghdad. “And Sunni politicians seem to care only about narrow personal interests.”A Kurdish referendum on independence last month further divided Sunnis. Most opposed it, preferring to keep Kurds inside Iraq as a counterweight against Shiite domination; virtually all Iraqi Kurds are Sunni. Many Sunnis cheered the government takeover of contested areas, where Sunni Arabs had seethed under Kurdish control.But even Sunnis opposed to the Kurdish vote were alarmed when Iraqi forces conducted military maneuvers with Iranian troops inside Iran along the Iraq border.“We won’t tolerate that kind of foreign interference on top of everything else,” said Sheikh Ahmed al-Karim, a Sunni lawmaker who generally supports the government of Mr. Abadi, the prime minister.In Parliament, the Sunni-led bloc has 78 seats, roughly proportionate to their share of the population, but is dwarfed by the Shiite bloc, with 182. The Kurdish bloc has 65 seats. Parliament has fallen increasingly under the sway of Iran, which is locked in a regional power struggle with Sunni countries led by Saudi Arabia.Mithal al-Alusi, a Sunni lawmaker, has called the government “a cardboard state” because of its ties to Iran. He has asked, acidly, whether Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran’s elite overseas military forces who has advised Iraq’s Shiite militias, had a proper visa to enter Iraq.Shiites seem driven by a sense of religious grievance and a pan-Shiite destiny. Kurds are motivated by nationalism and dreams of independence. And Sunnis?“For the Sunnis, there’s a lack of political cohesion about exactly what they want,” said Maria Fantappie, a senior analyst for Iraq at the International Crisis Group.David L. Phillips, a former adviser at the State Department who has worked on Iraq for 30 years, said Sunnis had failed to organize as effectively as Shiites and Kurds.“Baghdad is perfectly content to see the Sunnis in disarray,” he said.There are a few hopeful signs. Because some Shiite factions will oppose Mr. Abadi in April, and Kurdish politics are in upheaval, he will have to court the Sunni bloc to help ensure re-election.“The Abadi government has never needed the Sunnis more than now,” Ms. Fantappie said.But Sunnis could suffer political losses in April if hundreds of thousands of displaced Sunni constituents are unable to vote. If hard-line Shiite populists prevail, some reconstruction funds could end up going to poor Shiite regions rather than liberated Sunni areas.The post-Saddam era has proved ruinous for many Sunnis. After 2003, a de-Baathification program stripped hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civil servants of their jobs, including doctors and teachers. Many sacked Sunni army officers joined the Al Qaeda insurgency against American forces, though Sunni tribes later helped drive out the militants in the so-called Sunni Awakening.Elements of de-Baathification continued, however. Mr. Mutlaq, the Sunni lawmaker who had been a general in Mr. Hussein’s army, said a de-Baathification commission had barred him three times since 2010 from running for Parliament. “Pure political harassment,” he said.(He appealed, and now sits on Parliament’s security and defense committee.)Under Mr. Maliki, who was prime minister from 2006 to 2014, many Sunnis who had reclaimed their jobs were purged from the military and government, some for the second time. Festering Sunni resentment helped spur the rise of the Islamic State and allowed its fighters to take over Sunni towns and cities in 2014 with relative ease.The militants promised a new era of Sunni dominance, drawing widespread support from disenfranchised Sunnis. But they failed to deliver, and the reign of terror they imposed ultimately turned many Sunnis against them.Now Sunni towns like Karmah, where residents initially welcomed the militants, feel abandoned by their politicians. Karmah, with a population of about 95,000, was liberated in May 2016. The United Nations has provided some aid, rebuilding schools and making emergency infrastructure repairs.But the only sign in Karmah of the Iraqi agency charged with rebuilding liberated areas is the beginning of construction work on five schools. Mustafa al-Hiti, a Sunni pharmacist who directs the agency, said that just $140 million had been allocated by Baghdad this year for rebuilding all of the areas that had been under Islamic State rule. He estimated total costs for that job at more than $100 billion.He said international donors had allocated billions of dollars, but much of that money has been slowed by audits amid donor concerns about Iraq’s reputation for corruption.So Mr. Sallom is rebuilding his home in Karmah using his life savings and the help of his son, Ali Sirhan. Mr. Sirhan, 44, was asked whether he thought Sunni politicians would soon offer help.“Help?” Mr. Sirhan asked. “Forget help. They don’t even come visit, even if it’s just to say, ‘God help you.’”', "                                    North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un inspects the January 18 General Machine Plant in Pyongyang, North Korea in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on August 10, 2016.

That’s nearly three times as many who felt that way in January (12 percent). At that time, a majority said the greatest threat was terrorist groups like ISIS. But the number picking terrorist groups as the greatest threat has dropped by nearly half: from 51 percent to 27 percent today.Since January, North Korea has conducted nearly 40 missile tests or launches and fired off a long-range missile, while President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have traded insults. At the same time, Trump has threatened to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear agreement, while major progress was made in defeating the terrorist group ISIS in Raqqa.Opinion has also shifted on which type of attack poses the most immediate threat to the country’s security. Today, 38 percent say cyberattacks, 26 percent terrorist attacks, and 17 percent nuclear attacks. The number citing cyberattacks is up 3 points since January, and those pointing to nuclear attacks increased by 7 points. But the percentage saying terrorist attacks dropped 17 points.Meanwhile, when asked which poses a bigger threat here in the United States, 53 percent of voters say a shooting by an American citizen, while 27 percent say a terrorist attack by an Islamic terrorist.An October 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left nearly 500 people injured and 58 dead happened at the hands of an American citizen whose motive is yet unknown. There have been no confirmed ISIS-inspired attacks in the United States this year.By a 23-point margin, voters give the Trump administration negative ratings for its response to the Las Vegas shooting: 34 percent excellent/good vs. 57 percent fair/poor.President Trump’s ratings on handling North Korea are underwater by a 24-point margin (35 percent approve vs. 59 percent disapprove). On Iran, it’s a net negative by 21 points (34-55 percent).The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,005 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from October 22-24, 2017. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.", 'TOP OF THE MORNINGIt\'s Monday, Oct. 16, 2017.Welcome to Fox News First,your first stopfor today\'s news.

Enjoyyourday,and we\'llsee you in yourinbox first thingTuesdaymorning.', 'Judge Seeks Arrest of Ex-President of Argentina on Treason Charges - The New York TimesBUENOS AIRES — A federal judge  asked Argentina’s Senate on Thursday to allow the arrest of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the former president, on treason and other charges relating to Iran’s possible involvement in the unsolved 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, which killed 85 people.The request — made as part of a criminal case — added drama and uncertainty to the legal troubles that have engulfed Mrs. Kirchner, who was in office from 2007 to 2015 and is set to begin a term as a senator on Sunday. She also faces unrelated charges in several corruption investigations.On Thursday, Mrs. Kirchner called the prosecution politically motivated, and her supporters rallied in Buenos Aires. In a news conference, she said her successor, President Mauricio Macri, was creating a “smoke screen” to divert voters’ attention from controversial pension and labor reforms. “We will not be silent, we will not get scared,” Mrs. Kirchner said.The judge’s request, which includes an embargo of 50 million pesos ($2.9 million) on the former president’s assets, also deepens the mystery surrounding the 2015 death of a prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, who was investigating the bombing.Mr. Nisman’s body was found only hours before he was scheduled to provide testimony accusing Mrs. Kirchner, then the president, of collaborating with Iran in a cover-up of the attack. Thursday’s ruling means that the judge, Claudio Bonadio, found Mr. Nisman’s theory credible enough to be taken up by a court.In September, a team of forensic experts issued a report concluding that Mr. Nisman had been murdered. The report contradicted the findings of another team of experts, convened during Mrs. Kirchner’s tenure, which concluded that Mr. Nisman had most likely killed himself.Mrs. Kirchner has long denied any wrongdoing, including any involvement in Mr. Nisman’s death or collusion with Iran. (Mr. Nisman’s death is the subject of another investigation.)Judge Bonadio urged the Senate to lift Mrs. Kirchner’s immunity from arrest as an elected senator, so that she could be jailed to face the charges: aggravated concealment and obstruction of justice as well as treason.He argued that if she remained free, she could “hinder judicial actions as well as the discovery of the truth.”Argentine senators enjoy immunity from detention, but the protection does not shield them from prosecution.A Senate committee has 60 days to consider whether to lift her immunity, and then the full Senate would have up to 180 days to vote. The request must be approved by two-thirds of the senators present.Approval could be an uphill battle because Mr. Macri’s governing party — where Mrs. Kirchner’s critics are concentrated — lacks a majority.The Senate leader, Federico Pinedo, who is from Mr. Macri’s party, wrote on Twitter that when the request to strip Mrs. Kirchner of her immunity enters the Senate, “we will analyze it with seriousness and responsibility.” He added, “This is not about carrying out party politics but rather to make sure that institutions function properly.”But Mrs. Kirchner’s allies accused the government of Mr. Macri, long her political nemesis, of working with judges to destroy her legacy.“It is clear that we are in a scenario of political persecution of the leadership of the opposition,” Agustín Rossi, who was defense minister under Mrs. Kirchner and is now a lawmaker, told a local radio station.Mrs. Kirchner was president in 2013, when Argentina and Iran signed a memorandum of understanding that called for a commission to jointly investigate the bombing. The agreement never came into effect, and it was declared unconstitutional in 2015.On Thursday, Judge Bonadio said there was enough evidence to charge Mrs. Kirchner and her former allies with treason, because they had sought “impunity for the Iranian nationals accused of the attack on the AMIA headquarters and to normalize relations between the two states,” referring to the community center, the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina.The judge also approved similar charges against several associates of Mrs. Kirchner: Héctor Timerman, the former foreign minister; Carlos Zannini, who was essentially Mrs. Kirchner’s chief of staff; and a community activist, Luis D’Elía, among others.Some Argentine Jews, who overwhelmingly believe that Mr. Nisman was murdered, expressed support for Judge Bonadio’s decision.“Thee detentions show that Nisman’s complaint had solid elements,” said Ariel Cohen Sabban, the head of the Delegación de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentinas, a group that is close to AMIA and was critical in getting the case reopened. “It is a revindication of Nisman’s work.”Mrs. Kirchner will not be the first member of her administration to face efforts to remove her immunity. Julio De Vido, a former planning minister, was stripped of the immunity he enjoys as a member of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament, and turned himself in to authorities on graft charges in October.Iran has long denied any involvement in the AMIA bombing. Mr. Nisman, before his death, had filed a criminal complaint accusing Mrs. Kirchner and members of her government of trying to shield Iranian officials suspected of playing a role in the attack as part of a deal that would supply Iranian oil to Argentina. Judge Bonadio’s indictment on Thursday is based on that complaint.', 'Trump, Niger and Connecting the Dots - The New York TimesIt is easy to ignore the recent story of four U.S. servicemen killed in Niger, the giant state in central Africa, because the place is so remote and the circumstances still so murky. That would be a mistake. Niger highlights a much larger problem — just how foolish, how flat-out dumb President Trump is behaving.Trump is a person who doesn’t connect dots — even when they’re big, fat polka dots that are hard to miss. Rather, he thinks inside narrow little boxes built from his own simplistic impulses and applause lines — and that tendency is leading us into a web of contradictions abroad. Niger is a perfect example.I know something about Niger because I did a documentary there last year for National Geographic’s “Years of Living Dangerously” climate series and wrote several columns about it for The Times. To understand why groups affiliated with ISIS and Al Qaeda are popping up in that region of central Africa, you have to connect a lot of dots, and recognize the linkages between a number of different problems — not just say, in effect: There are bad guys there. I will call “my generals.” They will kill them. I will take credit.As defense systems expert Lin Wells once put it: To ameliorate problems in places like Niger, you must never think in the box. You must never think out of the box. “You must always think without a box.”Why? Because what is destabilizing all of these countries in the Sahel region of Africa and spawning terrorist groups is a cocktail of climate change, desertification — as the Sahara steadily creeps south — population explosions and misgovernance.Desertification is the trigger, and climate change and population explosions are the amplifiers. The result is a widening collapse of small-scale farming, the foundation of societies all over Africa. And that collapse is leading to a rising tide of “economic migrants, interethnic conflicts and extremism,” Monique Barbut, who heads the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and guided me in Niger, explained.A few numbers: Niger, with rampant poverty and poor access to contraception, has one the highest birthrates in the world: 7.6 children per woman. I met a man there who boasted of 17 kids. Neighboring Nigeria is growing so fast it will replace the U.S. as the third-most-populous country in the world by 2050. Nigeria is a third bigger than Texas.Meanwhile, climate change in the region is so severe that nearby Senegal’s national weather bureau says that from 1950 to 2015, the average temperature there rose two degrees Celsius and the average annual rainfall declined by about two inches. The Paris climate accord was designed to keep global average temperatures from rising two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by 2100.In other words, parts of sub-Saharan Africa are already at heat levels that Paris was supposed to prevent by the end of the century — and the region is heading for a four-degree rise, which will lead to the collapse of even more small farms and lead to a mad scramble of refugees toward Europe, competition for food and more unemployed males ready to join ISIS for $50 a month.Barbut, as I reported, reinforced her point by showing me three maps of Africa with dots concentrated in the middle of the continent. Map No. 1: the most vulnerable regions of desertification in 2008. Map No. 2: conflicts and food riots in 2007 and 2008. Map No. 3: terrorist attacks in 2012. All the dots of all three maps cluster around Niger and its neighbors. Hello?And what is Trump’s response to this reality? It’s to focus solely on using the U.S. military to kill terrorists in Africa while offering a budget that eliminates U.S. support for global contraception programs; appointing climate-change deniers to all key environmental posts; pushing coal over clean energy; and curbing U.S. government climate research.In short, he’s sending soldiers to fight a problem that is clearly being exacerbated by climate and population trends, while eliminating all our tools to mitigate these trends.That’s just stupid, reckless and irresponsible — and it evinces no ability to connect the dots or think without a box.But this is not only in Africa: Trump was obsessed with defeating ISIS in Syria and Iraq — but with as few U.S. troops as possible. The only way he could do that was by tacitly allying with Iran, Syria’s regime, Russia, pro-Iranian Shiite militias, and pro-U.S. Kurds, who were the main anti-ISIS forces on the ground. We could not defeat ISIS or stabilize Syria and Iraq without all of them.And what is Trump’s strategy now? I have no clue. We’ve distanced ourselves from the Kurds, moved to tear up the nuclear deal with Iran and added U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a country we also can’t stabilize without the tacit help of Iran next door. If you know how these dots connect, please write.Also: How do we stabilize our border with Mexico and maintain our neighbor’s cooperation in holding back the main source of illegal immigration today — refugees from Central America — while pursuing trade policies that have weakened the Mexican peso and the Mexican economy and could lead that country to elect its own anti-American populist-nationalist?Nothing Trump ever says has a second paragraph. His whole shtick is just a first paragraph: Build a wall, tear up the Iran deal, tear up TPP, defeat ISIS, send troops to Niger and Afghanistan to kill terrorists, kill climate policy, kill family planning, cut taxes, raise military spending. Every box just marks an applause line he needed somewhere to get elected. Nothing connects — and we will pay for that.Indeed, if you want to know what it looks like when a country follows a leader with no second paragraph and no ability to connect dots, visit London. I was there last week. Britain’s political system is in turmoil and its economy is facing declining growth prospects, because a bare majority voted to follow leaders with no second paragraph — we’ll just quit the European Union and everything will be fine, they said.Well, now it’s a fine little mess they have. The ruling Conservatives have no clue how to quit the E.U. without doing even more damage to their country’s future. That’s what happens when you vote for “disrupters” who never spent a second thinking through how all of their disruptions connect the morning after the morning after.Sound familiar?', 'IRBIL, Iraq – The Kurdish independence referendum in Iraq, while non-binding, is a symbolic milestone in the Kurds\' decades-long struggle to achieve statehood.The Kurds are among the largest stateless ethnic groups in the world, with some 30 million concentrated in an area straddling Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria. A minority in all four countries, the Kurds speak their own language, with several dialects. Most are Sunni Muslims.Denied their own state when colonial powers drew the map of the modern Middle East after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the Kurds have long pushed for autonomy or outright independence in all four countries, and have often been brutally repressed.All four countries, along with the United States and virtually the entire international community, are opposed to the referendum, making formal independence unlikely. But the vote has deep symbolic significance for the region\'s Kurds, and could lead to further unrest.TURKEYNearly half of the region\'s Kurds live in Turkey, where they endured decades of marginalization and discrimination, only gaining the right to speak the Kurdish language in the 1990s.The Turkish state quashed several Kurdish rebellions in the early years of the republic, after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. More recently, the Kurdistan Worker\'s Party, or PKK, has been waging a three-decade insurgency. The fighting has claimed tens of thousands of lives since 1984.Since coming to power in 2002, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\'s government has carried out reforms that have improved the minority group\'s rights and even initiated peace talks with the PKK. But the fragile peace-process collapsed in 2015, reigniting the bloody conflict in Turkey\'s predominantly Kurdish southeast region.About a dozen legislators from Turkey\'s pro-Kurdish political party, accused of being the political wing of the PKK, have been jailed on terror-related charges. The party denies links to the PKK, which is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies.___IRAQIn Iraq, the Kurds repeatedly rose up against the central government throughout the 20th century. In the 1980s, they sided with Iran against Saddam Hussein\'s government in the Iran-Iraq war. To punish them, Saddam launched a scorched-earth campaign and chemical attacks, which together killed an estimated 50,000 people.The U.S. imposed a no-fly zone after the 1990 Gulf war that granted the Kurds de facto autonomy in northern Iraq and made them a close American ally. The Kurds formalized their autonomy after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam, and the Kurdish region emerged as a rare success story, largely spared from the violence plaguing the rest of the country.The Kurdish self-rule zone officially makes up about 10 percent of Iraq\'s territory, with a population of about 3 million, around 8 percent of Iraq\'s total 37 million.Oil exports fueled an economic boom in the Kurdish region, leading to talk of a new Dubai in the heart of a troubled Middle East. But those hopes were largely dashed in 2014, when oil prices plunged and the Islamic State group swept across northern Iraq, drawing to within miles (kilometers) of the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil.The U.S. and its allies rushed aid to Kurdish forces, known as the peshmerga, who were eventually able to push the extremists back with the help of coalition airstrikes. In the process, however, they seized large areas outside their autonomous zone, escalating long-running territorial disputes with the central government. The Kurds and Baghdad have also been at odds over the sharing of oil revenues.___SYRIASyria\'s Kurds, who make up 10 percent of the country\'s population, were only granted the right to citizenship in 2011, when President Bashar Assad sought to win them over in the early days of the uprising against him.The main Syrian Kurdish party, known as the PYD, has benefited from a tacit non-aggression pact with Assad since the early months of the war, when the Syrian army withdrew from much of northeastern Syria to battle rebels elsewhere in the country, allowing the Kurds to carve out a zone of autonomy.The PYD\'s armed wing, known as the YPG, later expanded that enclave by battling the Islamic State group with the aid of U.S. airstrikes. They are now the main component of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, which has driven IS from much of northern Syria and is now battling the extremists in their de facto capital, Raqqa.Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the PKK, and sent troops into Syria a year ago to battle the Islamic State group and to stem the Kurds\' advance. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday warned of a similar intervention in response to the referendum in Iraq, saying "We could arrive suddenly one night."___IRANKurds represent about 10 percent of Iran\'s population of 80 million people, with many living in the mountainous northwest that borders Iraq and Turkey.A breakaway Kurdish republic backed by the Soviets briefly emerged in the Mahabad region after World War II, and an uprising broke out there in the years after Iran\'s 1979 Islamic Revolution. A guerrilla campaign by the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, or PDKI, continued for several years, until the group declared a unilateral cease-fire in 1996.The death of a Kurdish maid at a hotel in Mahabad in May 2015 sparked unrest, as opposition groups alleged Iranian security forces had a hand in it. Protests also erupted in Baneh this year when Iranian forces killed two Kurdish men.', 'Saudi Blockade of Yemen Threatens to Starve Millions, U.N. Says - The New York TimesSaudi Arabia’s three-day-old blockade of entry points to Yemen threatens to plunge that war-ravaged country into a famine that could starve millions of people, the top relief official of the United Nations said Wednesday.The warning by the official, Mark Lowcock, the world body’s coordinator of humanitarian aid, was perhaps the most dire so far regarding the blockade’s effects on what already is one of worst man-made disasters.Mr. Lowcock spoke at a closed meeting of United Nations Security Council diplomats who have expressed alarm over the deterioration in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country.The Yemen crisis has worsened since the Saudis imposed the blockade on Monday after a missile was fired deep into their territory by the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group, which has been warring with a Saudi-led military coalition for nearly three years.Despite Saudi Arabia’s assurances that the measure was temporary while it reviews inspection procedures, virtually all humanitarian deliveries to Yemen have been halted, including at least three United Nations airplanes full of emergency supplies.Mr. Lowcock said the Saudis must immediately allow the entry of food and medicine at all seaports, permit the immediate resumption of air services to the cities of Sana and Aden, and provide an “assurance of no further disruption to these services.”Without such steps, he said, Yemen will suffer “the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims.”The World Food Program, the anti-hunger agency of the United Nations, which has been feeding seven million people a month in Yemen, is now unable to do so, Mr. Lowcock said. “What we need is a winding down of the blockade to save the lives of those people.”The Security Council, which has condemned the missile launching into Saudi territory, took no immediate action regarding the blockade. Ambassador Sebastiano Cardi of Italy, the Council’s president for November, said members called on all parties in Yemen to “provide unhindered access for humanitarian supplies,” a reiteration of the Council’s position.Earlier Wednesday, 15 humanitarian relief groups expressed alarm in a joint statement that the blockade had imperiled lifesaving assistance to millions of people in Yemen.The country is struggling with an acute hunger crisis that has affected at least 17 million people, more than a third of them considered close to famine. Yemen also suffering a cholera scourge that has sickened nearly one million.“Given the current acute food-security crisis and cholera epidemic, any delays to the restoration and expansion of humanitarian access will cost the lives of women, men, girls and boys across the whole of Yemen,” the statement by the aid groups said.They warned that “in the absence of clarity and detail from the coalition, worrying questions remain about the extent and duration of these measures and their expected impact on the civilian population.”Without a quick end to the blockade, they said, “we fear an already catastrophic humanitarian and economic crisis will get substantially worse.”The signers included some of the most prominent international aid groups, including the International Rescue Committee, Oxfam and Save the Children.On Tuesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross pleaded with the Saudi-led coalition to allow Yemeni ports to continue receiving medical supplies, including chlorine tablets used to prevent cholera.“Humanitarian supply lines to Yemen must remain open,” said Robert Mardini, the Red Cross’s regional director for the Near and Middle East. “Food, medicine and other essential supplies are critical for the survival of 27 million Yemenis already weakened by a conflict now in its third year.”Saudi Arabia has described the blockade as necessary to prevent the Houthis, who are from Yemen’s north, and their allies from smuggling military weaponry into the country.The Saudis have accused Iran of delivering the type of missile to the Houthis that was launched at Saudi Arabia on Saturday, which traveled more than 500 miles before Saudi air defenses shot it down it near Riyadh, the capital. Iran, Saudi Arabia’s main rival in the Middle East, has denied the accusation.', 'RIYADH, Saudi Arabia – Saudi Arabia said its forces intercepted Saturday evening a ballistic missile fired from Yemen toward one of the kingdom\'s major international airports on the outskirts of the capital, Riyadh.The missile was fired from across Saudi Arabia\'s southern border by Yemen\'s Houthi rebels, who are at war with the kingdom. Several Houthi-owned media outlets, including Al-Masira and SABA, reported the rebels had launched the missile.The missile was shot down by Saudi air defense forces, with fragments of the missile landing in an uninhabited area north of the capital. Saudi Arabia\'s Civil Aviation Authority said the missile did not cause any damage to the King Khalid International Airport and that flights were not disrupted.This is the first time that a Houthi missile has come this close to a heavily populated area, and it appears to be the farthest that such a missile has reached inside Saudi Arabia. Riyadh is around 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) north of the country\'s border with Yemen.A Saudi military spokesman condemned the attack in a statement, saying the missile was fired "indiscriminately" toward a populated civilian area.Saudi military forces have intercepted missiles fired from Houthis several times since March 2015, when a Saudi-led coalition launched a war against Houthi rebels and their allies after they captured northern Yemen and ousted the Saudi-backed president from power. The kingdom has also imposed an air and sea blockade on Yemen.The stalemated war has killed more than 10,000 civilians and displaced 3 million others, pushing the Arab world\'s poorest country to the brink of famineThe U.S., which is one of the kingdom\'s most important military suppliers, has backed the coalition with logistical support.In the past, Saudi Arabia has accused its rival, Shiite power Iran, of training and helping arm the rebels. Iran denies that it has provided material support, though it acknowledges its political support of the Houthis.News outlet Al-Masira said the missile launched Saturday evening was made in Yemen and was the third to be fired toward Riyadh this year. It reported the rebels saying the missile was fired in response to "Saudi-American aggression and crimes against the people of Yemen."Earlier this week, a suspected airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition killed at least 29 people, including children, in northern Yemen.__Batrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.', 'Saudi King, in Russia, Seeks Warmer Ties With a Longtime Foe - The New York TimesMOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia warmly welcomed King Salman of Saudi Arabia under the gleaming chandeliers of the Kremlin on Thursday, signaling a rapprochement between two longtime rivals who have faced off in some of the world’s thorniest conflicts.King Salman’s visit, the first by a Saudi monarch, sought to cement growing ties between the world’s two largest oil producers, which have coordinated efforts to stabilize crude prices, lift their economies and end the war in Syria.The visit highlights efforts by King Salman, since he ascended the throne in 2015, to shift away from his country’s historical reliance on the United States and diversify its international partnerships, analysts said.The visit also acknowledges Russia’s increasing clout in the Middle East, and the kingdom’s tacit acceptance of the enduring rule of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, whom Saudi Arabia had opposed and Russia had intervened to save.“We cannot ignore that Russia has become a key player in the Middle East, particularly due to the Obama doctrine that saw the U.S. role in the region shrink,” said Faisal J. Abbas, editor in chief of Saudi Arabia’s Arab News, who was in Moscow for the visit. “Russia, with its financial and military might, stepped into the equation.”The recalibration of the kingdom’s foreign relations comes as it ushers in domestic reforms that could alter its socially conservative society. King Salman, 81, removed the power of arrest from the country’s religious police, and announced last week that the ban on women driving would be lifted. Other changes, such as repealing the ban on cinemas, are expected soon.For more than half a century, Saudi Arabia has looked to the United States as its most important ally, working closely with successive administrations on economic, political and security issues across the Middle East.For much of that time, Saudi Arabia remained hostile to the Soviet Union, backing Islam as antidote to communism and contributing to far-flung Cold War insurgencies.In the 1980s, it partnered with the Central Intelligence Agency and Pakistan against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Salman, then a young prince, led a committee that raised money from wealthy Saudis to support the Afghan mujahedeen fighting the Soviets.More recently, Saudi Arabia supported anti-Kremlin rebels in the restive republic of Chechnya. The kingdom maintains ties with Russia’s predominantly Muslim regions, including Chechnya, where the conflict was brutally ended by Mr. Putin and his local ally, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, leader of the Chechen Republic.The symbolism of the Saudi king traveling to Moscow, just months after President Trump flew to Riyadh and lavished praise on his Saudi hosts, spoke volumes about changing relationships in the Middle East.In recent years, Saudi Arabia and Russia were at odds in Syria, where the kingdom partnered with the United States and other countries to back rebels seeking to overthrow Mr. Assad. Russia, Mr. Assad’s longtime ally, sent forces in 2015 that turned the tide, and now Mr. Assad’s future appears secure.As the Saudis have given up on the possibility of regime change in Damascus, their stance toward Russia has changed. Russia is likely to seek Saudi support for its efforts to establish “de-escalation zones” to bring down the violence, analysts said. And Saudi Arabia is likely to seek Russian help in pushing back against Iran, its regional nemesis.But analysts doubted that Russia would take the Saudi side against Iran, given its battlefield partnership with Iran to help Mr. Assad in Syria.“Definitely, Russia’s operation in Syria put Moscow into the front line of Middle Eastern politics,” said Grigory Kosach, expert for the Russian International Affairs Council. “Saudi Arabia believes that they now have to build relations with Russia because it plays a significant role in their home region. However, Russia is acting there in tandem with Iran, which worries the Saudis.”Oil has brought them closer, too.After the sharp drop in oil prices in 2014, both nations faced similar perils: budget deficits and the need to diversify their exports. Being the two biggest oil producers, they were the principal backers of an oil production freeze agreement that stopped the price fall.“This deal has opened a new page in the Russian-Saudi relations,” wrote Marianna Belenkaya, a Middle East analyst, in a commentary for the Carnegie Moscow Center. “Both sides saw that dialogue is possible.”While agreements with Russia may not directly affect the kingdom’s interactions with Washington, they could give Russia leverage to interfere.“American preferred access to Saudi oil, and the two countries’ close cooperation, has been the bedrock of the American-Saudi relationship since its inception, which in turn has been a pillar of U.S. strategy in the Middle East,” wrote Firas Maksad, the deputy executive director of the Arabia Foundation in Washington. “Putin now has a greater ability to influence, and potentially disrupt, that relationship than ever before.”Mr. Putin hinted as much when asked about the United States-Saudi alliance during an economic forum in Moscow this week.“Is there anything permanent in the world?” he said. “I think, on the contrary, the world is changing all the time.”Critics note that previous efforts toward rapprochement between the two nations have foundered, and it remains unclear whether the memorandums of understanding signed Thursday will result in concrete projects.The two countries agreed to move toward deeper cooperation on space programs, weapons deals and other issues, and signed an agreement to create a $1 billion joint investment fund. They also announced a plan to manufacture Russia’s famous Kalashnikov rifles in the kingdom as part of its budding military industry.Russia’s economy is much smaller than that of the United States and is hurting from sanctions, some applied by the United States and Europe after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, and others added by the United States in response to Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. Russia’s military, too, is dwarfed by that of the United States. Decades of cooperation would make it difficult for the Saudis to separate from their American ally, and they have expressed no intention of doing so.Moreover, increased Russian-Saudi ties need not contradict American interests, said Theodore Karasik, senior adviser to Gulf State Analytics, a Washington-based consultancy.“The idea that Russia and Saudi are working together to rework the region across a spectrum of issues can be an American interest, but there needs to be an awakening of what the true relationship is between the Russian Federation and the countries of the Middle East,” Mr. Karasik said.The Saudi investment in closer ties was clear on Thursday.About 1,000 people joined the king’s delegation, Russian news media reported, taking over the Four Seasons and other luxury hotels near the Kremlin.', 'Pentagon downplays the \'misunderstanding\' between U.S. allies; Connor Powell reports on attempts to diffuse the \'messy\' situation in the region.KIRKUK, Iraq – Kurdish forces were withdrawing from Kirkuk on Monday as Iraqi federal forces moved in to the disputed city and seized oil fields and other infrastructure amid soaring tensions over last month\'s Kurdish vote for independence.Kurdish officials accused the Iraqi army of carrying out a "major, multi-prong attack," and reported heavy clashes on the city\'s outskirts, but a spokesman for Iraq\'s state-backed militias said they encountered little resistance.By midday, federal forces had moved into several major oil fields north of the city, as well as its airport and an important military base, according to Iraqi commanders. Kurdish party headquarters inside Kirkuk had been abandoned.The U.S., which has armed, trained and provided vital air support to both sides in their shared struggle against the Islamic State group, described Monday\'s events as "coordinated movements, not attacks," while bemoaning the dispute as a distraction against a common enemy. It said the limited exchange of fire was a "misunderstanding."After initial reports of clashes in and around the city, it appeared by the afternoon as though the vastly outnumbered Kurdish forces, known as the peshmerga, were pulling out with hardly a fight.Local police stayed in place in Kirkuk as Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi called on civil servants to remain at their posts to serve the city. "We have only acted to fulfill our constitutional duty and extend the federal authority and impose security and protect the national wealth in this city," he said.Still, thousands of civilians could be seen leaving with their belongings heading north along the country roads that lead to Iraq\'s autonomous Kurdish region.Kirkuk, home to some 1 million Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen and Christians, has been at the heart of a long-running dispute between the autonomous Kurdish region and the central government in Baghdad. Both are close allies of the U.S.The Kurdistan Region Security Council said early Monday that the peshmerga destroyed at least five U.S.-supplied Humvees being used by Iraq\'s state-sanctioned militias following the "unprovoked attack" south of the city.Brig. Gen. Bahzad Ahmed, a spokesman for Kurdish forces, said federal forces seized an oil and gas company and other industrial areas south of Kirkuk in fighting with Kurdish forces that caused "lots of casualties," without providing a specific figure.He said Iraqi forces have "burnt lots of houses and killed many people" south of the disputed city. His claims could not be independently verified.A spokesman for Iraq\'s state-sanctioned militias said they had "achieved all our goals" in retaking areas from Kurdish forces in and around the northern city. Ahmed al-Assadi said federal forces came under fire from "some rebels" after launching the operation early Monday and returned fire. He did not say whether they suffered any casualties.He said federal forces have been deployed in the area of the K-1 military base, the Kirkuk airport and a number of oil fields and installations. The Iraqi military said it seized two major oil fields outside the city.Al-Assadi said the state-backed militias, mainly Shiite Arab fighters known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, have not entered the city center, but Associated Press reporters saw Turkmen PMF militiamen taking up posts in the western part of the city.Tensions have soared since the Kurds held a non-binding referendum last month in which they voted for independence from Iraq. The central government, along with neighboring Turkey and Iran, as well as the United States, rejected the vote.The central government and the autonomous Kurdish region have long been divided over the sharing of oil revenues and the fate of disputed territories like Kirkuk that are controlled by Kurdish forces but are outside their self-ruled region.The Kurds assumed control of Kirkuk, in the heart of a major oil-producing region, in the summer of 2014, when IS militants swept across northern Iraq and the country\'s armed forces crumbled.Iraq has since rebuilt its armed forces with considerable U.S. aid, and they are battle-hardened and flush with victory after driving IS from most of the territory it once held. Fighting alongside the armed forces are tens of thousands of state-sanctioned militiamen, mainly Shiite Arab fighters backed by Iran, whom the Kurds view as an instrument of demographic change. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said the militias will remain outside the city.State-run Al-Iraqiya TV had earlier reported that federal forces rolled into parts of the countryside outside Kirkuk without facing resistance. However, some residents of the city and an Iraqi militia commander reported shelling.Al-Iraqiya carried a statement from al-Abadi\'s office saying he had ordered federal forces to "impose security in the city in cooperation with the inhabitants and the peshmerga," indicating he was willing to share administration.Baghdad has been turning the screws on the Kurdish region since the September referendum, pushing Kurdish leaders to disavow the vote and accept shared administration over Kirkuk.Iraq\'s government barred international flights to and from the region and asked neighboring Turkey and Iran to close their borders. Iran closed its three official crossings with the Kurdish region Sunday, Kurdish media reported. It also froze currency transfers to four banks operating in the Kurdish region.Al-Abadi\'s Cabinet said Sunday that fighters from Turkey\'s Kurdish insurgency, the PKK, were beginning to appear in Kirkuk, and declared that would be tantamount to an act of war.', 'Trump to Hannity: NFL Players \'Cannot Disrespect Our Country, Our Flag or Our Anthem\'President Donald Trump told Fox News\' Sean Hannity Wednesday that the NFL should have suspended quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner.""The NFL should have suspended him for one game and he would have never done it again," Trump told host Sean Hannity in Harrisburg, Pa. "They could have then suspended him for two games and they could have suspended him again if he did it a third time, for the season, and you would never have had a problem."Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem last season as part of a protest against police brutality while a member of the San Francisco 49ers. Kaepernick has since become a free agent and has been unable to get a job with another NFL team.On Tuesday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to team owners that he believed players should stand for the national anthem, adding that the league would consider a rule change requiring players to stand.Colin Kaepernick, center, knelt during the playing of the national anthem prior to every game during the 2016 NFL season.(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)"I will tell you," Trump told Hannity, "you cannot disrespect our country, our flag, our anthem, you cannot do that."Trump was in Pennsylvania to promote his tax reform plan, which would dramatically cut corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 20 percent. The plan also would reduce the number of personal income tax brackets and boost the standard deduction."A family can get and a business can get ... as much as a 40% tax reduction," Trump promised. "It\'s the largest tax reduction in the history of our country."When asked if he was confident the plan would pass the Senate, Trump responded that " I can’t imagine the largest tax cut for people in our history not passing" before asking rhetorically, "I mean, who\'s going to vote against this?"The president noted that his tax plan had forced his drive to repeal and replace ObamaCare to take a backseat, but claimed "I actually think, right now, we have the votes" to pass a plan. Trump also leveled criticism at Republican senators who balked at previous ObamaCare repeal plans."Two people decide they want to do something for whatever reason, and in some cases it is grandstanding," Trump said. "Now, all of a sudden, you don’t have health care. But we’re going to get it anyway."Trump also criticized the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, calling it "one of the most incompetently drawn deals I\'ve ever seen.""They got a path to nuclear weapons very quickly and ... $1.7 billion in cash," Trump said. "You know how many airplane loads that must be? Did you ever see a million dollars, like a promotion, where they have a million dollars in $100 bills? It\'s a lot ... So, this is the worst deal. We got nothing."The president reportedly will declare Iran to be not in compliance with the nuclear agreement in a major policy address later this week.Trump also lashed out at the ongoing investigation over Russian actions during last year\'s presidential election, calling it "an excuse used by the Democrats when they lost the election.""They sat in a room and they said, \'Wow, we look bad.\' The morning after, in fact it\'s been written about in various books, or a book, but they said, \'Why did you lose the election?\'" the president said. "And they said, \'Ah, it was Russia! Russia!\' It wasn\'t Russia, it was a bad candidate."', 'Judge argues the updated ban simply continues President Trump\'s \'promise to exclude Muslims from the United States.\'A federal judge in Hawaii has blocked President Trump’s revised travel ban – just hours before it was expected to go into effect across the United States.Tuesday’s decision from U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu stops the administration’s third attempt to indefinitely ban entry into the country by most nationals of Libya, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea. The ban would also prevent some Venezuelan government officials and their families."Today’s dangerously flawed district court order undercuts the President’s efforts to keep the American people safe and enforce minimum security standards for entry into the United States," the White House said in a statement. "The Department of Justice will vigorously defend the President’s lawful action."Watson, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, found Trump\'s executive order "suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor."The judge said the new restrictions ignore a federal appeals court ruling that found Trump\'s previous ban exceeds the scope of his authority. The latest version "plainly discriminates based on nationality in the manner that the 9th Circuit has found antithetical to ... the founding principles of this nation," Watson wrote.The government has said the new policy was based on an objective assessment of each country\'s security situation and willingness to share information with the U.S.U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson(George Lee/The Star Advertiser via AP)Hawaii argued in court documents that the updated ban is a continuation of Trump\'s "promise to exclude Muslims from the United States" despite the addition of two non-majority Muslim countries.Other courts are weighing challenges to the latest travel restrictions.In Maryland, the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups are seeking to block the visa and entry restrictions in the president\'s latest proclamation.Washington state, Massachusetts, California, Oregon, New York and Maryland have challenged the policy before U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle, who struck down Trump\'s initial ban in January.That policy led to chaos and confusion at airports nationwide and triggered several lawsuits, including one from Hawaii.When Trump revised the ban, state Attorney General Doug Chin changed the lawsuit to challenge that version. In March, Watson agreed with Hawaii that it amounted to discrimination based on nationality and religion.A subsequent U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed the administration to partially reinstate that 90-day ban on visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees.But it said the policy didn\'t apply to refugees and travelers with a "bona fide relationship" with a person or entity in the U.S.Hawaii then successfully challenged the federal government\'s definition of which family members would be allowed into the country. Watson ordered the government not to enforce the ban on close relatives such as grandparents, grandchildren, uncles and aunts.The judge\'s order Tuesday prevents acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson from implementing the latest travel ban.Watson said he would set an expedited hearing to determine whether the temporary restraining order should be extended.The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'BEIRUT – Syrian activists and a monitoring group say almost two dozen civilians have been killed in the last three days of fighting in the suburb of the capital, Damascus, along with dozens of government forces and rebels.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says that since Tuesday, 22 civilians died from government shelling and bombardment of the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta suburb.It says 29 pro-government fighters have been killed while scores of rebels were killed or wounded. The fighting is the latest breach of a local truce, brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran.The activist-run Ghouta Media Center says 15 civilians were killed on Wednesday, when Ahrar al-Sham rebel faction penetrated into a Syrian military compound in the area to battle pro-government fighters there. The fighting is still underway.', "BEIRUT – Syrians are getting ready for a new round of diplomacy intended to forge a path forward for a political transition in the country after six years of war.As the sides prepare for what will be the eighth round of U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Geneva later this month, one thing is clear and that is that President Bashar Assad has survived the war.One reason is military.

President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital could incite extremists in the region -- making conditions "favorable to terrorism" against U.S. targets, Iraq\'s government warned Thursday.Iraqi leaders in Baghdad called for Trump to reverse his decision, saying that it could threaten stability in the Middle East.“We caution against the dangerous repercussions of this decision on the stability of the region and the world,” the government\'s statement said.An Iran-backed militia operating in Iraq echoed Baghdad\'s statement, saying Trump’s "stupid decision" would be a “legitimate reason” to attack U.S. troops in Iraq, Reuters reported.“Trump’s stupid decision to make Jerusalem a capital for the Zionist will be the big spark for removing this entity from the body of the Islamic nation, and a legitimate reason to target American forces,” said Akram al-Kaabi, the group\'s leader.The militia, Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, is composed of some 10,000 Iraqi fighters under an umbrella of Iran-backed Shi’ite militias.Iraq has also summoned the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad and plans to hand over a memo protesting the new policy, Reuters reported.Meanwhile, the Palestinian group Hamas -- recognized as terrorists by the U.S. -- threatened its own retaliation against Israel following Trump\'s declaration of the new U.S. policy, a separate Reuters report said.

The results have not yet been announced, but the Kurdish Regional Government said on Tuesday that the vote had gone overwhelmingly in favor of independence from Iraq.A “yes” vote would not lead to an immediate declaration of independence for the semiautonomous region, but it would direct the regional government to begin the process of creating an independent state, including negotiating a separation with Baghdad.Iraqi officials have called the referendum unconstitutional and have refused to negotiate with the Kurdish leadership. The Iraqis fear losing a third of the country and a major source of oil should Kurdistan break away.Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Tuesday that his government had decided to demand control of the airports because the referendum had “destabilized” the region. He said humanitarian and other “urgent” flights would be exempt from the ban.Referring to the Kurdish leadership, he added, “Unfortunately, some have tried to weaken Iraq and be stronger than the state.”“We are partners in this country, and the partnership means we work together and don’t carry out unilateral decisions that lead to division and conflict and weakness,” Mr. Abadi said.There was no immediate response by leaders of the Kurdistan Regional Government. In an address in Erbil on Tuesday night, Massoud Barzani, the region’s president, referred indirectly to Mr. Abadi’s ultimatum.“We ask the Baghdad government not to threaten the Kurds because of the referendum,” he said. He urged the Iraqi government to enter negotiations and to respect what he said was the will of the Kurdish people to seek a nation of their own.He added that the referendum had been approved by a wide margin, though he did not provide figures. The Kurdish authorities are expected to announce the vote results on Wednesday.Turkey and Iran fear that a move toward independence by the Iraqi Kurds will inflame separatist fervor among their countries’ Kurdish minorities. Videos on social media showed Kurds in at least two Iranian cities celebrating the Iraqi Kurds’ vote.The United States also opposed the vote, worried that it could set off ethnic conflict, break up Iraq and undermine the American-led coalition against the Islamic State.Both Turkey and Iran have threatened sanctions against the Kurdish region, including the closing of border crossings. Turkish and Iraqi troops are conducting military exercises on Iraq’s northern border near Kurdistan, and Iranian forces are carrying out similar maneuvers on Iraq’s eastern border.Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said Tuesday that Kurdistan’s action risked provoking a wider conflict, and he warned that Kurds would go hungry from a trade blockade with Turkey.“If Barzani and the Kurdish Regional Government do not reverse this mistake as soon as possible, they will go down in history with the shame of taking the region into an ethnic and sectarian war,” he said in a televised speech from Ankara.The Kurdish regional government, which has its own parliament and military force, operates international airports in its capital, Erbil, and in the northern city of Sulaimaniyah. There is no domestic Kurdish airline in the autonomous region.Iraq asked other countries last week to halt flights into the Kurdish region, but only Iran complied.Mr. Abadi is expected to meet on Wednesday with the Iraqi Parliament, which has voted to request that Iraqi troops be sent to disputed areas that are controlled by the Kurds but claimed by Baghdad. The would include the multiethnic, oil-rich city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds seized in 2014.As the Islamic State rose in northern Iraq in 2014, Kurdish fighters took advantage of the chaos, and in some cases of fleeing Iraqi troops, to expand the Kurdish territory by 40 percent.The Iraqi Parliament has also requested that the government consider closing land crossings linking Iraqi Kurdistan and the rest of the country.The move by Mr. Abadi was viewed in Kurdistan as the beginning of a campaign to pressure the region to back away from independence.For the Kurds, an independent state has been a national aspiration for generations. When borders in the Middle East were redrawn after World War I, the Kurds were denied a homeland. About 30 million Kurds are spread across Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey.For decades, Baathist-led governments in Baghdad tried to crush or evict the Kurds from their traditional lands and replace them with Arabs. But the Kurds were protected from Saddam Hussein’s troops by an American no-fly zone starting in 1991, and have since built a thriving proto-state across northern Iraq.Analysts say that even if the referendum does not result in immediate independence, it strengthens the Kurds’ leverage in negotiating greater autonomy from Baghdad.', 'IRBIL, Iraq – The president of Iraq\'s Kurdish region says the controversial vote on independence will go ahead as planned on Monday, despite mounting pressures from within the region and beyond.Speaking at a press conference in Irbil Sunday, Masoud Barzani said that while the vote will be the first step in a long process to negotiate independence, the region\'s "partnership" with the Iraqi central government in Baghdad is over.Baghdad, the United States and the United Nations have all voiced strong opposition to the vote set for Monday, warning it could further destabilize the region as Iraqi and Kurdish forces continue to battle the Islamic State group.Earlier Sunday, Iran closed its airspace to flights taking off from Iraq\'s Kurdish region following a request from Baghdad.', "AMMAN, Jordan – Jordan hopes a cease-fire it helped negotiate for a southern region in neighboring Syria will eventually lead to a secure border, the reopening of a vital trade crossing and a gradual return home for Syrian war refugees who sought asylum in the kingdom.But for now, these goals seem out of reach as key security concerns remain unanswered.Fighting has decreased significantly in southern Syria — a patchwork of areas under government or rebel control — since the truce was negotiated by Russia, the United States and Jordan in July.But pro-Western Jordan still seeks guarantees from Syrian President Bashar Assad and his backers, Russia and Iran, that moderate Syrian opposition fighters and civilians will not be harmed as Assad's forces continue to advance in the southeast, despite the truce.", "TEHRAN, Iran – Iran's semi-official ILNA news agency is reporting that the country's authorities have banned former reformist President Mohammad Khatami from appearing at public ceremonies for three months.The Saturday report quotes Mohammad Anjam, Khatami's lawyer, as saying that a letter attributed to a judicial authority has been delivered to Khatami house saying that he has been barred from public political, cultural and promotional ceremonies for three months starting September 23.Khatami is considered to have played a key role in Hassan Rouhani's ascension to the presidency in 2013 and 2017, apparently convincing reformist challenger Mohammad Reza Aref to step aside.Khatami, who served as president from 1997 to 2005, is considered to be the spiritual leader of Iran's reformists, and remains influential among youth despite being under a media ban.", '', 'Five Strongmen, and the Fate of the Arab Spring - The New York TimesOne is in quiet exile. One was imprisoned and now lives in virtual house arrest. One remains in power, in a country shattered by war. Two met violent deaths.The news on Monday that Yemen’s ex-president had been killed is not only a key moment in a country that is wracked by civil war, torn by a sectarian proxy struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran and the home of what has been called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.It is also a reminder of the dashed hopes in the region, seven years after a fruit vendor’s self-immolation in Tunisia touched off what became known as the Arab Spring.Here is a look at what has befallen five leaders in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen, the countries at the center of the political uprisings that began in 2011. In only one country, Tunisia, is there a semblance of pluralist democracy.Ousted in February 2011 after nearly 30 years in power, Mr. Mubarak, 89, once symbolized the unassailable Arab strongman, and his downfall appeared to signal a political sea change. He was imprisoned and prosecuted on charges that included conspiracy to kill protesters and rampant corruption, proceedings punctuated by riveting images of Mr. Mubarak on trial in a defendant’s cage.But public anger toward Mr. Mubarak faded as Egypt was roiled by more political upheavals: the overthrow of a democratically elected, but highly divisive, Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, and his replacement by a military strongman, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who led a severe campaign of repressing dissent. In March, Mr. Sisi’s government quietly released Mr. Mubarak from prison, although he remains under an anticorruption investigation and cannot leave Egypt. He lives in a guarded mansion in Cairo.A quirky and ruthless leader who considered himself king of Africa, dressed in Bedouin robes and ruled Libya for more than 40 years, Colonel Qaddafi was toppled in August 2011 after a popular rebellion that was aided by NATO warplanes. He was killed two months later at age 69 by insurgents who had flushed him out of his hometown, Surt, and put his body on display in a meat locker in the city of Misurata.Libya has since descended into a bubbling state of semi-anarchy and is a haven for human smugglers who exploit refugees and migrants seeking boat passage to Europe.Mr. Ben Ali, 81, the first of the Arab autocrats to be ousted, enjoyed what critics called an obscenely opulent life. It made for a stark contrast with the struggles of ordinary Tunisians, whose despair seemed exemplified by the fate of the fruit vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi.Mr. Ben Ali fled Tunisia with his family in January 2011 for Saudi Arabia, where the government has allowed them to live quietly and have rejected Tunisian requests to extradite him.Mr. Saleh, considered one of the most cunning autocrats in the Arab world, stepped down in early 2012 after three decades of leading Yemen, the Middle East’s most impoverished country. He remained a powerful political personality and later aligned himself in with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have been fighting a Saudi-led military coalition for nearly three years.He was killed on Monday at the age of 75, in an explosion of mayhem in Sana, Yemen’s capital, after he was said to have switched sides yet again, in a betrayal of his Houthi allies, who are backed by Iran.Confounding predictions by Western leaders that he was next in line to fall, President Assad has remained in power through a 2011 uprising that morphed into a civil war, devastated Syria and created a staggering refugee crisis.Assisted by allies Russia and Iran, the forces of Mr. Assad, 52, a former eye doctor, have retaken wide swaths of Syria that had been lost to a mix of insurgents and Islamist extremists. But much of his country is in ruins, with rebuilding costs estimated by the United Nations to exceed $250 billion. Negotiations to end the war remain tenuous, with no clarity on Mr. Assad’s future role.', 'Rex Tillerson, Visiting Europe, Gets Cold Shoulder - The New York TimesBRUSSELS — For decades, America’s chief diplomat has been greeted in Europe’s heart with broad smiles and open arms.That tradition appeared to have been suspended on Tuesday.Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson’s reception in Brussels was distinctly chilly, as disappointment among European diplomats in President Trump’s nationalistic tone and insulting messages on Twitter built into quiet fury on the eve of an expected  announcement that the United States would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Such a move could infuriate the Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem to be their capital in a future Palestinian state.In a brief public appearance beside Mr. Tillerson, Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s top diplomat, gave the kind of stone-cold statement of facts that she would normally provide standing beside her Russian counterpart, not the American one.She made clear that the European Union saw the Trump administration’s possible announcement on Jerusalem as a threat to peace in the Middle East.“We believe that any action that would undermine these efforts must absolutely be avoided,” she said. “A way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as a future capital of both states.”Ms. Mogherini also warned the United States not to walk away from the Iran nuclear deal, something President Trump has said he may do.“The continued implementation of the Iran nuclear deal is a key strategic priority for European security but also for regional and global security,” she said.Mr. Tillerson’s spokesman, R.C. Hammond, acknowledged the less-than-warm reception.“Allies have been very frank today in sharing some of their views,” Mr. Hammond said.Ms. Mogherini’s remarks came just hours after Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel of Germany declared at a foreign policy conference in Berlin that relations with the United States “will never be the same” and said that the Trump administration increasingly viewed Europe as a “competitor or economic rival” rather than an ally.On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron of France warned Mr. Trump in a phone call that recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was a bad idea, joining leaders from Jordan, Egypt, Turkey and the Arab League in speaking out publicly against the move.Mr. Trump’s nationalistic rhetoric and frequent complaints about what he sees as European freeloading on American military spending has long grated on European leaders, but in recent weeks their annoyance has turned to anger.When Mr. Tillerson and Ms. Mogherini gave public statements, Ms. Mogherini never smiled and she refused to answer questions.Into this growing rift the Trump administration sent a chief diplomat who could be pushed out within weeks and has little of the president’s confidence, according to senior administration officials.For his part, Mr. Tillerson stood beside Ms. Mogherini and offered innocuous comments in which he reaffirmed “the important role that the European alliance plays in our shared security objectives.”Mr. Tillerson spoke at far greater length in a morning visit to the United States Embassy in Brussels but spent most of his time describing his departmental reorganization effort, not addressing the growing diplomatic challenges his employees face in Europe and elsewhere.He admitted that the Trump administration had yet to notch a single major diplomatic victory.“While we don’t have any wins on the board yet, I can tell you we’re in much better position to advance America’s interests around the world than we were 10 months ago,” Mr. Tillerson said.He promised to announce his reorganization plans within weeks and grew animated when describing the process. Mr. Tillerson made the remarks at the ambassadorial residence, which is not presently occupied. The administration has yet to nominate ambassadors to both Belgium and the European Union.From Brussels, Mr. Tillerson heads to Vienna, where three ambassadorial jobs — to Austria and two European bodies — also remain unfilled. Dozens of top jobs in the department are empty.“We’re still awaiting a lot of nominees to clear the processes and be confirmed,” he told the gathering. “I get a little criticism for that from time to time.”Mr. Tillerson’s own delays in identifying leaders also has been a big obstacle. Now that he may leave within weeks, the White House vetting process for his choices has slowed to a crawl.', 'Turkey Seizes Assets of Reza Zarrab, Witness in Sanctions-Evasion Case - The New York TimesTurkish prosecutors on Friday ordered the seizure of assets belonging to an Iranian-Turk gold trader who has been a key witness in the Manhattan trial of a Turkish bank executive accused of violating United States sanctions on Iran, Turkish state media reported.The order cited a part of the Turkish penal code that addresses the leaking of state secrets. It came a day after the witness, Reza Zarrab, testified in Federal District Court that he was told in 2012 by a Turkish official that Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then prime minister, ordered two Turkish banks to participate in a billion-dollar sanctions-busting scheme.Mr. Zarrab, 34, entered a secret guilty plea in October to conspiring to evade the sanctions and other charges, and, in a bid to reduce his punishment, agreed to assist prosecutors. Mr. Zarrab, whose plea agreement was reported this week in court, testified on Wednesday that “cooperation was the fastest way to accept responsibility and to get out of jail at once.”A newly unsealed transcript of Mr. Zarrab’s plea hearing shows that when he appeared before Judge Richard M. Berman on Oct. 26, he gave a detailed admission of his crimes, saying that from 2010 until his arrest in 2016, he conspired with others to obstruct the Treasury Department’s enforcement of the Iran sanctions.He also admitted that while being jailed in Manhattan, he bribed a correctional officer in return for alcohol and the use of a cellphone. He ultimately pleaded guilty to seven charges.As part of Mr. Zarrab’s plea deal, the transcript shows, the government agreed to take steps to ensure his safety and that of “his family and loved ones,” including potential placement in the witness protection program.The case involving Mr. Zarrab and the Turkish bank executive on trial, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, and seven other defendants who remain at large, has raised tensions between Turkey and the United States. Turkish officials have said the case is based on fabricated evidence and is a politically motivated plot to undermine the country’s economy and its leader, Mr. Erdogan, who is now president.In a speech in Istanbul, Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, on Friday called for Mr. Zarrab to reverse his decision to cooperate with the American authorities.“God willing, he will turn back from this mistake,” Mr. Yildirim said.Turkish state and pro-government media outlets have not reported on key developments in the trial, including Mr. Zarrab’s testimony this week implicating Mr. Erdogan and his account of paying tens of millions of dollars in bribes to Zafer Caglayan when he was the country’s economy minister, as part of the scheme. Mr. Caglayan has also been charged in the case and is one of the defendants not in custody.The Turkish state news agency, however, was the first to report on Friday’s court order to confiscate all of the assets of Mr. Zarrab and his family, including his wife, Ebru Gundes, a famous Turkish pop singer.Asked about the Turkish order to seize Mr. Zarrab’s assets, his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said, “It would be inappropriate to comment until after the trial of Mr. Atilla is completed.” Prosecutors had no comment.Mr. Zarrab testified in court for a third day on Friday, offering more details about the oil-for-gold scheme. He also described how the conspirators disguised some of their transfers of Iranian oil proceeds as food sales.“Were you actively sending food?” a prosecutor, Sidhardha Kamaraju, asked Mr. Zarrab.“You mean physically, food?“Yes.”“No, I never sent food, physically,” Mr. Zarrab said.', 'Reza Zarrab Recounts Death Threat to Iran Sanctions Jury - The New York TimesReza Zarrab, the chief government witness in a trial involving a billion-dollar scheme to smuggle gold for oil in violation of United States sanctions on Iran, testified on Thursday that his life had been threatened in a federal detention center in Brooklyn after he began cooperating with the prosecution.A fellow inmate, saying he had been given instructions to kill him, pulled a knife on him, Mr. Zarrab said.“I was about to lose my life,” he told the jury.“He said that he had heard that I was cooperating — that’s why he was doing it,” Mr. Zarrab added.As a result of the threat, he was removed from the Brooklyn jail and placed in the F.B.I.’s custody at an undisclosed location.Mr. Zarrab, 34, told the jury that had he not chosen to cooperate, it is possible that he would never have been threatened.“But did you choose to be a witness anyway?” a prosecutor, Sidhardha Kamaraju said.“I’m here now,” Mr. Zarrab responded. “Yes, sir.”The testimony in Federal District Court in Manhattan came on Mr. Zarrab’s seventh and final day on the witness stand in the trial of a Turkish banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was also charged in the scheme.Mr. Zarrab’s wide-ranging account suggested that a high-level Turkish official — who was not named but from the testimony and trial exhibits appears to be Recep Tayyip Erdogan, now Turkey’s president — had more extensive knowledge of the sanctions-busting activity than had been disclosed previously.Last week, Mr. Zarrab testified that he had been told that Mr. Erdogan gave orders in 2012, when he was prime minister, that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in the scheme, which Mr. Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, helped orchestrate.Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly denounced the case as a fabrication.Mr. Zarrab, responding to the prosecutor’s questions, also described the toll his cooperation had taken. He noted that while he was testifying for the government last week, prosecutors back in Turkey ordered the seizure of his assets and those of nearly 20 other people.Turkish officials cited a part of the Turkish penal code that concerns the leaking of state secrets.“What I’m doing here is being assessed as espionage,” Mr. Zarrab said, “and it is as if I had obtained all these assets based on my cooperation here.”In an unrelated legal action, on Wednesday Mr. Zarrab was sued by an inmate who claims Mr. Zarrab sexually assaulted him when the men shared a cell in a different jail, the Metropolitan Correctional Center, in Manhattan.The inmate’s lawsuit said the abuse, which included rape, occurred between November 2016 and March 2017, when the men were cellmates.Robert J. Anello, a lawyer for Mr. Zarrab, said on Thursday, “The allegations are outrageous and false from a source that is not remotely credible.”The inmate’s lawyer, Alexei Schacht, said an inquiry by the jail had found the complaint to be unsubstantiated. That meant, he said, only that officials there had concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish whether the assault had occurred.A spokesman for the jail did not respond to a request for comment.The inmate, who is not being identified because he is an alleged sexual assault victim, claims in the suit that he and Mr. Zarrab became friends in the jail and that Mr. Zarrab offered to pay for him to retain a private lawyer. Mr. Zarrab also had money wired to the inmate’s family in Africa and placed in the inmate’s commissary account, the lawsuit says.The inmate, who is in his early 60s, “felt helpless and unable to fight off the younger and stronger” man, the suit says, adding that the inmate was also “too scared and embarrassed at that time to complain or to seek help.”On March 8, the suit says, after the inmate again was attacked by Mr. Zarrab and began yelling and making noise, other inmates apparently complained to jail officials, as did the inmate himself.“Being in jail is a bad enough experience for someone,” said Mr. Schacht, the inmate’s lawyer, “and this just made his experience so much worse.”The inmate pleaded guilty in July to one count of conspiring to provide material support for a terrorist group and is awaiting sentencing in the federal court in Manhattan.Mr. Schacht, asked why he had filed the suit the week Mr. Zarrab was testifying in the sanctions case, said the timing was coincidental and largely a factor of his being retained recently to represent the inmate and of conducting his own investigation.A spokeswoman for the United States Attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment.', "DOHA, Qatar – French President Emmanuel Macron has arrived in Qatar for a one-day trip to the country amid a boycott of Doha by four Arab nations.Macron landed on Thursday and was to visit French troops stationed in the country, as well as talk to its ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.Macron's visit comes just after a planned two-day Gulf Cooperation Council meeting collapsed in just a few hours over the ongoing Qatar diplomatic crisis.Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates began their boycott in June over allegations that Doha supports extremists and has too-close relations with Iran.Qatar has long denied supporting extremists and shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Tehran.", 'Trump to Asia: Unite on North Korea, but Go It Alone on Trade - The New York TimesDANANG, Vietnam — President Trump has issued two starkly contradictory calls on his trip to Asia this past week: The nations of the world must rally behind the United States to confront the nuclear threat from North Korea, but they should expect America to go its own way on trade.Reconciling those messages will be hard, and it may determine the near-term fate of the United States as a Pacific power.In South Korea on Wednesday, Mr. Trump put on the mantle of a superpower leader. In a speech that crackled with the urgency of a Cold War manifesto, he told lawmakers there, “It is our responsibility and our duty to confront this danger together, because the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows, and the fewer the options become.”Two days later, in the Vietnamese resort city of Danang, where American troops once came ashore to fight Communist insurgents, Mr. Trump reverted to the protectionist themes of his presidential campaign. “There is no place like home,” he told Pacific Rim leaders, warning them that the United States would never again sign a regionwide trade agreement.At one level, the contradictory messages illustrate Mr. Trump’s transactional approach to statecraft — one that prizes individual victories over a unified theory of America’s role in the world. That pragmatism is also reflected in his singular brand of leader-to-leader diplomacy.From Tokyo to Beijing, Mr. Trump has played the dealmaker with foreign leaders, flattering them personally even as his administration pushes hard-edge views on economic issues.But the contradictions also reflect a more fundamental disarray in the presidency’s policy toward Asia. It seems caught between the geopolitical realism of Mr. Trump’s diplomats and the economic nationalism of his political aides.These competing impulses have left allies and adversaries alike confused about America’s motives and staying power. Over time, several experts said, the balancing act will be impossible to maintain.Already with China, Mr. Trump has had to soft-pedal his ambitious trade agenda in an uphill effort to persuade President Xi Jinping to do more to press the neighboring North Korean government.With the smaller nations of Southeast Asia, Mr. Trump may feel less pressure to compromise. His comments in Vietnam lacked the solicitous tone he had used in China and Japan, veering into the defiant populism he used on the campaign trail. Yet his go-it-alone message could drive these countries further into the orbit of China, which has moved at this meeting of Pacific leaders to fill the vacuum left by the United States.“The region is looking for a robust American presence, not just on security but on trade,” said John Delury, an associate professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, the South Korean capital. “For Trump to come with an ‘America First’ agenda leaves Asian leaders in the lurch.”Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to President Barack Obama, said Mr. Trump’s words would make Asian leaders “feel that the U.S. is less of a factor in the region.”“They’re always looking for hedges against local bullies, like China,” he added, “and the U.S. is much less of a hedge.”Indeed, Mr. Trump was the odd man out at this meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. The other 20 leaders formally endorsed the idea of a liberal trade regime, arbitrated by the World Trade Organization, and condemned moves to erect new barriers.“We recognize the work of the W.T.O. in ensuring international trade is rules based, free, open, fair, transparent, predictable and inclusive,” the members wrote in their joint statement released on Saturday, using language that American negotiators had reportedly resisted.On Friday, Mr. Trump railed against the W.T.O., accusing it of treating the United States unfairly. Rather than uphold principles of free trade, he said, it contributed to a systematic exploitation of Americans, in which “jobs, factories and industries were stripped out of the United States.”While Mr. Trump vowed never to sign a regional trade deal like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which he withdrew the United States early in his presidency, the remaining 11 members of that deal agreed on Saturday to press on with it, creating a “broader free-trade area” across Asia that will pointedly exclude the United States.As the Pacific leaders gathered here on Saturday, much of the attention focused on whether Mr. Trump would meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.The White House steered clear of a formal meeting, though the two men conferred briefly. The United States and Russia later issued a joint statement on Syria that reaffirmed previous commitments to defeat the Islamic State and to untangle conflicts between their respective forces on the Syrian battlefield.Until Saturday evening, when Mr. Trump unloaded to reporters on Air Force One about Mr. Putin and the investigations into Russian election meddling, this trip had been a surprisingly disciplined exercise for the president.With a jam-packed schedule, he had tweeted sparingly and kept generally on message. The White House cut down on unscripted moments, limiting media access and acquiescing to the Chinese reluctance to allow questions after his joint statements with Mr. Xi.But Mr. Trump let loose on Sunday morning, when he fired back at North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, after North Korean state media disparaged him as a “lunatic old man.”“Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’” Mr. Trump said on Twitter, “when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’ Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend.”Mr. Trump had avoided ridiculing Mr. Kim personally during this trip, though he listed a catalog of North Korea human rights abuses during a speech in Seoul, which drew the angry response from North Korea.At a news conference on Sunday, Mr. Trump also said that he was open to being friends with Mr. Kim. “Strange things happen in life,” he said on a podium next to Vietnam’s president, Tran Dai Quang. “It’s certainly a possibility. If that did happen, it would be a good thing for — I can tell you — for North Korea, but it would also be good for lots of other places, and it would be good for the world.”Throughout the trip, his face-to-face meetings with leaders have been harmonious — even leaders, like President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, with whom he has differences. That is in keeping with Mr. Trump’s pattern throughout his presidency, though it was perhaps never as striking as in Beijing, where he lavished praise on Mr. Xi, only to criticize China’s trade practices a day later in Vietnam.“There is some value in treating counterparties with respect, in trying to build relationships with them, despite the distasteful nature if it,” said Mr. Bader, the former Obama official.But if Mr. Trump’s stops in Northeast Asia were aimed at building a coalition against North Korea, his swing through Southeast Asia seemed calculated to remind people that he has little use for the post-World War II concept of the United States as global leader.At moments, his speech in Vietnam had the tub-thumping atmosphere of one he may have given in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. When a member of the audience broke into applause after he accused countries of not opening their markets to American goods, a sardonic Mr. Trump exclaimed: “Funny. They must have been one of the beneficiaries.”Administration officials framed the speech as a chance for Mr. Trump to promote a “free and open Indo-Pacific,” which the White House has embraced as its answer to Mr. Obama’s “Asia pivot.” But the president put little meat on the bones, emphasizing the sovereignty and independence of nations over common interests or universal rights.“Human rights are, in essence, an international agreement,” said John Sifton, the director of Asia advocacy for Human Rights Watch. “When he talks about trade in those terms, it suggests that he doesn’t hold the multilateral legal system in very high regard — and that’s frightening.”Human rights groups, Mr. Sifton said, were focusing their energies on lobbying Canada and Japan rather than the United States.Chinese leaders do not dwell on human rights either, to say the least. But Mr. Xi came to Vietnam primed to take over some of the ground usually commanded by the American president. During his speech, which came right after Mr. Trump’s, he declared, “Opening up will bring progress, and those who close down will inevitably lag behind.”In the absence of an alternative sales pitch from the United States, experts said, China will inevitably make further gains.“China has made significant inroads in cultivating Southeast Asia,” said Tang Siew Mun, head of the Asean studies center at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. “This isn’t an entirely bad proposition for the region, but China’s success is disastrous for the U.S., as Chinese advances are at the U.S.’s expense.”“At the end of the day,” Mr. Tang said, “‘America First’ may devolve into the U.S. being home alone.”', 'Trump’s Travel Ban to Be Replaced by Restrictions Tailored to Certain Countries - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — President Trump is replacing his ban on travelers from six majority-Muslim countries with severe restrictions on visitors from nations he has determined do too little to protect against terrorists and criminals coming into the United States, officials said on Friday.The new travel restrictions could include indefinite bans on entry until vetting procedures and security cooperation improves, officials said. They will go into effect as soon as Sunday, after the conclusion of a 90-day policy review undertaken as part of the administration’s original travel ban.Officials said Mr. Trump will soon announce the list of countries subject to the travel restrictions. They declined to say whether the list would include all six countries from which travel was temporarily banned by a revised executive order in March: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.The president hinted that the changes were coming in a tweet after a crude bomb exploded on a London Underground train last week: “The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific,” Mr. Trump wrote. Officials said Mr. Trump was given a “decision brief” on the travel ban by senior officials during a meeting Friday at the president’s Bedminster club.The announcement is the culmination of the biggest legal challenge to Mr. Trump’s presidential authority since he took office. It came just over two weeks before the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in lawsuits that claim Mr. Trump exceeded his authority and defied the constitution by banning entry from the six countries.“We need to know who is coming into our country. We should be able to validate their identities,” said Miles Taylor, the counselor to the secretary of homeland security. He said the new restrictions represent a significant increase in toughening “national security standards and protecting the homeland.”The administration’s critics expressed deep reservations about the new restrictions and left open the possibility that they will file additional legal challenges once the list of countries is revealed.“We tend to look at anything coming out of this White House with a great deal of skepticism,” said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “While it has been clear that a neutral vetting system across the board needs to be looked at on its merits, this seems to be a third rescue of the failed Muslim ban.”In stark contrast to the original travel ban, which was implemented with virtually no notice only days after Mr. Trump took office, officials said the new travel restrictions were developed after intense negotiations with security officials in countries around the world.Those officials were given standards they must meet in order to avoid travel restrictions, including the ability to verify the identity of a traveler, communicate electronic passport information, use biometric devices and share information about terrorist and criminal networks with the United States.Countries that did not meet those standards as of mid-July were given 50 days to comply or face the threat of severe travel restrictions, officials said.“It was crystal clear,” Mr. Taylor told reporters on Friday. To countries who failed to meet or accept the new requirements, Mr. Taylor said, the message from American diplomats was blunt: “You will face potential consequences from the United States.”In the end, officials said that some of those countries added measures to improve security for passports and to better identify potential terrorist threats. They will not face additional travel restrictions. But other countries either could not meet the tougher vetting standards or willfully refused to engage with the United States government.People in the countries that will be identified by Mr. Trump will soon face new travel restrictions, officials said.“The Trump administration will ensure that the people who travel to the United States are properly vetted and those that don’t belong here aren’t allowed to enter,” said Jonathan Hoffman, the assistant secretary of homeland security for public affairs.Mr. Trump’s original ban blocked all travel to the United States by refugees as well as nationals of seven countries, including Iraq, which was later deemed to have improved its screening of potential travelers and was taken off the banned list.The ban caused chaos at airports around the country and prompted a torrent of criticism from immigrant rights activists, lawmakers in both parties, business executives, academic leaders and diplomats from around the world.A furious legal assault on the president’s travel ban delayed its implementation for months, as federal judges agreed with immigrant rights groups that the original ban unconstitutionally targeted a particular religion or exceeded the president’s statutory authority to block immigration. In June, the Supreme Court allowed the travel ban to take effect, with some significant restrictions, while the justices consider the merits of the case.The changes to be announced this weekend could have a profound impact on the court case, complicating the review by the justices and potentially making parts of the case moot even before the oral arguments, which are scheduled for Oct. 10.Officials from the Department of Justice declined to answer questions about whether they intend to take any actions related to the court case before the oral arguments. A spokesman for the department told reporters that “we are continuing to vigorously defend the president’s executive order.”The original travel ban included restrictions on entry into the United States by refugees from around the world. The new rules do not appear to alter the limits on refugees, leaving that question open for the Supreme Court to decide.The justices are likely to seek new input from lawyers for the government and for the groups challenging the travel ban before arguments begin.Restrictions on travel are not unique to the Trump administration. The Department of Homeland Security employs almost 2,000 people in about 80 countries around the world screening high-risk travelers seeking to visit the United States.For years, customs officers in the Immigration Advisory Program worked with airline employees and foreign security officials to review passenger ticketing data and examined documents in an attempt to detect fraud. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents and State Department counterterrorism officials are also stationed at diplomatic posts to screen visa applicants for ties to terrorism, drug smuggling and human trafficking and to help ensure that ineligible applicants do not receive visas.Dozens of officers at the National Targeting Center, which is run by Customs and Border Protection, have combed through passenger lists and cargo manifests since the days after the Sept. 11 attacks. Officers help identify which passengers should be subject to additional questioning by customs officers.Mr. Trump and his national security officials have argued from the beginning that the travel ban was intended to give the government time to ensure that those practices were sufficient to make sure that terrorists are not able to enter the United States using travel documents for people on vacation or seeking temporary employment.Critics accused the administration of basing threat assessments of travelers solely on the religion of the majority of people who lived in the nations identified by the executive order.Some counterterrorism experts say a targeted vetting system that screens individuals on a case-by-case basis makes more sense than a total ban on travelers from certain countries.“Vetting those coming to the United States against the broadest array of intelligence and law enforcement information is good security. Banning people because of their religion, ethnicity or country of origin is not good security and counter to our constitutional principles,” said John D. Cohen, a professor at Rutgers University and a former senior Homeland Security Department official during the Obama administration.Mr. Cohen other counterterrorism experts said the Trump administration should beef up the existing programs that are intended to prevent criminals and national security threats from entering the country.', 'Trump Should Bet on Kurdish Independence - The New York TimesNo one likes winning more than President Trump. He has a chance to prove it on Monday, when Iraqi Kurds hold a referendum on their independence.There is no shortage of losers in the Middle East, but anyone in the business of spotting winners should bet on an independent Kurdish state. Backing the Kurds is not only strategically smart — they are a steadfast ally in the fight against the Islamic State and Islamist extremism, doing battle alongside American soldiers — it’s also the right thing to do.Yet the Trump administration has worked to prevent the referendum, arguing that with the war against the Islamic State yet to be won, a vote could risk further dividing an already fractious coalition. In a statement, it called the referendum “provocative and destabilizing.”This is a serious mistake. In failing to offer full-throated support for Kurdish independence, the United States is focusing solely on the short-term volatility of the region and overlooking serious medium- and long-term opportunities.There’s no denying that the Middle East is a mess: To truly stabilize the region, we need to defeat the Islamic State, replace the brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and contain Iran, which still threatens to go nuclear. But the best way to stamp out darkness isn’t through military might, but through light. And an independent Kurdish state would be a beacon of hope in a part of the world where hope is desperately needed.An independent Kurdish state would be a victory for democratic values, national self-determination and the rights of women and minorities. Is there a more iconic image of the fight against the Islamic State than that of female Kurdish peshmerga fighters doing battle on the front lines against jihadists who demand the subjugation of women? An independent Kurdish state would empower these warriors in a part of the world where women and girls are typically second-class citizens.In addition to its commitment to gender equality, Kurdistan has also shown its commitment to minority rights. Over the past three years, Kurdistan, which is about the size of Maryland, has taken in nearly two million refugees, including Assyrians, Yazidis, Turkmen, Shabaks and Christians fleeing the Islamic State and sectarian violence in other parts of Iraq and in Syria.Even without a formal state, the Kurds have built a society that meets many of the criteria of statehood. They are economically viable, with a well-developed energy industry. They have functioning institutions, including elections for Parliament and a relatively free media. And they’ve proved capable of defending themselves against the Islamic State without attacking others.Kurdistan is already, in values and governance, a democratic nation in waiting. Is it a perfect Jeffersonian democracy? No. Does it have a long way to go? Yes. But in a region where tyranny is the norm, it’s on the right track.With a state, the Kurds could become an even more valuable and constructive ally against extremism. That would be in the American interest, but just as important, it would be a fulfillment of American values. Supporting Kurdish independence means supporting the right to self-determination of a people that have overcome oppression, persecution and tyranny to build a thriving, vibrant society. That’s one of the reasons Israel supports the Kurds’ right to self-determination.Some 30 years ago, the Kurdish people were being choked with chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein. Today they stand as a nation reborn, about to embark on an inspiring exercise in democracy. We have a moral duty to support its outcome. In a region where the flags of liberal democracies are routinely set alight, Kurdistan has chosen to embrace liberal democratic values.Now the United States faces a critical choice. President Trump has the chance to demonstrate American leadership, promote American values and strengthen an American ally. Israel would welcome his support for the Kurds. And if handled intelligently, the pragmatic Arab states such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates could follow suit, on the grounds that Kurdistan could serve as a bulwark against Iran and the Islamic State.If we wait for the region to be perfectly stable, for Islamist extremism to disappear or for the collective blessing of Ankara, Tehran and Baghdad, we could be waiting forever. If, however, the United States wants to support a stabilizing, modernizing and democratic force, the choice is clear: Mr. Trump should bet on a winner and support an independent Kurdish state.', 'Is Trump All Talk on North Korea? The Uncertainty Sends a Shiver - The New York TimesWASHINGTON — When President Trump gave a fiery campaign speech in Huntsville, Ala., on Friday evening, he drew a rapturous roar by ridiculing Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, as “Little Rocket Man.”Among diplomats and national security specialists, the reaction was decidedly different. After Mr. Trump repeated his taunt in a tweet late Saturday and threatened that Mr. Kim and his foreign minister “won’t be around much longer” if they continue their invective against the United States, reactions ranged from nervous disbelief to sheer terror.Mr. Trump’s willingness to casually threaten to annihilate a nuclear-armed foe was yet another reminder of the steep risks inherent in his brute-force approach to diplomacy. His strengths as a politician — the ability to appeal in a visceral way to the impulses of ordinary citizens — are a difficult fit for the meticulous calculations that his own advisers concede are crucial in dealing with Pyongyang.The disconnect has led to a deep uncertainty about whether Mr. Trump is all talk or actually intends to act. The ambiguity could be strategic, part of an effort to intimidate Mr. Kim and keep him guessing. Or it could reflect a rash impulse by a leader with little foreign policy experience to vent his anger and stoke his supporters’ enthusiasm.His new chief of staff and his national security team have drawn a line at trying to rein in his more incendiary provocations, fearing that their efforts could backfire with a president who bridles at any effort to control him. What remains unclear — and the source of much of the anxiety in and out of the government and on both sides of the Pacific — is whether they would step in to prevent the president from taking the kind of drastic action that matches his words, if they believed it was imminent.Veterans of diplomacy and national security and specialists on North Korea fear that, whatever their intended result, Mr. Trump’s increasingly bellicose threats and public insults of the famously thin-skinned Mr. Kim could cause the United States to careen into a nuclear confrontation driven by personal animosity and bravado.“It does matter, because you don’t want to get to a situation where North Korea fundamentally miscalculates that an attack is coming,” said Sue Mi Terry, a former intelligence and National Security Council specialist who is now a senior adviser for Korea at Bower Group Asia. “It could lead us to stumble into a war that nobody wants.”And while his bombast may be a thrill to Mr. Trump’s core supporters, there is evidence that the broader American public does not trust the president to deal with North Korea, and is deeply opposed to the kind of pre-emptive military strike he has seemed eager to threaten.A new Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 37 percent of adults trust Mr. Trump “a great deal” or “a good amount” to responsibly handle the situation with North Korea, while 42 percent trust him “not at all.” By contrast, 72 percent trust American military leaders, who have largely avoided combative language on North Korea even as they have said publicly that a military option is possible.Two-thirds of respondents opposed launching a pre-emptive attack against North Korea, while about three-quarters supported using tougher economic sanctions on Pyongyang as a way of pressuring the country to surrender its nuclear arsenal.Some senior administration officials acknowledge privately that Mr. Trump’s rhetoric on North Korea is not helpful, although they question whether it will alter the discussion, given how far Mr. Kim has come in his quest to develop a nuclear weapon that could reach the United States.The three current and retired generals advising Mr. Trump — Jim Mattis, the defense secretary; Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, his national security adviser; and John F. Kelly, his chief of staff — as well as Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, have all chosen their words on North Korea more carefully, emphasizing the role of diplomacy and the grave stakes of any military confrontation.“All three of the generals fully realize the carnage that would result from a war on the Korean Peninsula,” James G. Stavridis, the former NATO commander and current dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said on Sunday.“Knowing each of them personally, I am certain they are counseling operational caution, measured public commentary and building a coalition approach to dealing with Kim Jong-un,” Mr. Stavridis, a retired admiral, said in an email. “But controlling President Trump seems incredibly difficult. Let’s hope they are not engaged in mission impossible, because the stakes are so high.”Christopher R. Hill, a former ambassador to South Korea who served Republican and Democratic presidents, argued that the comments could badly undercut Mr. Trump’s ability to find a peaceful solution to the dispute, playing into Mr. Kim’s characterization of the United States as an evil nation bent on North Korea’s destruction and relieving pressure on the Chinese to do more to curb Pyongyang.“The comments give the world the sense that he is increasingly unhinged and unreliable,” said Mr. Hill, the dean of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver.Mr. Hill, who as envoy to South Korea under George W. Bush was the last American to hold formal talks with the government in Pyongyang, said he and Condoleezza Rice, then the secretary of state, routinely advised Mr. Bush to “avoid the personal invectives,” because “they never help.”“My sense from four years of those talks is that getting personal is not helpful,” Mr. Hill said. “Who could be telling Trump otherwise?”Yet current and former senior officials said it was clear that Mr. Trump would continue his brinkmanship, particularly his belligerent tweets, no matter what his advisers do or say. One former administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal policy workings, said nobody, including Mr. Kelly, could control the president’s social media utterances, despite what his military advisers thought about them.The tweets most likely have forced Mr. Mattis and Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as other national security officials, to spend a significant amount of time on the phone reassuring counterparts about Mr. Trump’s intentions.Last week, Mr. Trump coined his mocking nickname for Mr. Kim on Twitter and insisted on including it in his maiden speech to the United Nations General Assembly. “Rocket Man,” he said, “is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime,” which may leave the United States “no choice than to totally destroy North Korea.”The speech drew audible gasps from the diplomats and national security officials in the General Assembly hall, as well as an angry response from Mr. Kim himself, who called Mr. Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.” A few days later, a capacity crowd at the Von Braun Center in Huntsville delighted in Mr. Trump’s warlike language, cheering as he renewed his threats and added a dig at Mr. Kim’s stature.“He should have been handled a long time ago,” Mr. Trump said, “but I’m going to handle it because we have to handle it: Little Rocket Man.”“I’m sure he’s listening, because he watches every word,” Mr. Trump added. “He’s watching us like he never watched anybody before, that I can tell you.”The president appeared to be right about that. On Saturday, Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho of North Korea said in a speech at the United Nations that the president’s threats were “making our rocket’s visit to the entire U.S. mainland inevitable all the more.”That is what appeared to have prompted the nighttime tweet from Mr. Trump, who spent the weekend at his Bedminster, N.J., golf resort. “If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man,” Mr. Trump wrote of Mr. Ri, “they won’t be around much longer!”Ms. Terry said such menacing talk could put Mr. Trump into a box. “Trump is limiting our own options by behaving and speaking like this, because now we either have to act, which really is unthinkable, or we’re going to look like a paper tiger because we can’t act,” she said. “Internationally, we look foolish, and now he has made it extremely personal, so Kim Jong-un cannot back down. It’s reckless.”Some of Mr. Trump’s allies argue that his behavior is strategic, a way of telegraphing to North Korea — and to its primary patron, China — that the United States is taking a tougher line under this administration. There may be wisdom, they argue, in spurring fear and confusion in the mind of a leader who frequently relies on both.“We’re dealing with somebody that we’ll figure out,” Mr. Trump said at the rally on Friday. “He may be smart, he may be strategic — and he may be totally crazy.”', 'Kurds Voted for Independence. Here’s Who Else Has a Say. - The New York TimesSeveral million Kurds in Iraq have taken a symbolic step toward achieving a dream deferred since the end of World War I: establishing a homeland of their own.Often described as the world’s largest ethnic group without a distinct state, more than 30 million Kurds are spread across five countries. After decades of repression, millions of Kurds have generally thrived within their autonomous region in Iraq over the past two decades.But their step toward trying to declare an independent Kurdistan has angered the region’s biggest powers to the point of military action being threatened. And even the Kurds’ staunchest ally, the United States, has said it will not support independence.Here is a look at how the Kurds got to this point, and at the web of strained international relations that surrounds them.On Monday, three million people living in the semiautonomous Kurdish Region of northern Iraq voted overwhelmingly in support of seeking independence in a nonbinding referendum. The region, unofficially known as Kurdistan, has its own government and schools, and a security force known as the pesh merga.The Kurds’ most important resource is oil. Erbil, the region’s capital, is an oil boomtown. And after the Iraqi military fled Kirkuk during the Islamic State’s offensive in 2014, the Kurds were able to seize full control of that city and its major oil fields, too. Independence would mean the Iraqi government losing any share of those lucrative resources — an outcome Baghdad has said it is willing to go to war to prevent.The détente between Iraq and the Kurds has only been a relatively recent development, and has never been strong, even though they are on the same side of the fight against the Islamic State. In the 1970s, Iraqi leaders sent Kurds to concentration camps and razed their villages. In the 1980s, when they sided with Iran in its war with Iraq, President Saddam Hussein killed more than 100,000 of them and attacked the city of Halabja with poison gas.A no-fly zone, imposed by the United States after the 1991 gulf war and a failed Kurdish uprising, protected the Kurds for years in northern Iraq. And after the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Kurds and the Iraqi government essentially had to get along, under pressure from American officials. But after the Kurdish referendum vote, Iraq has halted flights at the international airports and threatened to send troops to retake the Kirkuk oil fields and disputed areas.The Turkish government has long looked at any potential Kurdish state on its borders as an existential threat, possibly encouraging the millions of Kurds who live in southern Turkey — who have long been repressed by the government both culturally and militarily — to stage a breakaway of their own.Those fears have been forged by years of violent conflict with Kurdish militants within Turkey that has led to a death toll of 40,000 and rising. The militants — the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, better known as the P.K.K. — are officially considered terrorists by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The government in Iraqi Kurdistan has also publicly rejected them, but from time to time, the Turkish government has made military strikes into Kurdistan, saying that P.K.K. fighters were sheltering there.Now, the Iraqi Kurds’ move to support independence has led to concern that Turkey might go as far as invading to stop the process.Syria’s civil war, and the global fight against the Islamic State there, have provided an opportunity for the country’s Kurdish population — estimated at 300,000 before the war — to find some autonomy in northeastern Syria, near the Turkish and Iraqi borders. Kurdish fighters there were for years the United States’ ally of choice in fighting the Islamic State.But those same Kurdish fighters in Syria are also generally loyal to P.K.K. leadership, even though they take pains to use a different name. Their rise as a combatant force has alarmed Turkey, which has demanded that the United States stop supporting them and start shelling places in their territory.In general, the Kurds in Syria have tried to stay roughly neutral when it comes to the government of President Bashar al-Assad. And Syrian forces, consumed with major cities in the heartland, have mostly left them alone. But now that the balance of power has shifted in Syria, with interventions from Russia and Iran helping Mr. Assad defeat the network of insurgencies against him, there is a renewed possibility that the government will not look kindly on an armed and autonomous Kurdish region within its national borders.Washington has relied on Kurdish help in the Middle East for decades but has never officially backed plans for an independent Kurdish state.That is because the United States is also heavily dependent on its alliances with Turkey and Iraq, two nations crucial to regional stability and to the coalition to defeat the Islamic State, but which have both sworn to prevent Kurdish independence.The White House this week called the independence referendum in Iraq “provocative and destabilizing.” Brett H. McGurk, the United States special envoy to counter the Islamic State, described it as “a very risky process” with “no prospect for international legitimacy.”', 'As Kurdish Borders Close, War of Words Heats Up - The New York TimesERBIL, Iraq — The president of Iraq’s Kurdish region warned on Friday that the Kurds might be forced to retaliate if the central government persists with what his spokesman called a “very aggressive” stance toward the pro-independence referendum.Overseas flights were canceled on Friday from the international airport in Erbil, hours before a ban by the Iraqi government took effect, while officials in Baghdad warned that land borders might also be closed. There were also reports of internal highway closures.“We are hopeful that these are all temporary measures,” said Vahal Ali, director of communications in the office of Massoud Barzani, the Kurdish region’s president. “We want this to be a peaceful transition, but if Baghdad decides not, there is a lot we can also do.”Mr. Ali was critical of threats by Baghdad to ask Turkey to cut a vital oil pipeline, which provides most of the estimated $8 billion the Kurdish region earns annually from oil revenue, and a request from the Iraqi parliament to move troops into the oil-rich, Kurdish-held city of Kirkuk. “Baghdad’s response to the referendum was very aggressive, so we don’t know what will happen,” the spokesman said.Iraqi Kurds overwhelmingly voted in favor of independence in a referendum on Monday, which Mr. Ali said obliges Mr. Barzani to negotiate independence from the rest of Iraq. Baghdad has refused to enter such negotiations, and Mr. Ali said that if it maintained that attitude, Kurdistan would be forced to unilaterally declare independence.“President Barzani was obligated to conduct the referendum and now is obligated to respond to that result,” Mr. Ali said. “We’ve repeatedly said we can negotiate, but that has to be on the question of independence.”Kurdish officials have expressed dismay at the absence of support they have found internationally, with the United States and other powers, as well as the United Nations, critical of the decision to even hold the referendum, and none expressing approval for the pro-independence result.Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson bluntly expressed the American rejection of the referendum and its outcome in a statement released on Friday, saying “the vote and the results lack legitimacy.”Hoshyar Zebari, who helped lead the referendum drive in the Kurdish region and was formerly Iraq’s foreign minister, said that criticism of the vote from the United States had “emboldened Baghdad” to take a hard-line position toward the Kurds. Baghdad’s threatened retaliation was, he said, “very damaging and provocative, and illogical and destructive.”Mr. Ali said the Kurds were hopeful that international allies would eventually come around to the idea of Kurdish independence, and said they were heartened at some individual voices praising the referendum result. He cited, for instance, Charles E. Schumer of New York, the minority leader in the United States Senate, who on Wednesday praised the Kurdish independence vote.Iraq’s influential Shia spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, in his Friday sermon in the southern city of Karbala, was strongly critical of the Kurdish move. “Any individual steps toward division and separation and the attempt of making this thing reality will lead to internal and external reaction and bad consequences that would damage our dear Kurdish citizens in the first place and maybe lead to what is more dangerous than that, God forbid, and will give way for many regional and international sides to intervene in Iraqi affairs,” Ayatollah Sistani said.On Friday, military officials in Baghdad confirmed that the strategic highway linking Mosul and the northern city of Dohuk, in Kurdish-held territory, was closed by the Iraqi military for several hours. In addition, protests by civilians forced the closure of the Kirkuk-Baghdad highway on Friday. Saad al-Hadithi, the spokesman for Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq, said that land borders would also be closed between Iraq’s Kurdish region and Turkey and Iran, but there was no confirmation if that had happened.The Iraq border agency announced that it was sending convoys of police officers and Interior Ministry officials to guard three key land border crossings between the Kurdish region and Syria, Turkey and Iran beginning on Saturday.Mr. Ali said that he was aware of no such move and that it would be unconstitutional.He said that cutting off the Kurdish region’s trade with Turkey, which he said totals $17 billion a year, would hurt everyone.He also warned of measures that the Kurdish regional government could take if Iraq’s crackdown on air travel and the borders continued, including severing internet and mobile telephone coverage, much of it based in the region, and even the supply of cement, most of which comes from the region.“The list is very long. There’s a lot we can do, if we’re talking about that,” he said. “We could cut off communications. We can also close the Erbil International Airport to domestic flights, to Baghdad and Najaf.” That, he said, would hurt many Iraqi officials whose family members live in the Kurdish region. “The families of all their policy makers live in Erbil because it’s not safe in Baghdad anymore,” Mr. Ali said.Mr. Ali also scoffed at Iraqi threats to move troops into Kirkuk, the oil-rich city claimed by both Arabs and Kurds. Kurdish forces took control of most of the city after Islamic State extremists chased the Iraqi army out in 2014.“They’re talking about sending troops?” Mr. Ali asked. “They couldn’t enter Kirkuk under ISIS, they couldn’t liberate it then, and now?”Flights after 5 p.m. on Friday were canceled by international airlines flying out of Erbil, according to travelers at the airport. The Iraqi ban took effect at 6 p.m.Prime Minister Abadi’s office released a statement that the Kurdish region’s two international airports, in Erbil and Suleimaniya, could be reopened as soon as Kurdish officials transferred control of them to the federal government. Kurdish officials said that was not going to happen.The Kurdish region’s minister of transport, Mawlood Bowa Morad, accused the Iraqi government of having issued orders to shoot down any airliners that defied its ban on international flights into Erbil or Suleimaniya airports. “There is a military order that if any flights are coming in, they are going to shoot them down,” Mr. Morad said, during an interview at the nearly deserted Erbil airport after the 6 p.m. deadline had passed.Producing his smartphone, Mr. Morad displayed a scan of what he described as a document that had come from a high official in Prime Minister Abadi’s office, issuing the shoot-down order to the Ministry of Defense in Baghdad. Officials in Mr. Abadi’s office said that the document was a forgery, and that the official who supposedly had signed it was a retiree with no authority.', 'Turkey Sentences 40 to Life in Coup Attempt Against Erdogan - The New York TimesISTANBUL, Turkey — A court in southwestern Turkey handed down life sentences on Wednesday to 40 men, including senior military officers, for trying to assassinate President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It was the first high-profile verdict against those accused of plotting to overthrow him in a failed coup attempt last year.The defendants, who included senior military officers and men from Turkish special forces and combat search-and-rescue units, were accused of mounting a helicopter raid on a luxury hotel in the resort town of Marmaris, where Mr. Erdogan was vacationing with his family.The trial is one of over 40 mass proceedings being conducted around the country against people suspected of participating in the coup attempt on July 15, 2016. The plotters used helicopters, tanks and air force jets to bomb institutions, including the Parliament. Two hundred and forty-nine people were killed in the bloody effort to seize power.The attempt failed when Mr. Erdogan evaded capture and rallied supporters onto the streets to face down the coup. Loyal military officers also resisted.In the largest mass trials, several hundred military and air force officers stand accused of sending tanks to seize bridges and bases, and of ordering them to open fire on protesters and military jets to bomb targets. Also charged is the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is accused of orchestrating the coup attempt from his self-imposed exile in the United States.A former political ally of Mr. Erdogan’s, Mr. Gulen fell out with the president in 2013 over accusations of corruption. Since the coup attempt, thousands of his followers have been imprisoned and Turkey has demanded his extradition from Pennsylvania.Mr. Gulen was among those indicted in the Marmaris case, but no verdict was reached on the charges against him or two others also being tried in absentia. The judge announced that their trial will continue, news agencies reported.The Marmaris case is of personal interest to Mr. Erdogan. It is the only one in which he has formally applied to be considered an interested party.Two police officers were killed in the attack at the resort. Mr. Erdogan has said he received a warning about the coup attempt and left the hotel. He arrived by plane in his home city of Istanbul around the same time the rogue commandos arrived at the Marmaris hotel.Among those sentenced on Wednesday were Brig. Gen. Gokhan Sonmezates, who was accused of planning the Marmaris attack; Maj. Sukru Seymen of the Special Forces, who led it; and Petty Officer Zekeriya Kuzu, who was found hiding in a cave days after the coup attempt. All were given aggravated life sentences, the toughest penalty under Turkish criminal law.The death penalty was abolished in 2002 under judicial reforms made by Turkey while negotiating for entry to the European Union, but supporters of Mr. Erdogan and relatives of those who died in the coup attempt have called for it to be reinstated to punish those responsible.In the Marmaris case, 37 of the 46 defendants were special forces commandos. One officer was acquitted, 40 received life sentences, and two others received lesser sentences: A former military aide to Mr. Erdogan received a sentence of 18 years, and another officer 15 years.During the trial, which took place in the town of Mugla, some defendants admitted to taking part in the coup attempt but denied trying to assassinate the president. Major Seymen, the commander of the attack, said in testimony on the first day of the trial that the aim was to detain Mr. Erdogan.“I did participate in a coup, but not an assassination attempt,” he said, according to Turkish press reports. “General Sonmezates gave me the order. The order was to capture the president alive.”The major expressed his regret that the two police officers were killed in the clash that night.Some defendants complained that the trial was unfair, and said they were victims of a power struggle.“Words don’t mean anything here, as we didn’t have the chance to a fair trial,” Reuters reported one defendant, Gokhan Sen, saying. “We are just the grass that elephants trampled on during their fight.”', 'President Trump and Hillary Clinton are still going at it, and if Trump has his way, they\'ll square off again in 2020.President Trump tweeted Monday that he hopes “Crooked” Hillary Clinton runs for president again, even as the former secretary of state was telling an Australian media outlet that former FBI Director James Comey gave her the "shiv."“I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020? My answer was, “I hope so!” Trump tweeted.I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020? My answer was, "I hope so!"A Clinton spokesman did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment in response to the president’s tweet.If Clinton did, in fact, decide to run again in 2020, it would be her third attempt at the White House.Clinton has given little indication that she plans to run again, but instead has done a series of media interviews, promoting, “What Happened,” her new memoir which tells the full, 469-page “story” of the 2016 election, detailing what she “saw, felt and thought during two of the most intense years” she’s ever experienced.In her latest interview, Clinton borrowed a prison phrase to accuse Comey of costing her the election by re-opening the investigation into her private email server.CLINTON BOOK ADS VOTER ID LAWS TO LIST OF REASONS WHY SHE LOST“He did shiv me, yeah… we also know that opponents of mine, like former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, knew something was coming,” Clinton told Australia’s NewsCo.com. “So there was clearly an effort to detail my campaign at the end.”Clinton has repeatedly blamed Comey and the investigation into “Those Damn Emails” (the title of one chapter in her book), but has also said voter ID laws, Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts, women and other factors contributed to the loss in her second presidential run.Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.
